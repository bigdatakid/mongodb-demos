    "reviewTitle": "Great resort, disappointment in rooms",
    "reviewText": "We stayed in building 6, which had only been open for 1.5 months. I loved the idea of a new building which were all supposed to be suites. The rooms were not what I would call a suite. It did have a sofa which was a cheap round unusable sofa only good for laying clothes on. The room was clean, but was not what I would call a suite. We had a tough time sleeping as we could hear people walking above us and doors opening and closing all the time. We loved the views and the idea of a pool just outside our balcony, but the water was always cold, so we never used it. We loved the resort size, nice restaurants/bars, the wait staff was wonderful as well! If the rooms were more accommodating, we would go back, but with the room being so uncomfortable, we will most likely not return to this all inclusive.",

Every single person on the staff greeted us with smiles and were genuinely happy and cheerful. The staff seemed to be as happy as the guests, which made it so fun for us. Even the iguana living on the grounds seemed cheerful and well fed. The beaches were amazing and we took a snorkeling tour which was really super at Maroma beach at the other El Dorado hotel. It was overall one of the best experiences of our life and we plan to return as soon as we can.",

At least four times I had to ask for new room keys because the room access cards quit working. The printer in the business center printer did not print properly. The front desk called my room to tell me my taxi was waiting for me, whom I thought a friend sent to me. Turns out no one never called a taxi for me. The motel sent me someone else's taxi who I gladly took a ride in to my friends house to find out they never sent me a taxi. I paid for a taxi ride I didn't need because my friends were getting ready to come pick me up. I checked out early and the motel didn't want to comp me for checking out early.

    "reviewText": "I was in Irapuato for three nights. I decided to stay at this hotel because of its proximity to the church and wedding reception venue. The location couldn't have been better. It's right across from the Cibeles Mall and if you happen to miss the complimentary breakfast, which I did once, there's a convenient Starbucks right outside the hotel. People in the reception were friendly. We were offered a ride to the church in one of the hotel shuttles. At drop off, I found out it was complementary and gave the driver a tip. The area feels very safe as it is in one of the wealthier parts of Irapuato. The room was very clean and the pillows felt quite comfortable. The AC was quiet and the TV was the right size for the room. I was concerned with some reviews about noise and thin walls but I didn't hear any other guests perhaps because I requested a room in the 5th floor, or maybe there weren't that many guests. In any case, I was pleased it was pretty quiet. Also, I'm glad you get to mix your own chilaquiles at the complimentary breakfast area.. They keep the eggs, salsa, and tortilla chips separate. This is good for the international traveler who is not used to spicy food as my companion is. I enjoyed their healthy options like yogurt and fruit. Overall, great value!",

The standard rooms are amazing, the resort grounds is wonderful. My wife is a very picky eater and had concerns that she wouldn't be able to find many options for her to eat, which has been a problem at other resorts in the past. She had no problems with the food. The restaurant food was great. The staff was always there to help. At times it seems like there was more staff than patrons. Cons: We had very few complaints. The beach does have a seaweed problem, which is all over the area currently. The resort was out everyday removing seaweed. The resort was doing everything they could to take care of the problem. I can't blame the resort for this issue. The resort has 5 hot tubs. The hot tubs were never very hot, especially during the daytime. We were disappointed in that area. Currently the closest men's restroom to the pool was under construction, so you had to walk a long way from the pool area to find a restroom. The last complaint we had was the pools and hot tubs closed at 8pm. This would be a easy fix. Overall, we enjoyed the resort and plan on returning in the future.",

I wouldn't upgrade to swim up or club Excellence room as perks not worth it and all rooms are basically the same inside just some beach views and perks For example the swim up is just a 1st floor room where you can walk out through the slider to the pool area but there is a hammock in the way which isn't removable and you can't go around it so you have to crawl under it, very awkward. Other swim up room amenities include a standard size jet tub outside your slider which no one uses as you have a big jet tub in your room and outside tub has little privacy. Club Excellence just has a separate pool area which is the same as all other pools and some nicer(but not much nicer) seating and lounges on the club beach area. Also when they come around for drinks they offer snacks like shrimp. Also a small club only room where you can get drinks and food but resort has many restaurants so not a big perk to me. All level rooms I saw have a step down to the slider inside the room which is unsafe fall feature. The entertainment is weak but some of the musicians were pretty good. Need more activities. Beach is narrow and was covered with seaweed, a common problem for the area. I give the place a 3.5 to 4 stars out of 5.",

    "reviewText": "We stayed here early February 2016 for our honeymoon. Overall our experience was fantastic. Spice was our favorite restaurant for dinner. Barcelona has an awesome breakfast buffet. The staff was always ready to take our order at all bars and servers on the beach visited often to make sure drinks were full. We stayed in a ocean view swim up pool excellence club room. We didn't use our outdoor bed and the pool as much as we thought only because the sun was gone by noonish, which was too bad. Our room did have a musty smell that I was unfortunately excited to leave by the 7th day so I would stay in an upper level ocean view next time. We will definitely go back!! The room just wasn't 100 worth the upgraded cost for the club and the swim up portion of it. We didn't utilize the excellence club as much as others might.. So probably wouldn't do that again either. Many daily activities. The shows at night were great, for the most part.. We were looking forward to the Michael Jackson show which they advertised was going to be happening the Thursday night we were there but they changed it to the following Thursday, out of our control but I was disappointed as we heard such great things about it. We met many people who were visiting for the second time so that was encouraging to hear. We also heard from many others in all their travels elsewhere similar, this was the best place! Which I could definitely understand. Everything is a short walk away from your room! I suggest a visit! :)",

    "reviewText": "We absolutely loved staying at Excellence Riviera Cancun. The buildings, pools, bars, restaurants and grounds are very well kept and cared for everyday, all day. The food was ok. Mostly strange to us and odd flavors. But with room service and 5 restaurants we were able to find food we really liked. The bars are well stocked and you can order almost any drink you can think of. Our room was stunning, with granite floors, tall ceilings, beautiful architecture design, a huge shower with granite floors and walls, a jacuzzi tub and a beautiful view from our private balcony patio. We upgraded to the rooftop suit (because I loved it) which has a small pool, bed and patio furniture on the open roof. They took us to the room first so we could see if we wanted it before officially upgrading. The only complaints I had were these the room keys would go bad and we were locked out twice. Also once (that I know of) room service ignored our Do not disturb sign and came into our room anyways. The other is the Coco Loco drink, which is made from and in a fresh coconut. They only make this drink once a day, for a 30 minute timeframe. But no one knew when. We were told on 3 different occasions, 10:30-11am, 11-11:30am and 11:30-12pm. It was only offered on the beach and everyday we tried to get down there, we were told no, that we missed the timeframe. I was very irritated that no one could give us the correct time. It was like the drink didn't exist and they would tell us a time that was past",

    "reviewText": "We had a wonderful time here for our second trip. The resort was not as crowded due to renovations and the seaweed problem but still the staff was excellent. Food and drinks were very good. Room cleanliness was rated less than excellent because our room was not cleaned one day and the other days it wasn't cleaned until 5pm. Also the shower smelled and we never had a hot shower.",

The only thing I would really try to correct if possible, is the room had a bit of a funky mildewed scent, but being as how it's constantly humid I can kind of see why, and they had incense in the room I'm sure to help. The swim up room was perfect. Highly recommend.",

    "reviewText": "My husband and I stayed at the Excellence Punta Cana for our honeymoon in 2011 and loved it so when Expedia had a special one day deal (deals are legit, dropped 1000 and was back up the next day) we jumped on it hoping it would be similar. Excellence Riviera Cancun was even better! Rooms - Buildings 1-5 circle the lazy river. We were in building 4 in a swim-up suit and it was amazing. The gorgeous spa is located right across the lazy river in the center so every morning we heard spa sounds and smelled awesome spa smells. You could barely hear the main pool. The rooms were emaculate, the shower ginormous with a rain shower head, the bed was super comfortable, and you could freeze the room out if you wanted. I don't feel the Excellence Club would have been worth it here (we did it in the DR). Pools - Super clean and fun. The lazy river doesn't move fast but it's fun and relaxing. The main pool closest to the beach has all the activities and swim up bar. It got a little crazy but if you are in the mood it's a blast. Restaurants - Honestly everything was delicious especially in dinner restaurants. Breakfast and lunch were fine, buffets are always eh, but have a great variety. DINNERS WERE AMAZING! No reservations needed/taken. We only had to wait for the French and Asian restaurants one 30 min the others under 10 min. Everything else no wait. Spice was our favorite (went twice!)",

    "reviewText": "We were in search where to celebrate my husbands 60th birthday and we defiantly hit the nail on the head. We were overwhelmed with the friendliest of the staff, the beauty of the room and just how much the resort had to offer. From the check in with an offer of champagne to check out that consisted of hugs Excellence did not disappoint. We only had 3 nights so we did not even crack the surface of all the variety in restaurants or bars or even entertainment, all we did sample was great. Top shelf liquor and the food was delicious. Our last night we joined in on the Mexican fiesta and it was spectacular. Honestly if you want to feel pampered this is the place. We will return.",
