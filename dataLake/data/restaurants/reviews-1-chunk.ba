    "reviewTitle": "My room had smelled Pet Friendly",
    "reviewText": "I was traveling to a meeting arrived the night before at midnight. The main reasons why I gave only 2 stars are: My first impression was that the hotel is not well lit. I arrived at night and was uneasy. My room smelled bad. The odor was like a wet dog or urine. (probably because it is pet friendly and not cleaned well). The room was old. The carpet was very worn and did not look clean. When I stay at a hotel I pull back the sheets and mattress pad to look for bedbugs, lice, fleas, etc. There was no mattress cover, seems unsanitary (good news - no bugs) The bathroom towels were unacceptable. My bath towel had a large brown stain. Gross! The face cloth was hard and stiff. Lastly regarding the towels,there were only one of each kind. I found that to be strange and inconvienant . I did not have another bath towel besides the stain one. The bathroom ceiling was low and the fan was noticeably visible. It was dirty. I actually touched it and it was so dirty that it felt sticky. The continental breakfast was low standard. Powdered creamer, no half and half. Bagels in cellophone bags. I swear the orange juice was Tank. I expected real juice in Florida. I want to end on positive points. The Wi-Fi worked well. My alarm clock was busted but I did receive a wake up call. The location of the hotel is convenient. It is right on the main drag of hwy 19. By the way, I did write a note to the housekeeper so she could have an opportunity to improve the cleanliness.",

The best thing about this hotel is the private balcony, I paid more to over look the cannas and I'm glad I did because that was the only place I couldn't hear the highway traffic. The traffic wind was so bad that at night it sounded like someone was trying to get into the room. The door actually shook! The room itself was large and decorated shabby sheik, I could tell the furniture was newer but it had the old look about it. What bothered me most was the smell, it was a musty, mold smell and the sheets were the same way. The were so bad it was hard to sleep. I had to go get blankets to use from home, so that defeated the me time I needed. The bath room was nice, minus the very low toilet. The in room coffee pot is a joke and I had to buy one to have a real cup of coffee. Also trying to get ahold of the staff was crazy! The phone rang and rang before anyone picked up and everyone minus the young man who checked me in were rude and unfriendly. The house keeping staff saw I was trying to get on the elevator with the lugage cart and went up alone instead of letting me on. That was the only elevator that worked near me, the other was broken, and this one sounded like it was about to break as well. The whole place smelt bad and musty! I will not be staying there ever again!",

It looked okay from the outside, but it smelled very musty and old despite apparent attempts to keep it somewhat updated. My room, though kept clean, smelled musty and there was no weather stripping around the entryway door so lizards kept getting into my room (probably chasing the bugs that also got in). It had a balcony, but this is Floridatoo humid to be outside if you don't have to be. The fitness room was very small and had only a couple of pieces of the Quitman that were seriously updated. The continental breakfast was average or slightly below compared to what you get everywhere else. The bed, surprisingly, was very comfortable. The pillows were not the best I've ever had, but they weren't the worst either. The room furniture was extremely cheap two of the dresser drawers didn't even open, and the computer table was so shaky that I was almost afraid to put my laptop on it. This is just an awful hotel, but it is somewhat budget friendly. However, you get what you pay for these days so if you don't have a lot of money, there are worse places to stay.",

    "reviewText": "Check in was quick and reception were welcoming with a drink on arrival. We only stayed on a BB basis, but the breakfasts were good with plenty of choice. Our room was on the second floor and we had a good size room and balcony. The bathroom was a bit tired and some of the tiles around the bath were cracked. The floor was very dirty throughout our week stay. The entertainment was really good - it wasn't in your face and you could choose to join in if you wanted but could also be in your room and not hear any noise from the music etc. The location of the hotel is next to a small shopping mall. Although the sea is just in front of the hotel, the beach is not great here but if you walk a bit further down to the Elba Carlotta, it is much better with loungers and umbrellas available. Although there are two pools in the hotel, the water was too cold to swim in the pools, even the heated one. Overall, we would stay here again if we came to Caleta for a relaxing break.",

The bed was very hard for my comfort but I know some people prefer a hard bed. Breakfast was buffet style and not very appetising. There is a commercial centre next door and there was a very nice English restaurant that we would highly recommend. ' The Sea View' . This part of Fuerteventura is much more expensive than Corralejo. The hotel is about a 20 mins walk from the town but right opposite McDonalds, don't bother the meat is different here. The hotel is right on the flight path but the double glazing is good so did not bother us. The airport closes about 11.30 but the last flights arrive and depart much sooner. I think the airport opens about 7 or 8 am. Overall it was overpriced, not good value for money. Most guests were all inclusive, were not offered this option or would we have taken it anyway. The beer, wine and spirits are very poor quality. OK for young families I suppose.",

However, I also had a mani/pedi treatment. I noticed that the utensils and tools were just laying on a white towel and when given the pedicure she did not clean the foot tub. I thought maybe it had already been clean. Once I returned home I noticed a few weeks later I had toe fungus. I have never had fungus before and where I go in the Dallas area all tools come out of a bag that they are stored in once sterilized. I am confident I picked up the fungs at the Ritz. I have been fighting this fungus for months and its not fun. I called the Ritz and complained. I was told I would hear back what they are doing to correct their procedures in the Spa, but never heard a word back. While visting the Spa they were short handed and I have a feeling, the sterilizing of tools was not taken care of. They told me they always run with just a few employees so that they have work but the customer is the one suffering.",

The staff is outstanding friendly and helpful. They immediately make you feel welcome and it never stops throughout your stay. The rooms are beautiful and comfortable - very relaxing. We can't think of a better place to celebrate any event, but in particular a wedding or anniversary. It is romantic and classy and just the best place we have ever stayed. We can't say enough great things about it!",

    "reviewText": "I am happy to write a recommendation for the Ritz-Carlton Grande Lakes. My family (husband and 2 kids - 4 and 9 years of age) stayed here in February '08 for about 1-1/2 weeks. We made extensive use of their swimming pool facilities, and of their Concierge Club Level amenities. In the daytime, we did all the usual Orlando tourist activities. At night, we were absolutely thankful to have such a relaxing refuge, away from the theme park hustle and bustle. My in-laws who live nearby also visited us while we were there and they were especially psyched to spot John Travolta, reading a newspaper at the lobby. Thankfully, they didn't harass the poor person for photographs :) My children also enjoyed the Ritz Kids Club, while I took full advantage of their spa facilities. We are all very happy to have stayed here and we will definitely come back next year. Oh no, just remembering our experience makes me want to go back sooner, heehee!!!",

Everyone is friendly and remembers your name (and this is the largest Ritz Carlton I've ever stayed in...It's much bigger than most). The bar is wonderful and no request is too small or too great. The only thing that is lacking is the fine dining restaurant Normans. Normans is okay at best, but you'll do much better at the casual restaurant at the JW Marriott that is attached!",

The front desk refused to take any responsibility, blaming Expedia, despite the fact that it was clear that other customers were having booking related issues that night as well. To me, this is bad customer service, plain and simple. In the end, after 45 minutes, I was able to check in to one of the two rooms that I had booked. Better than nothing, but still the worst check-in experience I've had in many years. I would not recommend this hotel.",
