    "reviewText": "The place is beautiful and fufullied our vision for what we wanted for our wedding day. We did have issues with our out of town guest trying to book a room for our wedding day, many of them had to book a hotel room else where because they kept saying all the rooms were booked. It got taken care of about a week before my actual wedding, which was just a little too late. Communication was a bit difficult to through email and phone, but improved once it got closer to the wedding. Even though we had these issues, the day of the wedding made those issues obsolete. Brandon and the crew worked their butts off to help us and ended up having a beautiful wedding and everything flowed perfectly. No regrets going with Fort Conde Inn for our big day",
