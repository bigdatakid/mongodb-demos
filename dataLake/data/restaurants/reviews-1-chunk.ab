Room amenities explained - complimentary small bottles of water daily, pay for larger bottles plus anything out of the mini bar. Room serviced daily. Friendly staff - always a hello/good morning/afternoon. My first visit to Bali (dragged kicking and screaming) but very pleasantly surprised that I liked it and would return for chill out holiday to this resort. Kuta was too busy and the hotels very hotel like (closed in, door after door after door, thought Sully from Monsters' Inc would have a ball!). Kuta had the famed restaurants (Tony Romas, Bubba Gumps, Hard Rock etc) and though nothing wrong with those, I like the smaller local restaurants better. Beware of scammers and cons - check this info on line before you go to get an idea of what's happening - but go with an open mind and don't be put off by the constant hassles you get whilst walking the streets or shopping - just say no thanks and keep walking. Noticed that if something was say 9000rp and you gave 10000rp you didn't get change or they didn't have it - a scam in itself Perhaps, but as the exchange rate is most favourable and low wages in Bali I didn't mind, just be aware of this is what I'm saying. I didn't get a chance to get out and about but I'm told the temples and day trips are worth it. Hire a driver for the day, between 50-60AUS per day and you get their local knowledge.",

People were smoking in the dining room at breakfast time, and staff took no notice when complaints were made. Receipts were not given at poolside for any drinks etc. which were charged to our room so you had to keep a tally of what had been ordered. This was our 8th time in Bali, and we thought we would try somewhere different but won't do that again. On the whole, as cheap hotels go it wasn't too bad but we would not go back there again.

Think - smoked salmon, crisp pastries, espresso machine coffee made just for you, and even fresh sushi and sashimi made to order.Checking out time was flexible and arranged perfectly so that we could leave our bags for an hour at the hotel which we did not expect after previous experiences.We were treated like kings by the hotel staff during our stay, as a first experience of a 5 star hotel it was just great.Simply an elegant hotel offering what we all want - great service and accomodation!",

    "reviewText": "We were greeted with the utmost elegance when we got out of our taxi, we didn't have to lift a finger to carry anything - checking in took all of 20 seconds to sign a few bits of paperwork, then we were allowed to catch our breath with a cold drink before we were taken to our floor. Our room was one of the cheaper basic rooms by Mandarin standard however it could be compared to other hotels absolute best offerings! Calling room service always had a personalised greeting (caller ID), inroom dining was fantastic for a late night feast with some fresh salad and berries, rooms are kept immaculately clean and you always have plenty of towels and extras. Dining at breakfast time was superb as well, we showed up 20 minutes before end of breakfast and they still accommodated us wonderfully in a stunning restaurant by the garden offering traditional indonesian, japanese and international cuisine all for the buffet price. Think - smoked salmon, crisp pastries, espresso machine coffee made just for you, and even fresh sushi and sashimi made to order. Checking out time was flexible and arranged perfectly so that we could leave our bags for an hour at the hotel which we did not expect after previous experiences. We were treated like kings by the hotel staff during our stay, as a first experience of a 5 star hotel it was just great. Simply an elegant hotel offering what we all want - great service and accomodation!",

    "reviewText": "MO Jakarta is a good hotel, but comparing to Grand Hyatt, a same excellent hotel, MOJ's location is not that great, need to walk long way around the fountain to get into the Plaza Indonesia shopping mall. The executive lounge is better on food comparing to Grand Hyatt, but when you have visitors, it charges, that is certainly usual but not as generous as Grand Hyatt. That is why most of high end business visitors still stay at Grand Hyatt even though the room in MOJ is obviously better.",
