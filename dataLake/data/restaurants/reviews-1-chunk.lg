He kept looking through stacks of papers and yelling at customers because we did not have printouts from Expedia to prove we had a reservation.  I called help desk and then the clerk yelled at him for 5 minutes.  Then Expedia explained that they could not help me get a new hotel room until the clerk agreed to refund Expedia.  So no room and no money - but Expedia did offer my a $50 credit.  So I was stranded in San Antonio at 1 in the morning with a credit - soooooo helpful.  I asked to talk to a supervisor - was told that there was a 45 minute wait.  Hummm I guess the long wait is because none of your customers are happy.",
