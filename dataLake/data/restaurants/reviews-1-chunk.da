It's a lovely 100 year old hotel downtown but updated in key furnishings like bathroom, shower, awesome beds in spacious rooms (even the basic king room). Only 2 hotels (cheaper but yuck) closer to airport and this one will now always be my choice to stay again! Outside of rush hour, it's barely 10min to airport-very convenient. The restaurant food is outstanding--they're somehow connected with a culinary institute so menu isn't vast but quality everything. Shrimp grits and ham Mac cheese TDF!",

First, there are no restaurants in walking distance, so you will need to drive several miles to find a place to eat, except, of course, for breakfast, which is included in the room price and meets Holiday Inn Express standards.

If you've stay with holiday inn before its in line with others but a little more modern with a few more perks.
