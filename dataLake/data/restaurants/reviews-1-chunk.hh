The bus stop is round the corner where there are a few shops. Not many restaurants except La Bracerie about 300 metres away.

We were offered a very spacious and well appointed family room. Staff were very professional and helpful. The hotel is set in one of the better neighbourhood of Palermo (reviews stating the contrary were written by people who just have not seen enough of Palermo I suspect) with easy access to the motorway, city parks and the beach resort of Mondello. The airport is 20-25 minutes' drive away. All in all an excellent base to visit this city or, as was our case, for a quick stopover. If you have a car, the hotel offers a choice of options: there is an underground garage (chargeable, but car is fully insured) a private parking area (in theory there is access from the street but there are also many cameras) and a gated compound. The latter two options were offered free of charge. Breakfast was also very good in our opinion. Note that there are two different hotel names served by the same reception.
