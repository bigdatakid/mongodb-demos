The rooms themselves all have full kitchens, granite counters and very spacious. There is a sitting area with desk and flatscreen television as well as computer. The bedrooms are separate also with flat television. The beds were well made and designed and very comfortable. Along the back wall is floor to ceiling windows and because the rooms are designed with a loft atmosphere these windows are huge, perhaps 16 feet high. I loved the design of these rooms.

Finally around 5PM we were given a room, upgraded at no charge to a larger 1 bedroom suite. The rooms are nice and very spacious. Couple of concerns - the rooms only had sheer curtains (still waiting for the dark curtains to arrive) and the ceilings were bare cement with all sorts of construction markings on them. Kitchen did not have a trash can. The housekeeping crew came to knock at our door around 8AM on Sunday though we had the do not disturb button on. Overall an experience far below any expectations.

The room service is great, the rooms impressive and celebrities not only frequently stay in the hotel but many live in the residences. Lamborghinis and Bentleys often stand guard in front of the valet like hundred thousand dollar yard dogs. Despite the consistently affluent tenants, the customer service could be better, the pool is entirely too small and the facilities often are malfunctioning. When everything is up and running properly, which is unfortunately rare, this is a perfect place to stay while visiting the city.",

Prices are quite fair, they're set at a good inbetween range not too expensive and not too cheap. I think this place is especially great for business lunches when you're looking for a nice place to entertain a client, but don't want anything too upscale and foo foo. Lobby has a clean atmosphere, good service, tasty food, and everything is just very classy and sophisticated. I really enjoyed.",

The atmosphere is modern, sleek, and energetic. This place is great whether you are dining with a big group or with a date. I've tried many of the dishes here, but my favorites are (for appetizers) the tuna crudo, the PEI mussels, and the fried clams. The pizzas are OK -- nothing incredibly special, but still good. Try the pine nut pesto or the italian sausage, and you can never go wrong with the margherita pizza. The entrees here are good, but they may have changed the menu since I last went. I loved the salmon and they used to have an amazing steamed halibut dish that was to die for. Desserts and drinks are delicious here too - extensive, impressive wine list, fantastic, gorgeous cocktails (I recommend the pomegranate mojito). All in all, this is a great place to try -- I would recommend some of the other Concentrics restaurants before this one (like One Midtown Kitchen, Two Urban Licks, Murphy's, Trois), but if you're in the Atlantic Station area, it's worth a visit.",

We had to wait to place our order while our waiter bypassed us several times. The atomsphere is great, but he ruined it by the terrible service.

After we finished, I had to get up and find someone to get our waiter because we sat about 20 more mins with dirty dishes in our face and no check. Where's my waiter Then a non-english speaking guy comes to pick up the plates. How did he get a job, somebody please call INS. Where's my waiter Finally a manger tells me that she is sorry and he was running room service b/c she was short staffed. Not my problem. Then the Waiter gets irate w/me and tell me to pay him and not the manager. He never apologized for his lack of customer service. Don't expect much of the service to be great here.",

    "reviewText": "I have had 3 visits and never once dissapointed. The bartender to look for is Bob- warm and makes strong drinks! However, Charles accomedated our party on NYE and we had amazing service. He is so personal and kind and make The Lobby one of my TOP picks in Atlatna. Def. a NY style lounge/resteraunt. Something ATL needs more of :)",

    "reviewText": "I recently had lunch at Lobby at 12, and I have to say I really don't have anything negative to say about my experience. I had a wood grill pizza, and I loved it and would definately order one again. The atmosphere is very classy casual, but yet they treat you like you're in an upscale fancy restaurant. Prices are quite fair, they're set at a good inbetween range not too expensive and not too cheap. I think this place is especially great for business lunches when you're looking for a nice place to entertain a client, but don't want anything too upscale and foo foo. Lobby has a clean atmosphere, good service, tasty food, and everything is just very classy and sophisticated. I really enjoyed.",

    "reviewText": "This was our first time at Lobby. We have eaten at other Concentric restaurants and thought this would be a good choice for Holiday Dinner, so we made reservations for the buffet (44/person). The food was disappointingly very average and uncreative -- not like their other restaurants. Most bothersome, however, was the absence of many of the advertised dishes, with no comparable substitutions, or apologies. Never saw the crab claws, sprouts with smoked bacon roast garlic, chicken watercress soup, the creamy pasta w/ mushrooms and Parmesan, or the assorted rolls (there was choice of one kind of hamburger-type bun). Couldn't believe the green bean casserole was actually the pedestrian classic with the fried onions on top. (Not sure if Campbell's soup was an ingredient but wouldn't be surprised.) They added-- perhaps in place of that fancy pasta-- sharp cheddar mac 'n cheese. There were substitutions on the dessert table, too, which included 2 pumpkin offerings. (Staff really needed to freshen up this table-- it was an unappealing mess). The turkey was moist and flavorful, the salmon was fresh, and the bliss potatoes (red peel included) creamy and delicious. Some of the salad greens were a bit slimy, but we picked those bits out and enjoyed the rest. Again, just average. The atmosphere is pleasant contemporary design: casual, cafe-like with all hard surfaces, and consequently with a moderately high noise level. We sat alongside the window and it was very cold, drafty. The service was exceptional (this WAS a buffet, keep in mind) and the 18 gratuity was conveniently included on our bill-- that, plus a 24 bottle of wine got the TWO of us out the door for just under 145. Merry Christmas.",

They were incredibly fluffy and served with homemade peach melba preserves and toasted walnuts. I have also had dinner at Lobby, and I can say that this restaurant is fabulous all around.",
