We set it to 60 and left for 2 hours...still hot but tolerable with the ceiling fan. Not enough towels or wash rags. Loud screaming young kids in the pool until 10;15pm on Thursday night. Room needed updated 5-10 years ago. Breakfast was average. Super staff, though.",

The place is rundown but the rooms are spacious and the AC keeps it cool. Convenient drive to SeaWorld and downtown San Antonio. Lots of restaurants, movies, shopping in the immediate area. Drawbacks: beds are just ok, only got 1 roll of tp and had to ask for more at the front desk (annoying), only got 2 towels and never got more despite asking several times, never made the \"complimentary breakfast\". They had coffee out but I didn't see any breakfast offered unless it was made to order for free. It was a bit loud Thursday night with people walking back and forth and hanging out at the pool, but surprisingly Fri was quieter. People at this motel tend to hang out outside and were often just outside our door area in a nonthreatening way.",
