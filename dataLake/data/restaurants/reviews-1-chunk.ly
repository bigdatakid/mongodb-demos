You have to update your key card everyday, sometimes more than once a day. Guests are responsible for emptying their own trash. This is a motel that houses people for weeks at a time. Barricaded the door the first night.",

They provided an assortment of cereals, bread for toasting, and make your own waffles. I didnt see any juices but they did have milk that was warm from being left out. A bit noisy if your room is by the pool since it was a gathering place. The front desk person was very nice. The AC in my room didn't work well. Overall, not a bad place to stay if your on a budget and don't mind an older hotel.",
