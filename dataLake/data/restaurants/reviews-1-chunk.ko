When we went to the room the linen was full of hair. We called the front desk and they were very accommodating and gave us a new set but at this point we were very disappointed . The hotel is also only 3 floors and it took what felt like forever for the elevator to come. Over 10 minute waiting time on average . They don't have any other elevators and were transporting the garbage on the same elevators as the guests which stunk the elevator up like a garbage disposal. When we needed to get any dinnerware we had to ask at the front desk because the room had none and we had to wait for it to be washed because apparently they don't have any clean ones readily available. We will not be staying at this extended stay hotel ever ! It's sad because the front desk staff was extremely nice as well.",
