The beds looked like they have not been WASHED in YEARS. It was soo dirty I could not even look at the rest of the room. The smell was out of this world someone should really close them down for good. I went last weekend and to this day ( almost a week later) I cant even close my eyes without seeing the images of that NASTY room. PLEASE SAVE YOUR TIME, MONEY AND SIGHT.",
