    "reviewText": "We enjoyed our stay but it was only for one night. It was a little awkward set up and the hotel rooms were in the back of the golf course. These are more like condo hotel rooms But they were nice- they need more lighting when driving in there at night trying to find your room.",

    "reviewTitle": "Beautiful Property located just outside of Tampa",
    "reviewText": "We found this property on Expedia and did not realize it is more like a gated community than a hotel. The resort is a little dated looking from the architecture but the rooms were nice and the beds were extremely comfortable. The only downside was that we reserved the smallest of rooms so there was not a mini fridge or microwave (we did not think we would need it at the time of booking). It was so late when we arrived that we did not have much time to look around but the restaurant at the clubhouse was open and had great live music. The food was also amazing! Not what we expected since most resorts are high price - low quality. There was so much food but since we did not have a mini fridge or microwave we could not take the leftovers. Since checkout was not until noon, it gave us plenty of time to explore the grounds and take a stroll on the nature walk. There are so many beautiful plants and the area is so peaceful. We will be sure to visit the resort again when we have more time so we can check out the pool and spa facilities.",

I wish the restaurants was more affordable, that was not family friendly. The housekeeping staff was wonderful. She did an amazing job. Everyone on staff was very helpful. Would come again, but will bring our own food.",

Now, the room was a bit musty smelling and the jacuzzi didn't work the 2nd day, but that was minor. This place is definitely worth the money! I'll go again for the pool alone! Also the staff was really nice too.",
