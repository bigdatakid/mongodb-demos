Carpet throughout the hotel in public areas looked liked it hadn't been vacuummed for several days, poor design. We couldn't imagine eating breakfast at this hotel due to its uncleanliness. I have to say the front desk staff were very nice ( no smiles though) and appeared to be really understaffed both days we were there.

There's also some meeting/convention rooms that are used by church and tour groups. Fortunately groups eat in a separate breakfast area. Breakfast was very basic. Inside is a car rental shop. The business center is in the hallway. Front desk provided cookies at night and coffee/water in the hallway. The non-front doors weren't secured by room key access alone, rather they were open to anyone who wanted to wander in. The room door was not neatly lined up with the door jamb, but the lock worked. There were also a lot of student groups staying to visit DC- they were loud and noisy at night but eventually went to sleep. There is ample parking. They share a shuttle van to Springfield Franconia Metro station with the Wyndham next door, which may have been a bit nicer hotel. I probably won't stay there again. But not bad if just passing through a need a bed to crash on- which was comfortable. But the room looked old and dirty.",

But, price does not equal value. The outdoor pool and shuttle service are shared with the hotel next door, which isn't made clear in the listing. More than once, the shuttle stopped and waited for people to get on next door and proceeded to either drive off immediately without stopping or was too full to carry the passengers waiting here. When you're in DC, expect to wait -- that's just how things work here. (TIP for the hotel: Arlington Cemetery's gravesite shuttle has a direct phone, instead of a two-way radio.) Our housekeeper was good, but there was a roach in our room. Nice bedding and towels. The bed was uncomfortable, but there were signs posted that said that the hotel was beginning a remodel. The hot breakfast was meh, and the breakfast area was very small for the size of the hotel. Most of the staff at this hotel speaks a language other than English as a first language -- can be problematic if you are calling for the shuttle and can't understand what they are saying. This hotel is definitely not in the easy-off, easy-on category. The hotel is located in an extra-confusing maze of roads. Getting to the hotel from the interstate isn't too bad, but getting back to the interstate and finding restaurants nearby is rather difficult. We'll find somewhere else next time.",

There is a large mall right across the street. There are several strip malls within less than a mile from the hotel. The rooms are clean. Room service is ver good. Breakfast was very good including typical food options which ou would expect from a hotel breakfast. There is free wi-fi but it was rather slow. I would recommend this hotel.",

There were visible drywall repairs throughout the facility. We also had a tough time programming the television to work but finally got it working. Breakfast provided many offerings and the dining room was packed. We went down at 9am, thinking we would miss the early rush and found that we were in the midst of the rush and could not find a place to sit. The employees were very friendly - both at check in and check out. I am not a fan of the chlorine smell with indoor pools but there were many families taking advantage and it was in use every time we passed by.",
