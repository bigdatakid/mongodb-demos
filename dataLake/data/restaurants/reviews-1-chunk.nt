Today, the national franchise, with its familiar red-and-yellow sign, still stands for dependable rooms at wallet-friendly prices. A staple for road-tripping families, truck drivers and tour groups, the motel offers complimentary morning coffee and continental breakfasts. Another perk for travelers: Super 8 travel cups may be refilled for free at any of the motel's locations.",
