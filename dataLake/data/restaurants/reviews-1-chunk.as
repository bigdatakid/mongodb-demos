To make thing even worse, I went out to dinner with my girl and than came back to the same sheet they had the night before. They basically put a clean sheet on top of the dirty sheet. I didn't notice it until I pull the white sheet to check the bed. They didn't change our pillow sheet at all. I wouldn't get mad if it was a cheap hotel. I paid 125 dollar a night for that room and they have the audacity to not change my bed sheet. I was so embarrass for bringing my girl to this hotel. The picture look good online, but when you get to the hotel, it's a different ball game. The room is not that large, compare to the picture. They didn't even have a microwave in the room. I once pay 55 dollar for a hotel room that gave me everything I wanted in orlando, a king size bed and clean sheet. I wish I could get my money back. NOT HAPPY",

I paid under 100 for the night and it was an awesome deal. It's is about 15 minutes from the City Walk where you can shop and eat. The hotel shuttle takes you to and from the airport and City Walk for free. However, it does not take you to the beach. You will need to take a taxi there. Other than that, I have no complaints on my stay. I highly recommend this hotel.",

I was barely impressed with this hotel, being a large name brand, I expected more. The room was centrally located near the airport and highways which was great, thankfully we decided to rent a car because there was no scenery or activities to do near the hotel. The outside and lobby was pretty, very similar to other business hotels. I was extremely dissapointed upon check in when we realized the hotel pool was not only not in service, but it was completely empty. That was the only reason we booked this hotel was for the pool so again we had to drive to even swim on our family vacation. The room was mediocre, similar to a stay at our local hotels in the north east. The breakfast was over priced 15 per person for a breakfast buffet. Overall I would suggest not staying here while on vacation unless you are fully aware in order to do anything fun you must drive there. Also be sure to call before you check in to be sure the pool is in service. For the amount that was spend which was almost 150 per night I think we could have found a better place for our first family trip with our daughter. Good luck hope this helps.",

The hotel was clean and comfortable, but if your neighbor snores or falls asleep with the TV on then I hope you brought sleeping pills. This was really unfortunate, we normally really enjoy doubletree hotels, but we cannot recommend this stop.",
