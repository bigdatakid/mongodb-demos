The breakfast is very poor in the scope and in quality. One day old and hard bread, another day the broken coffee machine. Lot of times empty plates in the buffet have been refilled not till we asked to do so. But the worse is that now there are cats allways in the breakfast room. I really like cats and they are sweet but when guests first touch them and later e.g. the bread of the buffet that is far away from simple hygienic roules. Other guests (e.g. with allergy) will be amused very much.",

WELL A MINOR HICCUP, THE PARKING WAS NOT THAT GOOD, THERE WERE SPACES BUT VERY TIGHT FOR PARKING AND GETTING IN OUT OF THE BUILDING. OTHERWISE NOTHING ELSE WAS WRONG. VALENTINA MOIRA WERE EXCEPTIONAL RECEPTIONISTS WITH HUGE SMILES THAT WOULD HELP YOU IN ANYWAY. THE ROOM WE HAD WAS ROOMY, BATHROOM WAS GOOD SIZE AND WE HAD A BALCONY WITH A BARBECUE IN A QUIET PART OF THE BUILDING. THE BREAKFAST WAS LOVELY AS WAS THE SERVER BUT COULD NOT THINK OF HER NAME. LOCATION WISE WAS FINE, NOTHING REALLY IN WALKING DISTANCE BUT WAS ABOUT 15 MINUTE DRIVE TO DOWNTOWN. THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE WAS MADE SO MUCH NICER WITH VALENTINA MOIRA AND WOULD DEFINITELY STAY THERE AGAIN. THEY ALSO HAD ANOTHER BB WHICH IS SITUATED IN TAORMINA AND WAS THEIR FIRST PROPERTY AND WOULD LOVE TO STAY THERE AS TAORMINA WAS OUR FAVOURITE PART OF SICILY.",
