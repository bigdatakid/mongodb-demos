We had just gotten off our cruise ship and need to check in early but our room wasn't ready. The staff took our bags and stored it until our room was available. We got a standard room and it was extremely spacious and felt more like a suite than a standard room. The hotel was close to the party area but we didn't hear any noise in our rooms. The pool was amazing. We didn't have time to go to the beach. We were easily in walking distance to a lot of restaurants and shopping. I highly recommend this place if you need a place to stay while you wait to go home or to your cruise....I don't recommend driving. Get an Uber or taxi, it makes things easier. The only complaint I would have would be that the sheets were a bit scratchy but if that's the only complaint, then we had a great vacation!",

The only minor faults were that for some reason the A/C in the upstairs halls were ridiculously low it was too cold in the halls. So made going outside seem hotter than it really was. Our room, 303 had patio doors that did not open, this was a shame as this would have made the room much better. Even if there was no access to the patio the open doors would be good. There was a window that opened to the street in the bedroom and we sat there people watching often. The bar closed at 8pm this was a great disappointment so we spent our cash elsewhere. Overall a good Hotel for the price. Great caf / bar on the opposite corner for breakfast / drinks",
