    "reviewText": "We stayed here for the Carrie Underwood concert in Hampton, VA and we were pretty disappointed by this hotel. When we first walked into our room there was a weird mildew type smell in the room and the towels in the bathroom smelled the same way. We had to open the sliding door to let some fresh air into the room. The pictures for this hotel look much nicer than the actual rooms, our bathroom had very little space and the countertop near the sink had a large crack. We had to kill a couple of bugs during our two night stay and the overpriced Coke machine outside of the room had expired drinks. The last morning of our trip the toilet stopped flushing and that was kind of the last straw with this hotel, we were glad to be checking out and we would not recommend staying here. We did make management at the front desk aware of our experience and they gave us a free Coke and a membership to their rewards program with around 10,000 points to make up for the issues... the points do not even come close to giving us any rewards through their program. Disappointing stay overall.",

The free breakfast was good with decent choice of food. When we entered we were happy with the room cleanliness. Entered the toilet and we were greeted with the stink emanating from somewhere. Had to keep running the exhaust fan 24hrs to get rid of smell, good thing was, atleast it worked. For the mattresses, one queen mattress was good enough to hold 2 adults without sagging. Other mattress was terrible seems like the coil was damaged. As soon as I sat on the mattress it depressed 3-4 inches. We avoided to use that mattress to avert back pain. We let our 8 yr old sleep in the middle of the mattress to avoid any discomfort. Overall for the price of the room I was expecting atleast basic amenities to be in good condition.",

She told me it would be around 2PM before I could get a room so I ask her would she put me on the top of the list for the first room because i had been traveling all day. the no personality come out again in her and I know we would not get a room early. when I stepped out to the car I told my wife we could forget a early check in and I was right. We set in the lobby in plain view of the front desk watching guest being checked in. Finally after sitting there from 11AM to 1:45PM I stepped back up to the desk and ask why I'm sitting here for about three hours watching people being checked in. she told me it was the type room i was getting. There was another lady there this time listening to what i was saying that i had been sitting here for about three hours. I left and went set back down at 1:55PM. 1:58PM they called me back up there and gave me the keys. She was making me wait to show me she was in control and she cared less about the guest. I have stayed at about 95 of the motels up and down Virginia Beach through out the last ten years this includes the other Holiday Inn with no problems but the check in at the Holiday Inn Express ruin my whole trip.

There seemed to be much nicer hotels and stores about 4-5 blocks up in the 30th Street area but that area is still easy to walk to. The rooms could definitely use an upgrade to decor - they're a bit tacky and older looking however, still clean and the bed was pretty comfortable. Now if you ask my husband, his only concern of the trip would be Nowhere here sells funnel cake! which we thought was very strange, but of course has nothing to do with the hotel itself. Every staff member we encountered was very friendly. The proximity and access to the beach area was great and loved the complimentary breakfast (although I would recommend checking milk labels, I accidentally drank one that was no longer good and spent that day feeling terrible).

Our room was dark and lamps are not bright enough. The shower fixture was broken so shower was either scalding or lukewarm. Drain screen was missing. Mattress was squeaky... More",

    "reviewText": "When I entered the check in desk I noticed how dated the hotel was and it was not very clean. The receptionist told me the room was not ready and she took my phone number and would call when it was ready, we arrived at 2:30pm check in time is 4pm. I never received a call. I returned at 4pm and there was another receptionist who told me he didn't know what happened. We finally checked in and found both locks on our patio door were broken, the drain cover in the bathroom was broke and the cover on the smoke detector broke when the door was closed. Housekeeping didn't come till 2pm the next day to bring fresh towels. We were not satisfied with our stay and expected so much more for the price we paid to stay at this Holiday Inn.",
