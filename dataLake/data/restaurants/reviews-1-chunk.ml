Having said that all the rest was downhill from the cleanliness especially in the kitchen.I can only imagine this was once a pretty recommendable establishment that maybe got overwhelmed with the amount of units to upkeep daily and with kitchenettes in the units comes the constant need to repair the appliances. In our case none of the kitchen appliances worked (fridge, stove, etc.)The location is reliant on a car if you want to see the sites in the city but there are plenty places to eat in the area if you don't mind walking.",

The walk way on the third floor was uneven and hard to walk on while drunk. The coffee was extremely strong in the office. The one thing that worked well was the A/C, it kept the room nice and cool. I read the reviews before booking and thought it couldn't be that bad. Well, it was. Had it not been for a wedding and the party staying there, I would've gone somewhere else. Do yourself a favor and spend a little more money and get a good night sleep in a cleaner hotel.",

How the heck does that work. I asked for a queen bed and said I had two dogs I made sure they knew. When I get there check in is at 4:00 they tell me I have to wait 30 minutes. What have they been doing all day check out is 11. They say oh we didn't see you had dogs and move me to a diffrent room. This is where i get the nasty I cleaned room with two single beds and no toilet seat with filth all over it smelled horrible. I left after being in there for less than 30 minutes. I would rather sleep in my car then be in there a minute longer. I can not believe the filth in that hotel.",

I called the office about the light and they said I would have to wait until the next day in the morning for the maintenance man.  The rooms smell really bad.  There were holes in the walls and carpeting.  Bathroom was dirty.  I do not recommend this hotel to anyone.  Elevator was broken and I had to carry my luggage to the third floor.  Lock on door didn't work.",

With that being said, the place was kind of eerie and the room was dirty. Floors were dirty, shower curtain was full of hair and mildew and room over all had a lingering smoke smell (room was non-smoking). We survived the night but I won't be going back to stay there and unfortunately, I can't say I would recommend this place either.",

The room had an odd smell to it. The carpet was very dirty with stains everywhere, I didn't even want to step on the floor without shoes on. The wasn't connected to the wall and the shower was very dirty. To make it worse the universal tv remote didn't work either. I would have asked for a refund if it wasn't to late. I wanted to sleep in my truck. There are a lot of health and safety issues located on this property.",
