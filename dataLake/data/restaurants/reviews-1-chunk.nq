The wallpaper in the bathroom is peeling so that also does not look good. On the plus side rooms are spacious and staff is very helpfull.",

We were on the first floor near one of the exits so going in and out was easy for us. We were treated by friendly staff who showed me some places that I could take my wife dancing. We had a great weekend and will be definitely staying here again!",
