This is so far below the standards of the DuPont Circle Palomar that I was shocked.  Unfortunately This will probably lead me to not consider other Kimpton hotels I have not seen before I stay at them.  The hotel was way way overpriced for what it is.  The chain needs to fix this one because it brings down the entire Kimpton reputation. They have a great King Street location but that is all.  The hotel did not even offer free newspapers--inexcusable for the price.  I left after one night and  spent the next four nights in a nearby hotel that was everything this one was not--and I paid $100 a night less.  This is a very poor excuse for a boutique hotel.",

Without it's cover, of course, the sleeper is too cold to be comfortable.

The hotel is centrally located in an adorably quaint town close to DC. There is a FREE trolly riding up and down King St every 15-20 min stopping on every 2 blocks for your convience. They are all brick sidewalks so wear walking shoes, not heels....I recommend and would go back",

It's also clean with big mirrors, sufficient lighting and space to feel relax and comfortable. One down side of the room is air conditioner is loud if it's on at night. One small part occur during my stay make this hotel stand out from the others. After the funeral I return to the hotel for a quick change, I was handed with a cool hand towel at the lobby. It was certainly a surprise yet appreciated during that hot afternoon. They also have ice tea available at the lobby and ice popsicle for the kids too. (during certain hour though).

    "reviewText": "The Hotel Monaco was an excellent choice in a superb location. Originally booked our mini vacation for 2 days and extended a day longer. We didn't want to leave!!! The hotel is located right in the middle of Old Town and everything was within walking distance from the hotel. We were also traveling with 2 dogs and had no problems with them during our stay. My only complaint is the lack of grass for the babies to go do their \"business\" in around the hotel. We had to walk a couple blocks up to this one strip of grass for bathroom breaks. There are parks down by the water, but for late nite runs it would've been nice if we could have taken them to the courtyard for a quickie. Maybe they can invest in remodeling it in the future to accommodate their pet friendly status. Overall, it was an excellent stay with beautiful rooms and a very curtious and helpful staff. Highly recommended!",

    "reviewText": "I really enjoyed the location, it was so close to the main street that runs through old town Alexandria. You could walk right out of the hotel and up and down King St to many stores, restaurants, bars, and the water. There was also a fresh farmers market in the town square literally steps from the hotel. I really enjoyed all the fresh produce and baked goods for sale there. The only thing I was unhappy with at the hotel was the parking garage. It is so small and it was packed when we checked in. Once we finally found a spot we chose to not even drive our vehicle as to not have to encounter that stressful dilemma again! Another issue was that the room did not have a microwave. If one stays several nights and has left overs from a restaurant you can not re-heat anything in your room. Plus the room comes with a refrigerator but they pack it with their items they want you to purchase so that was also a hassle I just took theirs own and put mine in until I was about to leave and then restocked it with their items. Other than that I thought the hotel was nice and very conveniently located.",
