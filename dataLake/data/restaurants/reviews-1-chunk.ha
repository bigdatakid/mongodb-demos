    "reviewText": "I asked to be moved to the sister hotel next door called The Westin, as The Arion Hotel needed renovation urgently. The mattress had permanent dents. The bed pillows were all but destroyed. The interior was classic 50's decor which had shown wear and tear and and hadn't been maintained. The guests were very, very old. The hotel felt in desperate need for an over-haul. Even the staff were beyond retirement age. My first impression at check-in was with a cold, disinterest from a young (compared to the other seniors working at the hotel) receptionist who proceeded mechanically and emotinless to check me into my room without hardly any eye to eye contact. Then, when ready to be shown my room after a long and exhausting trip to Athens, was handed my room key and and pointed in the direction of the lift, luggage and all! The Arion Resort and Spa Hotel, is NOT a luxury 5 star hotel in 2015! Maybe it was in 1950",

Furthermore, we arrived a little early and left our bags on the reception for a check in at 3pm where they promised to call us once the room is ready. We never received the call and had to go back to reception to get an update. I am not sure whether the team was short staffed or there were some operational issues but in comparison to the other hotels at the same spec the service has been a lot more alert and helpful. We finally checked in the room- this was 45 min late and it was unfortunate as we had a wedding to go to and it meant that we had a delay. The room had few things missing but it was probably because they did not have enough time to set it up. Apart from the chaotic reception, the hotel and the facilities were beautiful and comfortable. The bar staff was absolutely lovely and very sympathetic and so were the beach staff. Regardless of the reception service, I would go back and it was a beautiful couple of days. I would reccomend the place but just to keep an open mind on the responsiveness of the reception.",

Large and well appointed rooms and helpful staff. A stunning pool and garden area - although weather would not oblige. Would not take kids there (although there were several families on property) and caution those with mobility issues to beware as Villa Carlotta is a good walk uphill from the center of town.

On arrival there were flowers in our room as they had remembered we were in Sicily celebrating our wedding anniversary. Every evening they have canopies on the terrace overlooking stunning views. On our first night the drinks were complimentary. Breakfast was to die for incl the wonderful pastries and cakes, I have never eaten such delicious treats that just melted in your mouth. I couldn't resist. They also have the best freshly squeezed blood red orange juice my absolute favourite. We had room 304 on the very top level with the most stunning views. The outstanding service continued throughout our whole stay, whether it was booking us restaurants, taxis, giving advise on things to do, making sure we had towels when visiting the beach, recommending specific specialist shops when we showed interest in items we wanted to buy. Natalie and Olga day or night always took time to ask us how our day went and what our plans were and genuinely seemed interested in talking to us. We were not just guests we felt like friends. We will miss this place, villa Carlotta is very special and will be a very hard act to follow. Thank you again for giving us the best memories ever.",

    "reviewTitle": "Fabulous hotel in a fabulous location",
    "reviewText": "Loved this hotel from the complementary glass of prosecco on arrival to the loading the car on departure. Simona and all the staff were attentive without being in your face for the duration of our (far too short) stay. This is a hotel that would be sad to miss out on. With an easy walk to the buzzing centre of Taormina yet quiet and relaxed with views to die for if 'chilling by the pool ' is your thing. A smoking Mount Etna as a backdrop ( with glowing lava if you are lucky) is spectacular and although this shows the power of mother nature , there is a sense of serenity and safety",
