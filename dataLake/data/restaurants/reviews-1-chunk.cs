After returning to our room we received a call saying one was avail and we could move rooms immediately. Since this was first thing in the morning it tells me that this room was avail when we checked in. If you want a quiet hotel, DON'T stay here. When a door from a room closes or when someone walks heavy in the hall or in their room, the entire building shakes it can be heard loudly in the room next door below. There was a baseball team with kids that appeared to be 10 yrs old staying here and running wild. The noise and floor/building rattling from a baseball team running up and down the hallways was very disturbing. The parents not once told the kids to stop running. It was really sad the lack of respect being shown to other guests. We talked to the front desk and they told us that it is not their place to say anything to the kids. Yes it is!! It is up to you to ensure the comfort of all your guests and if kids are being too loud and parents aren't around, you can tell the kids to stop running in the halls and to be quiet. The hotel was loud, beds pillows were uncomfortable, the breakfast was less than average. Will we stay at a Mirazur Plus again, yes. Will we stay at this location,NEVER!",

The bed was standard which for us wasn't very comfortable. They offered a free breakfast with eggs, sausage, waffles and for two days they had potatoes but didn't on the last day. They also had the standard cereal, yogurt, etc. The hotel is right next to a Jack in The Box and across the highway from and IHOP. Overall it was a nice standard hotel.",
