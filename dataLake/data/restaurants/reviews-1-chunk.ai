Even after they bragged about just hiring a new Hilton chef, the breakfast was the same crap as before so I wasn't about to try dinner. The elevator is a tragedy in the making. The A/C in my room broke and fortunately they had another room for me. Two other families in our party had booked the bungalows on the property and on their second day they were told they had to move into the hotel as the parking area in front of the bungalows was going to be paved. Apparently the hotel knew this was scheduled yet they moved them in anyhow and made them spend nearly a whole day of valuable vacation time moving. I suggest you spend a few more dollars and book the Marriott beach resort on rice street in Lihue, that IS a resort and has fabulous restaurants close by.",

We explained the situation and he brought us water. Luckily our friends returned shortly after and were able to get us lunch and drinks on their room. We went back to check in three hours later and were told we didn't have a room in the same building. Forty-five minutes later they are promising to make it right and our going to put us in a room so we can make our dinner reservations off site. When we checked in later, we were told that we could move for a thousand for 4 nights. Needless to say they didn't make it right. I heard several people at the pool say they had similar situations with check in. Seemed to be scam. Be prepared to have every meal at the Bistro interrupted by a woman trying to sell spa packages. Also, when the server at the pool lost my ticket he called my room and yelled at me that I took it. I explained I didn't, but still feeling bad walked back to the Sky Pool and asked him and he said he did have it and did not even apologize for yelling at me.",

While they do run the system well you still spend a lot of time waiting and riding or walking long distances. Room was nice they did up grade us to a nicer view on request, as the first ocean view was obstructed. Food was ok for the most part, first night buffet area was being remodeled so the available area was small and food choices minimal. Theme nights were good however seafood night lacked seafood. Other than fish you had to search for other seafood in rice, pasta or stew. Final downgrade was based on misinformation, after attending the two hour sales session we were given resort credit, some things were listed as not included golf, prepaid services, and boutique. We decided to use our credit to spread the wealth to the staff in gratuities. Upon check out we were then told gratuities were not included and we were now responsible for the amount accrued. It wasn't about the money more the deception I felt that was portrayed.",

Since the grounds are built on a hill, getting around is not easy and requires cart service to get around. Sometimes the wait was longer than expected for a cart to come by. We would have walked but the paths were not built for pedestrian use and could be dangerous. Food is very expensive, glad we opted for the all inclusive option. The high end restaurant LaFrida was well worth the extra 30 per person. If you don't mind wasting 3 hours, go on the time share presentation to get resort credit. We got 400 dollars which we used on two massages and the high end restaurant. Just keep in mind that they will tell you it is only 90 minutes long... which it wasn't. Don't feel bad about saying no to those salespeople. They are slimy like used car salesmen. Pay close attention to the bill when you check out, we had an issue with a very large extra charge that we found. It is unfortunate that they did not catch it first, and I didn't have to warn you. Do not do any of the buffets at La Nao, almost all the food is room temperature. There is food and drink service at the pools, but all the waiters moved at a much slower pace, and preferred to talk with each other than serve guests. Now besides the items I mentioned, it really was a nice place overall, and worth the money we paid. Probably will not return but onl",

I finally sat through the presentation to get the hotel credits and it took 2-1/2 hours (they said it would take 90 minutes). They started off with a soft-sell which I declined. Then the manager comes over with a harder sell (I said no again), then they transferred me to a gentleman who was to finalize the credits and he was so aggressive that I had to tell him very firmly that I was NOT interested and that he was making me feel uncomfortable. Then HIS manager came over and he was so rude. I was really upset after that. So, while I loved the property, I will NEVER go back because of that.",

This is a big big resort and yes size does matter. When I first heard this resort is huge and some people were complaining about it. I was wondering how being so big can be a bad thing. Well, its not bad but it is not so good either for a family. If I were in my 20's, I would have absolutely love this huge resort. You can either jump on a golf cart or just jump, run and walk from one building to other. It would give me an opportunity to digest all the all inclusive foods also. But when you have a four month old infant with you, this might not be that good. Carrying the infant in your lap and making sure neither your infant nor his stroller falls of the cart when golf carts are moving fast through the hill could be a challenge. There is no way you can park your car next to your building. You have to self park or valet park close to lobby area and than take a golf cart to go to your room. Now if you are either on third floor or first floor you have to take the stairs to go to your room. None of this matter if your are young or energetic, it is rather fun. But with family, specially with an infant fun could become a challenge easily.",

    "reviewText": "Disappointing for the following reasons: 1. Expedia lists gratuities as included in the package, however we received an itemized bill after every meal which included a tip line. It became clear that servers expected tips from the all-inclusive customers as well. When we asked the front desk and time-share sales staff, we received different answers. The most common being that gratuities are included, but if you receive exceptional service you should feel free to tip your waiter above and beyond the included portion. We were finally told that 5 of our all-inclusive fee was split amongst all the staff, and the waiters only earn 75 pesos a day in wages. Therefore, they count on tips as part of their wages, and apparently the 5 doesn't really do the trick. Not wanting to rip off the staff, I gave additional tips. If I had started my vacation expecting to tip, I would have enjoyed my first few days much more than I did. The disconnect between my expectations and reality were a cause of tension, not only for me, but for other customers that I spoke to as well. 2. When we arrived they didn't have our junior suite ready, so they put us in another room which didn't have a safe, had a leak and puddle in the hallway outside the room, didn't have a working microwave, and took 5 minutes for the hot water in the shower to heat up. 3. The beach is not safe or open to swimming. 4. Two of the restaurants were up-sells, about 30 per head, and only 4 wines included in the pkg.",

So no long walk after dinner with the stroller to calm down baby. Our building also had a hot water problem, and they started digging a huge whole right in front of it (making sure the shuttles couldn't drive to our building). We spent 4 days without hot water, taking cold showers and boiling water on the stove top to give baby a bath. Ridiculous. The hotel didn't offer any compensation, discount or new room.

Timeshares agents are roaming all around in the hotel and won't even allow you to eat in restaurants (as they keep disturbing you almost every time).. As soon as you land to hotel, everyone comes to you with their pitches to join a breakfast tour(Timeshare meeting).. 4. Room is not quite as you can hear golf cart roaming in middle of night, hard to sleep ... 5. All Inclusive is a scam as they don't have good vegan food (Hardly any dishes in any restaurant( they can international cuisines) nor all good liquors are charged outside of your all inclusive plan).

Guests are not snooty. No parties going on here, which is for other resorts, so there is a resort where peace and quiet for the most part exists, thank god! Watch out for the golf carts, they tend to be in a race to get somewhere fast.",

    "reviewText": "Upon checking in, myself being an Expedia Gold member and this being a +VIP hotel, I was promised a free upgrade as well as Spa Credits from the Expedia Customer service reps. I've used these perks at numerous +VIP hotels in the past without any problems at all but the manager at this hotel refused to honor anything and gave me and my whole family a hard time. I accepted his horrible attitude and moved on because I did not have a choice since everything was prepaid. Note** Expedia gave me credits after my trip was completed to make up for this and they hadn't had the slightest clue as to why we were treated so badly. Pools were nice and the food was pretty good. Room service is the biggest joke I've ever seen in my life. I called for food one night and it came 2 hours later. Another time I requested a rollaway bed and it came 4 hours later after numerous phone calls and complaining. last night there I called for some liquor because this seems to be the only hotel without any liquor stocked in the room and they said they could only give me 2 beers per person. I said fine and after 4 calls over 2 more hours, the beer finally arrives hot like lava and I was so frustrated with the staff it made me sick. They have this one lady who answers the phones after 9PM and she seriously must have been hating her job because she sounded like the mafia to me and hung up on me. I truly hated this experience and will never ever ever go here again (obviously) and I highly recommend noone else 2",

The food was delicious, and the Asian Restaurant was absolutely phenomenal (we had a group of 10). Our waiter (Gerardo) was amazing! This resort is definitely worth every penny!",
