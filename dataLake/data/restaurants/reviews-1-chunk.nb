    "reviewText": "For this establishment to give the name of FIesta Inn and Suites is a bad form of advertisement. The ONLY association they have with the Theme park is that it is not that far from there... Also in my opinion any 4-5 star reviews this hotel gets I believe were posted by staff/owner! Two words for this place is Gross! Gross! This hotel well if what we had was a suite then....I just don't have words because 2 weeks later and I am still stunned and finding it hard to believe I stayed there 1 night. Breakfast made me ill to my stomach. I did not feel like I was in clean hotel when it came to the room. The appliances in suite were from 1960 and fridge was leaking water from icebox. Stove was well not sure what it aspired to be but i would not cook anything on it or in it. Plugs did not work through out and no AC in room...it is is living area so to get this AC air you have to sleep with door open. The bathrooms although for most part clean the tub was dingy, the sheets appear decades old (along with lumpy mattresses, flat pillows and decore from the 60's). This establishment is great for a budget minded person but I predict foul practices from not so savory citizens happen here (as evidenced by our room door having been kicked in on numerous occassions-it was hard to open and when you did get it open the door at bottom where frame and door meet was split). I was this close to sleeping in my car with my family instead. Never will I stay here again. Nice staff but not nice hotel!",
