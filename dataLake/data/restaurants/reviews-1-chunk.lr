Then we get to the room and it seemed everything was okay, but on the 2nd day we were there, one of the legs broke on the bed around 4pm while I was taking a nap.  I went to the front desk to inform them about this and asked if they could have maintenance come over to fix it while we would be out till 10 or 11pm.  When we returned the bed was still broke.  I went to the front desk and asked if they would comp the price of the room for the night.  He proceeded to get upset with me and told me to check out and then he would refund the price.  This was all on a very busy weekend in San Antonio, due to high school graduations and there were no rooms available around the area.  Therefore we had to end up sleeping on the pull out sofa.  Very uncomfortable for someone who has had 6 back surgeries.  Stay away from this place, would not recommend it to my worst enemy.  Plus my parents had a room there also and had roaches in their room, DISGUSTING!!!",

Makes u feel uncomfortable and unsafe. I reserved a family room with queen size beds and ended up getting a small room twice as small w 2 twin beds for the same price I wasn't offered a refund of any sort. The management is rude. Then you walk into the rooms, broken beds, non working rusted appliances, tv is nothing but static, the room was not maintained well n to top it off roaches everywhere! We were there for the whole weekend and I asked for extra towels and till today a week later after my trip am still waiting to get my towels. Didn't even bother cleaning the room for us. I can't rate this hotel any lower other wise I would! Stay away ppl worst hotel I've stayed at ever!",
