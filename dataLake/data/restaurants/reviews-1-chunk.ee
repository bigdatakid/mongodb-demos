But hey they supply a robe to make it better :( Leaving the room also allows anyone passing to see straight in to your room and with the bed being right there exposes your partner to 'rubber necking' too. I guess this place suits people looking for a certain old worldliness etc, but for an overnight stop on the way down the coast it is best avoided, we didn't even take our cases up to our room as 1. You have to enter the house from the rear and wind your way through the downstairs rooms to get to the stairs (no lift) 2. There was not enough room in the room for us and our luggage.

    "reviewText": "We stayed at the Simpson House Inn as a special treat for a milestone birthday. From check in to check out it was the best experience we have ever had. We were met on arrival by name and had a lovely room with our own private balcony (the Sun Room). The gardens are just lovely and perfect for relaxing with a book and a glass of wine. The Inn puts on a complimentary wine tasting with canapes, and does a lovely breakfast as well. I cannot recommend this Inn highly enough. Stay here!",

    "reviewText": "We absolutely loved this BB. However, our room (Mary Simpson Room) was tiny and the bathroom was across the hall. If we had known that the room didn't have a bathroom (it wasn't shared, but we did have to leave the room to go to the bathroom, and be in the hallway that everyone on the floor uses, so it was not private-feeling at all), we wouldn't have booked it. I wish we would have known, because we would have chosen a different room. We would go back again, for sure, but stay in a different room. The grounds, house, breakfast, everything was incredibly lovely. An amazing place to stay and an easy walk to everything in Santa Barbara :)",
