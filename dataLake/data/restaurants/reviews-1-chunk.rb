They have a very useful checklist that really helped me as a bride to get organized. The venue is BEAUTIFUL and is perfect if you want a sort of... Read More \"outdoor\" wedding that is temperature controlled. All of our guests swooned over the beauty of the location and how smoothly the night went. Lakeway makes it so easy with the packages they offer. We couldn't have asked for a more perfect place to have our wedding!",

    "reviewText": "We really enjoyed our stay at the resort but it seems as though the mgmt. needs to look a bit closer at a few things. The golf carts should be used to shuttle people (especially the elderly) to their parked cars because you can be parked quite a ways from your car and there are some steep hills. The pool area needs to be policed more frequently to clean up towels and trash. The staff was very, very friendly and helpful. Spent both nights enjoying the bar and the bartender.",

    "reviewText": "Most of our 150 guests were from out of town. We desired a venue where they could stay entire weekend. Lakeway Resort and Spa served our needs. The service the entire weekend was excellent. The Vista room overlooking Lake Travis served for the ceremony and reception. Julie Stanfield the coordinator/manager was excellent. Her followup and suggestions were always dead on to our desires. New to the Austin area, we had to depend on her opinion for all. Never did she go wrong. She was on top of every detail. The food was excellent, the service was excellent.....I highly recommend Lakeway Resort and Spa. Everyone was always very professional.",
