The maid service was terrific and the best part for us was the free parking. We used our car a lot!! The 2 biggest negative's were the Wifi. ( it was basically nonexistent) We had to upgrade our plan twice through verizon but ended up with 6 free gigs/mo through a promotion we were told about when we called in route to Yosemite! And the other potential negative was the quality of the windows. There were nights we could hear the wind howling and the noise from the street but I'm not a light sleeper so it didn't bother me. (Just bring ear plugs in case you can't sleep from the outside noise). Oh and if you keep walking up Lombard Street from the hotel (1.5 miles approx.) you'll come across the famous crookedest St on Lombard St. !! It's hilly but worth the challenge! In closing I would stay here again!",

We would definitely recommend this hotel to people that aren't looking to stay in their rooms the whole time. We basically dropped out stuff went and explored the city.
