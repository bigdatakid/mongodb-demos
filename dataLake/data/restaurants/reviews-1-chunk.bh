    "reviewText": "First thing I saw when I walked into my room was that the TV was plugged into an outlet on the other side of the room with an extension cord draped across the middle of the floor. Next, it seems as though the \"maintenance person\" had been trying to snake a clog from the toilet because they left the snake IN the toilet along with a brown sludge.I went and asked for another room. The hotel keys were reprogrammed incorrectly, so I went back AGAIN and had then reprogrammed. The next room looked as though the door had been busted down MULTIPLE times as the lock was barely hanging on to the wood and there were holes in the frame where it looks like it had been kicked down. There were a lot of strange people around who appeared to live there as well. I'm assuming the cockroach on the kitchen counter also lived there.The room had no trash receptacles whatsoever and the heater did not work which made for a rather cold sleep as it was between 40 and 50 degrees out that night. I had 2 nights booked and decided to check out early. I slept on a couch in the airport the next night waiting for my morning flight and was much more comfortable and felt much more safe than I did at this hotel.Absolutely would tell everyone to steer clear of this hotel at ALL costs.",

When i pulled up I was so disappointed. The outside looked like a hotel you rent by the hour. The inside of the room was terrible. Water did not work properly, there were no towels, there were stains on the couch, chair and floor. It was so bad I didn't even let me two year old sit on the furniture. This was supposed to be a non smoking room however it smelled like smoke. There were also cigarette burns on the wall. The shower didn't work and it looked like bed and the frame needed to be replaced. We didn't bother to stay. After 20 minutes we packed our bags and left. The front desk staff said we were unable to get our money back and gave us the run around about the room being used therefore no refund. I even called the owner and Expedia and they both gave me the run around. This place should be shut down. No one should live here. This hotel should not even be listed on Expedia. Again i was in a rush and i didn't read the reviews so it is truly my fault. But a place like this should not be allowed to advertise.",

Not only where they're very small roaches in the bed, but I found some on the walls of the bedroom.  This caused me to get up- leave my keys on the coffee table and go home...... crazy at home is preferable  to crazy at a hotel.  The staff was very nice- extremely  personable and friendly.

Internet was pretty much nonexistence in the room. they kept saying that they have to reboot the router, but after a day of trying, they blamed it on time warner. the internet in the lobby area was great though, but that's not where i want to spend my time working. the pictures on Expedia are probably a few years old. we only used the room as a drop off point for our stuff as we were out most of the time, so if you don't plan on \"staying\" in the hotel, it's ok. still would have liked fresh towels. if i knew i could upload pictures on my review, i would have taken some.",

The blankets had burn holes all in them even though it was a non smoking room. Then there were these weird guys who watched us the whole time we took our stuff into the room and and every time we would leave or come they would be watching us we told the people in the front and they said they had security to watch HA! never saw any security. then one of the men who was 26 yrs old tried talking to my 15 yr old daughter creep! they also kept asking if we wanted to buy drugs and all kinds of stuff it was very scarey!!

The management recommended that my companion and I go to the room first to check if any of the lights were out and to make sure the room is properly furnished before we pay for the room because there is a no refund policy. The first room we went in to check had no lights in the living room, the hair dryer was previous stolen, and the room smells like smoke. This hotel is horrible. The furniture, whatever is left of it is broken, dated, and unclean. The furniture smells, the floors will make your feet BLACK in 5 seconds. The bed is a super hard box spring with the thinnest possible bedding on top. The towels provided were so thin, you'd need two to do the job of one.",

    "reviewText": "First of all, the front desk had a very unkept, shady atmosphere about it.  I could smell cigarette smoke everywhere.  The first room they offered me was one in which the front door did not bolt shut.  The second room, bolted shut, but I was still leary since I could see the drill marks where this door had been repaired several times.  The springs were shot in both beds, and they were not Queen Size as advertised.  I saw a couple of roaches crawling in my kitchen.  This hotel should not be listed in Expedia.  It is a safety and health risk.  The WiFi did not work.",

    "reviewText": "For this establishment to give the name of FIesta Inn and Suites is a bad form of advertisement. The ONLY association they have with the Theme park is that it is not that far from there... Also in my opinion any 4-5 star reviews this hotel gets I believe were posted by staff/owner! Two words for this place is Gross! Gross! This hotel well if what we had was a suite then....I just don't have words because 2 weeks later and I am still stunned and finding it hard to believe I stayed there 1 night. Breakfast made me ill to my stomach. I did not feel like I was in clean hotel when it came to the room. The appliances in suite were from 1960 and fridge was leaking water from icebox. Stove was well not sure what it aspired to be but i would not cook anything on it or in it. Plugs did not work through out and no AC in room...it is is living area so to get this AC air you have to sleep with door open. The bathrooms although for most part clean the tub was dingy, the sheets appear decades old (along with lumpy mattresses, flat pillows and decore from the 60's). This establishment is great for a budget minded person but I predict foul practices from not so savory citizens happen here (as evidenced by our room door having been kicked in on numerous occassions-it was hard to open and when you did get it open the door at bottom where frame and door meet was split). I was this close to sleeping in my car with my family instead. Never will I stay here again. Nice staff but not nice hotel!",
