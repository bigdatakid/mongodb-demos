Got up early, turned in our key and went to McDonalds to wash up and eat breakfast. Worst experience i have had with a hotel!!!  I regret Not  remembering to take pictures of the room to share with others.",

The room was filthy, cockroaches everywhere, the furniture looked worse than garbage picked up off the street. I am not kidding, every room was worse than the next, not what the picture shows.The service was even worse, no towels, no soap, no trash cans, my bed was literally broken in half, not one time in the 4 days did anyone come to clean my room.",

The bad never had towels the whole time we were there, the pool had alot of clorine and was still dirty along with the poolside it was covered in cigerette butts and bird poop. The room wasnt much better we found ourselves in a room when the ac worked periodically, the shower curtain was falling off, and there was a smell of smoke in a non-smoking room. The staff was great anytime I spoke with them they tried to take care of any need I may have had. We arrived on a Friday which is the day they have happy hour and they serve you drinks and food free of expense and added this time was live entertainment. We didnt spend alot of time at the hotel but if your looking for a place to rest your head thats in a great location I would recommend this place.",
