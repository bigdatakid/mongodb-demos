However, this year, the hotel offered a slightly lower nightly rate and I thought I'd give it a try. This is not a high-end hotel, but delivers good quality for the cost. The hotel itself was well-maintained, clean and well-lit. The reception desk was attended around the clock, and the receptionists I interacted with were all pleasant. The room was sufficient for my needs, with the furnishings you would expect. Free Wi-Fi, and a small fridge made my stay more pleasant. The hotel is located close to the Interstate, with lots of restaurants, gas stations and retail nearby. I had plenty of dining options within easy walking distance. The parking lot struck me as small, but the hotel was not fully booked. I never had trouble finding a nearby spot. The only inconvenience I noticed was that power outlets were few, and generally not located conveniently. This would not have been a problem a few years ago, but now that many of us travel with phones, tablets and assorted devices, the hotel would do well to make it easier for visitors to recharge their toys. All in all, I would happily stay here again on a future visit.",

I didn't sleep well, but I blame myself for not bringing my own pillow. I can't sleep without a pillow, but I need it to be pretty flat, which hotel pillows are notoriously fluffy. My husband didn't sleep well because of the air conditioner. It was incredibly loud, which we both liked, because it drowned out the other noises in the hotel. Unfortunately, whenever the AC shut off, it was jarring and woke him up repeatedly. My only other complaints would be the room doors, which slam no matter how you shut them and the breakfast buffet, which is a healthy eaters worst nightmare (unless you can be sustained on mealy apples alone).

Maybe a week-long hold of 150 of the nightly room rate is standard for most hotels, and I've just never noticed before, but budget-conscious visitors might want to be aware of this. I was also charged a 10 pet fee, which wasn't advertised here, but that wasn't a huge deal. (The hold, by the way, was NOT pet-related, it was a general damage deposit that they charge to ALL guests.)",

At least we had entertainment for the evening.",
