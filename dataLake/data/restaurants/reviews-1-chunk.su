    "reviewText": "Great place to stay if you're planning on venturing out and seeing more of Austin. We had no desire to hang out in just one spot (ie, downtown) and didn't have a problem with staying at a hotel a little further away from the traditional Austin nightlife, so that we were a short drive away from everything. The hotel was a little hidden behind a Bone Daddy's, but still in a safe part of town. Would totally come back here again!",

    "reviewText": "I found the Hilton Garden Inn to be quite pleasant despite it's location along a very busy Hwy 183 corridor. The room was clean and comfortable. The staff was friendly. The WiFi worked great. There was some renovations going on during our stay, but it did not hinder us moving about the hotel. My only comment is that the windows weren't very soundproof so we did have some highway noise make its way into our room, but it wasn't detrimental so as to impact our stay.",

There is a decent BBQ restaurant with a OK beer selection in the parking lot of the hotel, which is good when you don't want to drive. The hotel restaurant staff need some hospitality training, I walked up and were passed by two employees. Granted they appeared to be in the middle of an issue, but they could at least said hi and that they would be with me in a minute. Instead they glanced and moved on without a word so I decided to give my business to the BBQ place. Might stay here next time, but might also stay at another hotel in the area.",
