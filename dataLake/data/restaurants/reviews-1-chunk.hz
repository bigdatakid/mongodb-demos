Very easy to walk for anything you need. Out for a snack or a meal, coffee or bagels, a walk down to the waterfront, a drugstore. And with the King Street Trolley you can easily get to the Metro. The room was spacious and very clean and comfortable and while youwere aware that is is an old building it was hid very well.The lobby and was open and welcoming but in the end the presentation and feel of the \"boutique hotel\" was not for us. There seemed to be a little something that rubbed me the wrong way about things. From the check in where we were told and extra $50 a night would be charged to our credit card for incidentals and would be refunded if we didn't use it. To the \"doormen\" that held open the door and kept talking to each other as you walked thru. Then there was the shuttle to the airport that didn't start to 7AM so was no use to us. The free wi-fi that you had to sign up as a loyalty member to use (on the longest form I have ever seen) To the dogs barking in the lobby. I like dogs but while a crying baby in a motel is horror story often told we all know the parents are doing what they can but a dog left barking in a room is just rude not cute at all.",

I found it insulting after paying this kind of money for a room, when almost any of the 'lesser' chains would provide it for free. Fortunately there are cafes nearby if you don't have a data plan and need to check a flight.

I opted for this hotel over the conference hotel because I wanted to stay in an area where I would have more options for meals, shopping, and site seeing. I was very happy with my choice! The location was great for exploring Old Town Alexandria, and for accessing the Mount Vernon Trail for running and biking. My room was very comfortable and included many thoughtful details - plush bathrobe, yoga mat, minibar with a variety of snacks, lots of regular and USB outlets, free wifi. The hotel was in great shape, and I appreciated the free coffee service in the morning and wine happy hour in the afternoon. I was delighted to discover that the hotel has bikes that are free for guests' use - I wish I had been able to use them more than once! My room service breakfast was pricey but delicious and arrived exactly when ordered. And I was delighted to receive a surprise from the hotel one afternoon - a bottle of wine and a plate of snacks! My only complaint about my stay was the noise from a neighboring room's TV late one night, and this was immediately resolved by a quick call to the front desk. I had heard only good things about Kimpton hotels prior to my stay, and now I understand why.",

The staff were incredibly helpful...I was able to check in early, I ran out of toothpaste and they were nice enough to run some up to my room for me in a matter of minutes. The very best thing about the Hotel Monaco was the location, location, location!! It is centered right in hub of all the action in beautiful Old Town Alexandria. It was perfect and I would definately stay there again!!",

We were on the quiet back of the hotel, although we could slightly hear weddings taking place in the courtyard below. a second upholstered chair (there was one plus a desk chair), would have been nice. The room was quite clean. Service was helpful and unobtrusive. You can save on parking if you park under the building across the street to the north instead of using the valet.",

When I spoke with the front desk they said that it was 'just the way it works'. Absolutely horrible. The front desk assigned another couple to the room we were staying in so me and my husband were in bed when additional guests barged in our room, using keys that they got from the front desk! The room looks nothing like it does in the pictures. I understand marketing strategies but it was a far stretch from what they'd have you believe online. Do not stay here! The hotel staff are awful and inconsistent, the room is not the same as advertised, and you'll be charged an arm and a leg in additional fees.",

Had to find all this out from another guest while in the elevator. Otherwise, the staff was very nice and accommodating. Rooms are beautifully appointed, but the mattresses are very firm - my preference is for a softer mattress.",

    "reviewTitle": "Real Service Problems",
    "reviewText": "Main problem was with air conditioning in the room and the hotel's failure to address the situation properly. When room temp reached 74 degrees (set on 68) I called the front desk. We were assured an engineer would be up immediately. 20 minutes later--I called again. Front desk had no record of the first call. By now the room temp was 82 degrees. The front desk assured us the problem would be dealt with. We left for the day and returned 7 pm. The a/c was STILL not repaired and the front desk had no progress report for us, no update, nothing. Our impression was that maybe they were hoping we wouldn't bring up the issue again. We asked for an immediate move to another room and were moved within 20 minutes.Second, smaller issue: we were in town to attend a funeral at Arlington Cemetery. The night before, my son needed his shoes shined. We called the front desk and were told to put the shoes outside our door, and they would be ready in the morning. Next morning: shoes had not been touched. When I complained to the front desk, I was told: \"Why didn't you bring them down to the desk? That's what you should have done.\"Bottom line: this is a nicely redecorated hotel in a prime Old Town Alexandria location, but I won't be staying there again.",

    "reviewText": "Pet friendly is one thing. But there were entirely too many large dogs - in the lobby, at the happy hour and in the elevators. If you have allergies, like we do, this is a major problem that we were not prepared for. Our room was pet free, but dogs were on the furniture in the lobby and shaking their dander in all the public spaces. The elevators had slobber smell. There has to be a better way to accommodate pet lovers and those who are not. Disappointed for sure - we were there for a wedding.",

The menu lacked variety and was over priced in comparison to the other restaurants one block down. We would return in a heatbeat!",
