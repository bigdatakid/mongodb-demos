    "reviewText": "My wife and I are frequent visitors to the Disney parks and have stayed at 9 different hotels in the neighborhood, varying from 3 1/2 star hotels across the street to 2 star hotels a good distance away. Overall, this hotel is our absolute favorite place to be when we visit Disney. It is a slightly longer walk (20-25 minutes) than most people would like, but the value added here is definitely worth an extra ten minutes of walking. First, the service here is wonderful. The front desk is always very helpful and willing to accommodate requests. They also have free parking and free breakfast, and the breakfast actually has options and enough food to cover an entire meal. It is not a grab and go style to gives you a mini muffin and cup of coffee, but actually allows you and your family a free meal that also helps with budgeting trips. Also, we have always enjoyed the rooms and never had an issue with cleanliness. The beds are comfy and the in-room mini fridge and coffee makers are great. It is a little noisy, but simply leaving the fan on gives enough white noise to be able to sleep. To anyone looking for a budget friendly option that is still close enough to the parks that you can walk every day, this is definitely worth checking out!",

May be their activity calendar wasn't quite best, but they had an outdoor pool. I thought the main draw back was the room plans. They weren't quite as good. I don't really like the fact that even the one-bedroom model, they had very little extra storage and all the bedroom had regular size closet which wasnt very big.

The facility provided assistance for residents needing it as well as more private setups for residents that needed less help. The apartment setup offered residents the opportunity to maintain a private lifestyle that did not confine them to a hospital room- it felt more like home. The staff was always friendly and upbeat, whether they were greeting you at the door or helping a resident. The facility often provided activities and social opportunities for residents to listen to music, hear stories, go shopping, and participate in performances and religious programs. There was also a pool for residents to exercise and get outside. I felt safe with my elderly relative here as the staff could provide medical help which was needed for her a few times. We felt assured she had opportunities to stay busy and active while still taken care of while in her more fragile state.",
