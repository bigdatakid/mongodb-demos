We fully enjoyed the concert. The staff at the IP are very friendly and we did not find anyone that was not. We did not like the Hotel Room as it was probably the worst Casino Hotel room I have ever stayed in. The entire place especially in the Ho... view moretel rooms has a musky smell. It could be a smoke smell but we had a Non smoking room. Casino was fine but I will never stay at this Hotel again as for the smell and the actual rooms were much less than desirable. Nice friendly place but the Hotel part just sucks. Go here and Enjoy but I seriously recommend staying somewhere else.",
