    "reviewText": "I really do not like to give a bad review, but in this case I feel it is warranted, unfortunately. Firstly, the positive, the location is good (although you will hear music late late into the night from nearby bars and street musicians). Their description does not say that they are actually several buildings, so do not be mislead into thinking that you will be staying in the historic pictured hotel. only a few rooms are there. We were off to the rear of the main hotel in a boxed room with NO windows and clearly just a thrown together little square mobile home type structure. The plumbing was very poor, the shower did not drain so you stood in several inches of muggy dirty shower water while showering, the toilet took several attempts to get it to flush . When we first arrived to our room the pillows had no pillow cases. Then next day, the staff didn't even clean our room we came back in the early evening with the bed not changed or made up and all our dirty towels still in the shower where we left them. Its so hot and humid there that we had wanted to return to your room and take a showerbut not poss. I asked to have it cleaned and they said that someone had quit that day so they were understaffed. Not acceptable to me. The next day, after our room was cleaned, we noted they left only one hand towel for us to share. The floor had not been cleaned, there is just wood floor and walking on it bare foot all the little pieces of rocks/dirt from outside were visible and painful.",

    "reviewText": "Hotel is old and is in good condition. Rooms small as was bathroom in lower room. No room for a chair in most rooms if small. Comfortable beds and all new furnishings and bathroom updates, good AC is a must as hot hot hot in summer months. Reception desk on second floor and not handicap accessible if not with folks who can climb the stairs. Day staff helpful with dining in or delivery. taxi service so prompt after called. A room refrigerator would be nice as no continenental breakfast. Most hotels, even small boutique ones offer more than hot beverages and a fruit bowl. toast and bagels or doughnuts with juice or milk would have been an added treat to staying in such a historic home full of nola charm and history. Neighborhood treasure is Frenchmen St (as Bourbon St for the young) and we older folks just want good food and fine jazz. Have to taxi it or walk in heat to catch bus tours as no hotel pick up for just the 2 of us. Staff did book two tours for us and they were fantastic, city/cemetrary and plantation. History is everywhere and so much fun to hear and see all around the area.",

    "reviewText": "The history of this hotel is awesome and was so excited to stay here. However, we were given the one room, outside of the actual hotel (116). The gardens were beautiful and the pool was nicely kept. We really never even felt part of the hotel. We had to walk outside of a locked alley and our room unlocked straight off the street (Kerlerec Street). This room matches none of the pictures advertised on their website. There is not one piece of art on the wall. There was a mirror at one time but it is now leaning against the wall and a hole is displayed where it once hang. The bed was comfortable and the shower was nice. Location was within walking distance to all we wanted to do, but you cannot sleep. Like I said we were right off the street and you can hear every person walking by, at 1am, 2am, 3am...it quieted down by 4am. If you are lucky to get an actual room in the main house, I am sure you will be happy but after paying 280 for a room, I expected a lot more.",

    "reviewText": "We were in town in August. The hotel is at the far end of the French Quarter. The neighborhood is a little more iffy. Not raunchy, but you might feel uncomfortable walking alone back to your hotel if you are late. That said, my husband and I had no trouble. It's a half a block from Frenchmen Street and down the block from the old New Orleans Mint/Museum. And 2 blocks from the trolley into the center of the French Quarter. The hotel is converted from a house built in 1800. Beautifully kept up, the rooms are very nice and the beds very comfortable. Very clean. But not as many places outside of your room to lounge around. But the backyard/pool area is awesome. Wonderful pool secluded in a beautiful garden setting.",
