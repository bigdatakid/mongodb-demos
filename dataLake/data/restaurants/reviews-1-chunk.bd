But I had to write my very first hotel review!!.All 5 of the rooms we went through/viewed in 3 nights smelled BAD, the floors were so dirty and gross I never took my shoes off. The bathrooms were full of mold and filth the tubs look like someone tried to paint them 10 yrs ago and you didn't want to be be barefoot in there believe me.One shower had the on/off valve at the shower head Nicotine stained ceilings/walls with holes in them. Terrrible beds with bed bugs! springs popping out ,comforters with all sort of unknown stains.The last room had the stove removed,leaving the natural gas pipe/valve exposed with no plug on the line allowing anyone to turn it on.That is a very serious Hazard. The kind that LEVELS buildings killing everyone.When I told the desk she said oh thought they plugged those up..Im pretty sure these are rented as apartments during off peak times cheaper.The kind of damage substained to these rooms doesn't come from travelers with their families, there was grease so thick on the range hood and sides of the stoves you could scrape it off.The doors had all been kicked in and broke the trim making the doors barely able to latch",

I went to the front desk to inform them about this and asked if they could have maintenance come over to fix it while we would be out till 10 or 11pm. When we returned the bed was still broke. I went to the front desk and asked if they would comp the price of the room for the night. He proceeded to get upset with me and told me to check out and then he would refund the price. This was all on a very busy weekend in San Antonio, due to high school graduations and there were no rooms available around the area. Therefore we had to end up sleeping on the pull out sofa. Very uncomfortable for someone who has had 6 back surgeries. Stay away from this place, would not recommend it to my worst enemy.

The beds looked like they have not been WASHED in YEARS. It was soo dirty I could not even look at the rest of the room. The smell was out of this world someone should really close them down for good.
