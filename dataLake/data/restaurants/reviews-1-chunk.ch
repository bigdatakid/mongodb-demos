There was nothing wrong with the room, in fact the bed was comfortable, the pillows were great and it was clean everything! It was a great place to crash for the night on our way down to FL. However - the surrounding location was, um, horrible. We didn't sleep well based on the fear of our car getting broken into. Conveniently there is a gas station right across the street so we could fill up and get drinks for the car ride the following day and there were strippers in the gas station maybe off duty for the night Broke a 20 and pretty sure we got wet crumpled stripper money back as change! Gross. We asked about food nearby because all that was close was fast food which we didn't want. We were told to drive down the road 10-15 min and there would be some sit down restaurants. I've never been so happy to see a Longhorn Steakhouse! After what felt like driving through the ghetto it was the place we were stopping without further exploring down the road. The hotel is a little outdated but can't blame them, the location doesn't scream new or getting a lot of people through town much. The breakfast was great though, awesome because we could eat then be on our way. If you plan on checking in late without the need to drive around town then I would recommend it. If you want to stop AND eat dinner, I would say find somewhere better.",
