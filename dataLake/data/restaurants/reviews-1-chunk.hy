The people of Alexandria seem to be quite fond of their dogs as witnessed by the bowls of fresh water put out on the sidewalk by many of the shop owners and even this hotel. The Hotel Monaco is a \"Dog Friendly\" establishment and allows you to bring Fido with on your stay. I must say that when I spotted a hotel guest with her dog in the lobby while we were checking in I got just a little nervous of what we would find when we got to our room; we were very pleased the cleanliness and decor were both wonderful.",

Those poor dogs were barking to death and we asked to be moved. With our luck we were put next door to a room with about 10 people drinking and partying loudly until quite late which prompted us to move again. They put us on the 6th floor in a beat up room with its wallpaper coming off. It was not fully furnished compared to the other 2 rooms we saw previously. It had an ikea plastic chair and only one window the size of a basement window with a broken rolling shade (I wish I could attach the pictures I took). To top it off our room was right across the 3 elevators and their lovely bells that rang all night long. We could not sleep without earplugs. No boutique hotel would have rooms facing the elevators. There usually is a hallway design such as no bedroom door would be 10 feet away from the elevators. This is not a boutique hotel, not even close. More like a bad Holiday Inn.",

We soon realised what was being hidden - paw prints and dog hairs. I have never seen so many dogs in a hotel in my life (some really big ones too). We like dogs and are not afraid of them but didn`t like the idea of sharing a luxury? hotel room with one. It rained heavily when we were there and I am afraid there is no getting away from the smell of wet dog! This is the reason I would not recommend this hotel to some of my friends as they are not dog lovers and would simply have left.

Eco-friendly policy? Our guess is the former.), but the temp was still comfortable, and it is not unheard of for hotel lobbies to be too cold. The in-room A/C unit was a bit noisy, but the kind you can easily tune out. The pool heat wasn't working, which is bad news for an indoor pool. Some of these minor issues may have been overcome by the time you read this, so check with the hotel to see if things are back to working order.

Overlooked the main street that was lit for the Christmas holiday. the beds were comfortable...internet easily available and free...great robes in the room! A Zebra robe and a leopard robe! Check in was easy and the people at the main desk were very helpful. Recommended an amazing French place to eat near by! Probably the best meal I've ever had. The free shuttle to the Metro stops a block away. Walking distance to waterfront art galleries and great eating places. All in all...a really fine few days away.",

    "reviewText": "The Hotel Monaco in Old Town Alexandria is a great hotel.  Very nice. Very Kimpton! A word to the wise.  Do not take a room on the 6th Floor, the top floor of the building.   Due to the buildings architecture (very colonial, very appropriate for Old Town) the rooms on the 6th floor were very small and the ceilings were at an angle with a small dormer window.   I felt a little closed in.  They were very helpful and moved me to a room lower down with a little terrace that opened to the hotel's central courtyard.  Very Nice. Also,  take public transportion or taxi's the valet is a little slow and a little pricey.",

The hotel is only a few blocks from the waterfrtont and King St. is lined with quaint shops.Our only complaints were that hotel staff did not, nor does the hotel's website offer options for parking other than the valet parking offered by the hotel (there were 3 parking garages within 2 blocks of the hotel) and the room temperature seemed warm compared to the temperature set on the thermostat--65. That said, all the staff we encountered were superb.",
