I walked into the bathroom and the smell was worse plus I could see shoe marks on the tile floor. I requested another room and that one was just as bad. The hotel is VERY OLD and I would of went to another hotel but I couldn't get my money back. DONT STAY HERE !!!! The area is not so safe.",

Although there's only 1 washer and 1 dryer you are better off doing your laundry at the hotel. Laundromat facilities in the area are horrible.",
