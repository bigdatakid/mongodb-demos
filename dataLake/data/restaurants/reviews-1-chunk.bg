Only two of the lights worked, there were no trashcans, there was trash underneath of the bed, the bathroom was disgusting, there was a layer of what I'm hoping was just dust covering the entire ceiling, the door did not shut all of the way and it was just above all a ver displeasing experience. The staff was great, like I said, and gave me no issues when I checked out early/cancelled the rest of my reservation. I would never stay here again or reccommend to a friend. The photos online were WAY better than the actual hotel itself.",

The ceiling above the shower looked like it had mold on it from a leak from the bathroom above us. The hair dryer was filthy. We did not sleep well at all the night we stayed.

However, during my sleep, I was caused to awaken very abruptly because I felt something crawling on me. Not only where they're very small roaches in the bed, but I found some on the walls of the bedroom. This caused me to get up- leave my keys on the coffee table and go home...... crazy at home is preferable to crazy at a hotel. The staff was very nice- extremely personable and friendly.

Space was really tight and the whole thing seemed cramped. The description of the hotel claims that a restaurant is located in the building. The menu for it was taped on the door. We were informed that the restaurant had closed. They also claim to offer free wifi, but I was never able to access it. The microwave was broken. The best I can say is that the shower didn't run out of hot water and the AC (only 1 unit, in the 1st bedroom) worked well. Luckily we were worn out and only needed a place to shower \u0026 sleep for 1 night. I cannot imagine staying there any longer than that.",

They said the cutoff time for a full refund was 20 minutes. Or at least that's what they told me three days later. It was Saturday and they told me there wouldn't be a manager until Monday morning (I ended up calling Tuesday at noon, no manager showed up on Monday.)Those two hours were spent unpacking the car, debating whether or not we should leave, and above all, taking pictures of the whole mess.I'll be disputing this with my bank. Meanwhile, never book this hotel. Any of you. Whole place should be closed down and sold to somebody who knows how to run a business.",

They do have a store that seems perfect for incidentals that are forgotten. The staff is friendly but clearly they could use an extra person. The requests I did make for service were delayed because the front desk people were too busy. The hotel is across the street from a discount store and a discount movie theater. It is also not too far from a major mall in San Antonio. These make the location acceptable.",

AC was barely able to cool the room. Room was old and dated. After one night in the room and finding roaches in the kitchen and bedroom I had had enough. I took a shower and I noticed that my feet were leaving dirty footprints in the bathroom floor! I immediately called Expedia and got the room refunded and went somewhere else. AVOID THIS DEAL!",
