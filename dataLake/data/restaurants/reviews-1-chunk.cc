His knowledge will enhance your understanding and appreciation for some of the wonderful things he has collected for everyone's enjoyment. And what a wonderful property - the views, the trees, the animals and birds! We loved sitting outside taking it all in. There is so much to see and do in the surrounding area as well. Patagonia with its railroad history was so quaint and interesting. We loved touring the country side and the wineries. We visited the lake and the nature preserve and spotted some amazing birds we had not seen before. The whole experience was so interesting and relaxing and exceeded our expectations.

We stayed in the Oriental room in the main house. It was a little small but we reserved it because it was the only one available for a one-night stay. It was very comfortable, despite the size, and the food was wonderful. Staff makes breakfast whenever you want, kind of an unusual feature, and one I appreciate because I tend to get up early and don't like to wait til 9 to eat. This is a great Inn for birders, you can see lots of birds without even leaving the patio! It is a couple miles outside of Patagonia, but easy to find.
