The daily wine reception gave us the opportunity to meet other people and other dogs from all over the country. The Old Town location was superb; we were within walking distance of many excellent restaurants and other attractions. The staff was friendly and gracious; they couldn't do enough for us. We felt so much at home at the Monaco, we were reluctant to leave. We definitely would stay at this hotel again and would heartily recommend it to others.",

    "reviewText": "We stayed at the Monaco from 7/5/11 - 7/7/11 and were really pleased. I have stayed at many 5 star hotels and had not-so-great experiences ... this one was a breath of fresh air.From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, everyone was always smiling, pleasant and very helpful. We were checked in very quickly and our room (two double beds) was big, very clean and smelled nice. The bathroom was so sparkling clean that my son (who is very picky) couldn't wait to take a bath (FYI, we are generally shower people.) Yes, the a/c unit can be loud, but when you're tired from a day of sightseeing and full from a big dinner ... all I can say is that I slept very well. I personally would have preferred a firmer mattress but that is really the only complaint I can make. When I realized that I had left my toothbrush and showercap at home, I called the front desk and housekeeping was at my door in 5 minutes with complimentary toiletries. As for Wi-Fi, just sign up on their website to join their club (no charge) and you will get your internet for free. I even read that you can get coupons for some free mini-bar use.My brother and his wife were on the trip with us and their room, with a king bed, was smaller than ours. Being from Europe, they are not fans of a/c to begin with and the loud noise theirs was making made it hard for them to sleep. They finally called guest services to complain because they couldn't turn if off either and were immediately moved to another room (just to sleep in) for the night. The next day while we were out, they had an engineer come in and fix the unit. By the time we came back, it was working fine and there was a bottle of wine waiting for them for their troubles.I did like the decor of the lobby ... colorful and eclectic but in a nice way. The location itself was great because it was so close to great shops and restaurants. There is a french cafe next door which was great for breakfast. We tried dinner at the restaurant downstairs ... although my dinner was good (bucket of fried chicken), my brother felt that the ribs and BBQ chicken were a bit dry. Overall, not worth the money we spent. The wait staff, however, was very efficient and friendly.The next night we tried an Italian restaurant up the street ... Bartucci's. This place was great! Their pastas were homemade and the seafood was fresh and cooked perfectly. Great wine selection also. This place was worth it and we will definitely go back next time we are in town.Overall, I found our stay very satisfying and reasonably priced. Checkout was quick and they even e-mailed me my bill. Based on my experience, I would definitely go back and I would recommend this place without hesitation!",

The staff were all helpful without being gushing and the hotel was well positioned for the excellent restaurants of Old Town Alexandria. If you're a dog lover this is a great place to be - they have doggie happy hours twice a week when our canine chums can bring their owners along for a pre-dinner drink. Old Town Alexandria itself is a friendly place just a few stops on the Metro from National Airport and onwards to DC.

Things that made this more like a 2 star: Cleanliness regardless of how many times I complained was very poor (we found a glass under the bed and it looked like it was there for months); they did not replace essentials such as lotion etc.; and the bed gave me the worst back pain ever!",

Room was a little tight for 4 of us, but it was as big as most hotel rooms would be, nothing more. Shuttle to DCA airport was nice, trolley to Metro was convenient. Unfortunately, trolley doesn't start until 11:30 pm and there is no shuttle to the Metro so we walked a lot more than we expected we would. Overall, we would stay again.",

    "reviewText": "I chose the Hotel Monaco because I've had such wonderful experiences with them in other cities. Moreover, the Expedia rate included transportation to and from the hotel to the airport. I called before embarqing from the west coast to ensure I could be picked up when my flight landed at 10:06 p.m. \"Oh, yes. Just call us.\" The reality was that I was advised the \"last shuttle\" had come and gone and to take a cab. The hotel staff offered a prefuntory \"sorry\" and did nothing else. This was a promise that was not delivered and left me feeling less than happy. DJ",

There was no coffee pot in the room!  No robes! and No Fish!  and No goodies at breakfast buffet!  Just coffee.  No break on the price even though we were the guinea pigs for all the new employees.  Oh sorry we got cookies and milk!Will not stay again!!",
