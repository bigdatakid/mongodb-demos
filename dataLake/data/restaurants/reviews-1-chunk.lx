There was one towel in the bathroom and it was paper thin - I'm so glad we brought our own.The TV didn't work at all, and in the \"living room\" there were cables on the wall where a TV should be. The door wouldn't close unless you channeled your inner Hulk and slam it as hard as you can.The people in the room above us had a very impressive stereo system - we could hear them blasting music all night long. Kids are running around everywhere and there's shouting at night. So if sleeping at night really isn't your thing, this is the place for you.Then there's the roaches. They are everywhere, so if you're afraid of bugs (like me!) avoid this place. Ew. Gross.",

    "reviewText": "We picked this hotel as a last resource on a spontaneous trip we took to SA. We saw the low rating but we decided that for one night it really couldn't be that bad. Boy, were we wrong!! When we booked the hotel it said it was the last one available, meaning that all their other rooms were taken. For a hotel that claims to be at full capacity and thus possibly doing well financially, the quality of their rooms is disgusting. We walked into the room and it instantly smelled of cigarette. Nowhere on our booking did it say this was a smoking room. The bedroom furniture was all written on with permanent marker by someone named Chula, who was asking for money. The smoke detectors were broken and hanging from the wall. Some of the outlets you could tell had burned out because they were brown from the outside (we didn't use them.) The bathroom door had a hole in it, there was no toilet paper, or complimentary  soaps. The shower did not work!! Only the bottom part of the shower worked so you had to kneel inside the tub to get any water. The chairs had the cushions fall out. When we finally when to sleep we almost thought there was bedbugs because we saw all these black spots, it turned out to be cigarette droppings. Like really?! The management needs to get their act together and improve the quality of their rooms if they want to continue business in the future.",
