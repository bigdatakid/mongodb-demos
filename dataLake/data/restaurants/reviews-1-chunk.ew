Huntersville has a very upscale shopping and dining area. The area is excellent with a lot of new business and new construction. The hotel was just right. Refrigerator, microwave, cooking utensils, and everything needed to cook a meal (no oven). Area around the property is very quiet. Hotel staff was friendly and took care of my needs. Free on site laundry was awesome. Fitness equipment not so great, but there are real gyms in the area that offer free 7-day trial passes. I would highly recommend the facility if you are seeking a 2-2.5 star experience.",

Rooms are very spacious w/ full kitchen...oversize bathroom and closet for hang up clothes. Room was extremely clean w/ great flat screen TV and selection of cable TV. Scott, front desk employee, was extremely friendly and definitely wanted to make sure my day, check in process, stay and everything was pleasing. Great young man!

The minute I stepped off the elevator the smoke smell hit me in the face. It was awful and our room smelled so bad that I had to open the window. The room was ok. Bed was uncomfortable and pillows so bad I went and bought one. The laminate floor is dingy and carpet was ok but had some dog hair on it. Being a residence hotel there is no maid service and if you want fresh towels you have to take wet dirty towels to reception and they count them and give you fresh ones. There are free washers and dryers for guests. Hotel is close to I-77. There were people loitering near elevators several times and there was a party I guess on Saturday night. At 2am I could still hear talking and running in the hallway. I would never stay here alone as I didn't really feel safe. Glad I had my husband with me!",

There was no breakfast served because all of the rooms are equipped with a full kitchen and stocked with plates, silverware, etc. There is a mini-market in the lobby where you could purchase items by charging to your room or pay by cash. The room was clean, but smaller than I thought. There isn't a living room area, but one recliner in the corner, so I wouldn't necessarily consider that a suite but it was fine for the amount of time that we spent in the room. Also, our room was on the 1st floor facing the parking lot, so we could not open our curtains to let any light in or else everyone from the parking lot could see into our room. Something to consider when booking a room here. Overall, I would recommend this hotel.",
