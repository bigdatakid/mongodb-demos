We could hear every conversation from the room next to ours. We could hear the upstairs people walking to the bathroom. We could hear the vacuum running across the floor upstairs very loudly. That was such a nice thing to wake up to. We could hear the road noise from the cars on the street. There was nothing comforting about the room, and sleeping through the noise was next to impossible. The one good thing I can say is that the bed itself was comfortable. Parking was cramped. Not worth the 500 it cost for two days. Feeling like I was ripped off.",

Rooms are fine to sleep in, but our kids shower had hair in it and our shower was slow to drain. Beds were fine, and it was just for a night, so, yeah. Nothing awful, but nothing great. Would like to compliment Jigi, the Manager though. She was the best part of the hotel. Extremely friendly and helpful. This hotel is lucky to have her. If you like the motel feel, than you may be happy here. It was a decent price.
