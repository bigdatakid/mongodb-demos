No bar soap or shampoo. Little fridge was half-cold and REEKED of fish. Carpet felt damp. Visible black mold in the box surrounding the a/c unit. Mold around the bathroom 'vent'(which vents nowhere). Pool-deck was vinyl over wood-framing, and was soft and giving way in a couple places. My understanding is these places are individually-owned under one management company, with a HOA. Be advised, it sure seems like a time-share.... only primitive. This facility is at a turning-point: it either needs a massive infusion of cash and renovation, or it needs to 'give way'. My head says demo, my heart says reno.",

We arrived in the area around 9pm and literally saw 10-15 squad cars in a variety of areas, lights flashing, harassing either people walking down the street or people in their vehicles. We actually thought something big had gone down by the sheer number of cops. The next day our family pulled out of the hotel and had driven no more than a mile when a cop stuck his head out of his squad car looking at us, flipped a u-turn and ran a red light at excessive speeds with his lights on to pull us over...for a seatbelt. After receiving the 170 ticket we left the area and went back to Topsail for the day. Absolutely loved the hotel, but probably will avoid the area in the future because of the cops.",

Our room and dresser drawers smelled heavily of mildew. The in room phone did not work and the TV power button didn't work well. The toaster oven had not been cleaned. The main room light would not stay on. The mattress had a huge brown stain covering about a quarter of the bed. As if that all wasn't enough, we woke up to a mouse eating our food! He kept us awake for two nights. The staff did give us another room for a night so they could set up mouse traps. The room that we were moved to was in much better condition. It was also very disappointing when we went to wash our clothes in the laundry room. We opened the door to find a empty room without washing machines. The location is decent with it being about a 5 minute walk to the beach. Very close to restaurants. The back of the building is facing the bay, which was beautiful! Since these are privately owned rooms, renter beware! You may have a great experience or something a little closer to what we experienced.",

    "reviewText": "I have stayed at Palm Suites three times for one or two nights, as the price is quite reasonable for Atlantic Beach and the rooms have been comfortable. Be advised that the units are privately owned, so there can be a considerable difference in their furnishings and amenities. Management provides linen and toiletries service and housekeeping. The first room I had was nicely furnished, including dishes, flatware and kitchen linens. The second room was sparsely, though adequately furnished for a beach stay, but there was no flatware, glasses, nor kitchen linens. We had to take time to go to the supermarket (fortunately nearby) for paper towels and plastic flatware and cups. Neither was there furniture on the balcony. So, the third time, I had presence of mind to ask about amenities. The personnel were wonderfully patient and took the time to verify everything. If you consult the website, you can view photos of the various units. Do choose a sound side unit the town view units overlook the parking lot. Be advised also that the property is not located on the beach and the nearest public beach access is Durham St. (check a map site) and makes the beach a good 5 block walk. This is a perfectly good place to stay for a night or two, but I would not recommend it for an extended beach vacation.",
