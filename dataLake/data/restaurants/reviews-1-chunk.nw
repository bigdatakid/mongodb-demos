More than that, the chef came out, ask and listened to our requests, and came up with a fantastic alternative. The guests were raving about the food - which doesn't always happen at receptions hosted at hotels.We worked with Claudia and she was also great. Responsive. Willing to work with our needs and budget. Professional. The room is beautiful on its own...add some uplighting, flowers or table decor and it's warm and elegant. We were very pleased!",
