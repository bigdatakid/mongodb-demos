The walkways and stairwells to the rooms were littered with garbage on the ground, and dog feces. Waste cans were overfilled and stockpiled with empty beer cartons and bottles on the floor. Dogs and birds hanging out near the waste receptacles taking advantage of any food waste that was discarded and littered throughout the property.",
