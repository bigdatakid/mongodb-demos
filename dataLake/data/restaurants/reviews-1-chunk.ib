On several occasions, there was no one available to open the doors or they were just standing around talking. The first night, we had problems with kids in the swimming pool after midnight making noise and running around. We tried to call downstairs but the room phone didn't work so we had to use our cell phone. After the call was made, the noise stopped after a while. The next morning, the toilet wouldn't flush. We advised the front desk and they fixed the toilet and looked at the room phone. When we mentioned all of this to the person checking us out, they comped us for one night of parking. Honestly, we were expecting more than that, but it was a nice gesture. The room was nice but not very big.",

The manager lied to us saying first they didn't even offer \"queen sized beds\" when we ended up with two doubles instead of the queen and then blamed it was our fault because we booked on Expedia.  We looked on their website and saw they did offer queen beds and have availability at the time and we then ended getting a room with a queen since \"they just has a cancellation\".  Then we ordered room service, waiting an hour, called back and our order was never even put in.  The girl we had ordered with \"left a long time ago\".  We did get a $25 credit to dine at Jackson 20, though.  Their food is good and it is a fun atmosphere.  Honestly, the Kimpton hotels are nice except for the service.  I believe they just have weak management.  We had a brunch for a baptism the same weekend at their other hotel (Morrison) and they were clearly understaffed and disorganized.  It was terribly slow and the manager of the food place only had one person taking care of 16 of us (this was a prearranged private booked brunch).  The food was good but it took 20 mins to get everyone their entree when it was a preset menu of choosing from two items  Definitely not the fault of the poor guy waiting on us but some problem with the kitchen or management.",

There's complimentary wine happy hour with snacks. A gorgeous pool. The list goes on. You owe it to yourself to stay here!",
