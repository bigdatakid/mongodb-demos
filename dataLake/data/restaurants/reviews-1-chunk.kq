Room service is only once a week so you would have to take your used towels to the front desk to get fresh ones.Your feedback is important. Thank you for sharing your experience. We appreciate you letting us know that our cookware policy was an inconvenience, and for that we do apologize. However, we are happy to read you enjoyed the spaciousness of your room, our convenient location near theme parks, and our affordable rates. Once more, thank you for posting your review....",
