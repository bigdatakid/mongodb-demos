    "reviewText": "Did I stay at the same hotel as other reviewers This is not NOT an above average accommodation. I liked the room layout and comfortable bed with good linens and pillows. The buffet breakfast was extensive including fruit, eggs and sausage (as well as the ubiquitous waffle maker) and low-sugar syrup. What was strange was how closely the breakfast bar attendant watched my every move. I think she was trying to be responsive, but she asked me what I was looking for every time I glanced at the selections. The cons for me were the age of the furniture and fixtures and the cleanliness. I have never cited cleanliness in a review-I can let a lot of things pass. But I cannot accept obvious, fresh stains on both the bath vanity and kitchenette counter, especially when they wipe away easily with water, suggesting that not even a rag was dragged across them. The hotel staff was very nice, but always a turn-off for me when they walk in from their cigarette break at the front of the hotel as you walk in behind them. Surprisingly this hotel and the Wingate were nearly equally ranked (and priced) on this site. They are not similar in quality. I checked out the Wingate while in town. It has a much nicer lobby and breakfast room, where a hot breakfast is provided, not a continental as described. The room I was shown had newer furniture, granite kitchenette counter and tile tub/shower surround. Closer to town, it has a few stores within walking distance.",

In the morning I had my heart set on a muffin for breakfast, other than the banana nut and bran that were out, and they searched to no avail. The coffee shop down the road was great (snicker doodle muffin and iced chai, mmmmm)! Location made it easy to get around between Oak Island and Wilmington. Only negative was that the bed was hard.

And after being made aware we were still charged full price for our room with nothing more than a oh - sorry about that.

I booked through Hotels.com and had a charge from them for the room payment, so I was not sure what the charge was for. I immediately called the hotel and sent emails, only to be told that this fee was something I would need to contact the third-party booking site for (it wasn't.) After numerous attempts, I was finally able to get someone to tell me that I smoked in the room (I didn't.) I had to call back three times to speak with a manager, and after being passed to her voicemail time and time again, I eventually told the staff that I was going to stay on the phone until they got me through to a manger on duty. The manager argued with me regarding the claim of smoking in the room (they provided no pictures to me) and tried to ask me to meet her halfway (pay 125 for something I didn't do) before eventually refunding me the fee. I was never notified that I was charged this fee by the hotel (apparently because I booked through a third-party site, but most hotels take your email and contact information when you stay.) Be careful if you stay at this place and check your card statement afterwards!",

I wondered why we paid 598 for two nights, as opposed to the past 500. Now they have a valet for their funky garage, even though I used the handicap and the valet idd not park me, that was 30 over two nights. The end tables next to the beds are gone along with the drawer that I used to use. The open courtyard now has ping pong tables so you can no longer sit and read in peace. The small pool and tub were still nice. Also they used to have hair dryers in the baths but no longer. So it used to be good value and I see that Labor Day they are advertising the old price, but a valet for that garage is completely tacky and just an obvious attempt to get another dollar. Also no longer a printer and business space at the entrance, and no more fresh fruit there either, just tacky. I was totally surprised. good to see many of the same staff there. Ivan tremendous as usual,Antonio the same helpful friendly custodio..but it will take a bit to get me back",

    "reviewText": "We were pleased with a 1-night stay in this hotel. The renovated rooms are very nice, clean and pretty large considering it's LA. This hotel used to offer free parking and now since it's been renamed 'the Kinney' they only offer valet parking for 15. Not super expensive but I would have liked it to be free as I booked it when it was The Inn at Marina Del Rey which offered free parking. The only thing that was not great was the fact that the lobby, corridors and some common areas were under construction. The front desk area smelled of fresh paint and there were constantly workers around. Breakfast was surprisingly good, with scrambled eggs, bacon and a waffle station, with a very nice lady attendant. This hotel was about 15 minute walking from Venice beach and restaurants located next to it.",
