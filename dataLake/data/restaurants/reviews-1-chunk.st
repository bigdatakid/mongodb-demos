    "reviewText": "We came to Austin for a weekend get away and the Hilton Garden Inn was great! It's not the fanciest hotel but the staff was friendly and the room we stayed in had everything we needed: a comfortable bed, a shower with working hot water (though the pressure wasn't the best), free wifi, and a Keurig to make coffee. Each day in the lobby they also provide guests with infused water and unlimited coffee. We were planning on eating breakfast in the hotel one morning, but with so many great brunch places in the area we ended up eating out each day. One thing that visitors should be aware of is that they place a 50 hold on your card for incidentals. I was a little worried this would be an issue, but about a week after our trip, the hold was removed and no additional charges were added on my account. The hotel itself is a bit hard to find at first because it is hidden behind a Bone Daddy's restaurant on the front and the back of the hotel faces a residential area which made it hard for Google Maps to give us good directions. Despite the trouble finding it when we first got there, we enjoyed our stay enough that the Hilton Garden Inn is our new place to stay when we visit Austin.",
