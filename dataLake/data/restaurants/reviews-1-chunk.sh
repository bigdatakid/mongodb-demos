    "reviewText": "I have stayed at the IP three times in the past few years ... and EVERY time has been AMAZING! At check in, the employees smile and seem happy to be there, making sure to explain any additional charges that may apply during the stay. On my most recent visit, they printed a new player's card at the check-in counter for me, and replaced my husband's card too. The view from the room was of the ocean ... while yes, it is a ways away, there isn't much in Biloxi, and from our floor (20th) we were able to see it clearly. We always eat at the HighTide restaurant at least once every visit and this time was AMAZING. Since our last visit, I was placed on a restrictive diet and the HighTide was very accomodating to my insane requests. I had the fish of the day (Tilapia backened) and it was melt in your mouth fabulous. My husband said that his All American Breakfast hit the spot for him too. The casino isn't always friendly to us, but our luck is better here than at any other casino in either Vegas or Biloxi. We typically have one bad day followed by one REALLY good one. ... and we go home breaking even. And hey, we had the chance at the jackpot. :) The servers could use a wardrobe update ... I am not a fan of the exposed bra behind a corset top ... but asside from the atrocious attire, they are SUPER friendly and attentive. Of course, just like anywhere else, generous tipping will keep them coming around more often .... especially when you're drinking non-alcoholic beverages. :) Check out was easy and stress free as well ... and Juana, our room attendant, did a wonderful job on our last visit. I left her a tip when we left because she was awesome enough to leave us some extra coffee and creamer upon request. I will never stay anywhere else.",

The fire alarm kept going off on other floors and we would get closed in by the fire doors with no idea of what was going on until they would announce that we could go on with our normal activities. Coffee shop employees are very rude and obviously hate their job. Only plus to our trip was the pool staff and quench bar employees are wonderful.",
