Pool looked great unfortunately did not get to use it, other users seem to enjoy themselves greatly. I only wish that the breakfast was served at a later time, It was served too early for me to enjoy. Maybe next time. Thank you.",

Only got two towels no toilet paper. A baby crying all night. The beds were really old and worn. The dryers there took my money. The pictures on there are nothing what the hotel looks like. For the rate a paid I should have paid a little more for something a little nicer. Never going back to this hotel!",

    "reviewText": "The Fiesta Inn and Suites is not an INN nor SUITE. I will never ever stay in this place again! I walked up the stairs noticed alot of water on the ground \u0026 saw a leaking ice maker. Even though it was marked off it clearly has been an issue for some time due to waterstains around the ice maker. Finally got into room \u0026 noticed stained carpet \u0026 lack of lighting (one light bulb out \u0026 no lights in back area of room). The table \u0026 chairs appeared they were from a garage sale. We were so tired after traveling all day that we just wanted to lay down. My wife had to go to the restroom \u0026 saw a cockaroach in the sink when she turned on the bathroom light. She did not tell me till the next morning (I had already fallen asleep). So after I woke up, I had to go to the restroom \u0026 turned on the light upon entering noticed a couple of cockaroaches around the sink area. After discussing our plans for the day we wanted to shower \u0026 get ready for the day but lo \u0026 behold no bath towels. I go to Front Desk \u0026 informed that there are NO BATH TOWELS UNTIL 10AM WHEN HOUSEKEEPING ARRIVES. I was like are you serious? Front Desk apologized for the inconvenience but there was no offer to reduce cost of room nor provide credit in any way. There was no way we were staying any longer so we gathered our stuff \u0026 left the property. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE AT ALL WOULD PROBABLY RECOMMEND TO HOTELS.COM TO REMOVE IT FROM THEIR DATABASE.",

We checked out an hour later and drove 250 miles back home. Never again will I book there.",
