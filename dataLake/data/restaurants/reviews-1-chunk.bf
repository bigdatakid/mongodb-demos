Now I don't expect much from a cheap hotel and it is CHEAP but it is by far the worst I have ever seen and im not a 5 star hotel ,complaining wimp. But I had to write my very first hotel review!!.All 5 of the rooms we went through/viewed  in 3 nights smelled  BAD, the floors were so dirty and gross I never took my shoes off. The bathrooms were full of mold and filth the tubs look like someone tried to paint them 10 yrs ago and you didn't want to be be barefoot in there believe me.One shower had the on/off valve at the shower  head? Nicotine stained ceilings/walls with holes in them. Terrrible beds with bed bugs!  springs popping out ,comforters with all sort of unknown stains.The last room had the stove removed,leaving the natural gas pipe/valve  exposed with no plug on the line allowing anyone to turn it on.That is a very serious Hazard. The kind that LEVELS buildings killing everyone.When I told the desk she said oh thought they plugged those up..Im pretty sure these are rented as apartments during off peak times cheaper.The kind of damage substained to these rooms doesn't come from travelers with their families, there was grease so thick on the range hood and sides of the stoves you could scrape it off.The doors had all been kicked in and broke the trim making the doors barely able to latch",

Drawbacks: beds are just ok, only got 1 roll of tp and had to ask for more at the front desk (annoying), only got 2 towels and never got more despite asking several times, never made the \"complimentary breakfast\". They had coffee out but I didn't see any breakfast offered unless it was made to order for free. It was a bit loud Thursday night with people walking back and forth and hanging out at the pool, but surprisingly Fri was quieter. People at this motel tend to hang out outside and were often just outside our door area in a nonthreatening way.",

I saw some things that I'm pretty sure... I guess I'll leave it at that. It's an unsafe place. I felt like I needed to be on high alert. From the beginning I was uncomfortable, unwelcomed. I do not recommend this hotel at all.",

I am not tall and myfeet hung off the bed, they were barley bigger than a twinand they considered hem a full.... Overall would NEVER go back again.",

There was mold on the shower curtain, the shower curtain would not close all the way it kinda hung in the middle of the curtain rod because the rod was not firmly connected to the wall. The water never got hot, very poor water pressure.The towels were stained. Very dimly lit. The staff would sit on their cell phone talking while I was standing there waiting to ask for a wash cloth. I was then told someone would be by in a moment to deliver one. Never came. The door had a wide gap, wide enough to let a cold breeze in.",

The linens on the bed would not stay on because they used a flat sheet as a fitted. The towels were paper towel thin (and we had to actually ask for them because there was none in the room) The pull out couch was not a pull out. They didn't have the free breakfast that their website said they had. But you could \"purchase\" from their cafe. :( It is a very old, run down motel. The pool was nice size, but cloudy and dirty. The receptionist was great though. Would not be my choice of hotel if I come back to the area again.!!!",

I left the room the same day and did not return. The carpet is filthy and sticky, you cannot take off your shoes. The fridge was frosted over with ice and rusted. The toilet paper holder was the back of the toilet. There was no holder, just toilet paper sitting on back of the toilet. There was no phone in the room and after my second time asking for a phone, the person said she had to put in a work order, because people take phones out of the room and they don't know it's gone. It is not a safe place. I was told by a worker that the reason WIFI doesn't work in all areas of the hotel is that someone cut the power lines while trying to steal it. I would have more pictures to upload but my phone died since I spent about an hour on it trying to find a safer place to stay.",
