    "reviewText": "I've been to Nola a few times before and I haven't met a staff of hotel that I've loved better! The Staff was so welcoming to my group and always their to lend a hand when needing new door keys at 3am! Its wasn't very crowded at all so it was nice to be able to come and relax after a long day/night. The court yard with the pool is adorable and so refreshing! The room was great with ice cold air!! Our stay was perfect and we will def come back to stay here Again.",
