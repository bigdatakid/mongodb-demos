I was able to do a load of laundry for 2 and it was nice to have a continental breakfast and coffee to start my day. Along with their high standards of taking care of their rooms and property in general, they have a very friendly and positive group of employees. The staff was very friendly and helpful with every question I had and constantly smiling and greeting everyone that came through their door. The manager of the hotel even offered to give me a ride to the Greyhound bus station since I checked out at 12 and didn't leave until 5pm. This place went above and beyond to make me feel comfortable and welcome. Everytime I come to El Paso I will definitely be staying here and I would recommend it to everyone traveling through here.",

No golf course nearby the hotel sat right on the freeway. My room was clean the hotel was quiet. But the only amenities this place had was a laundry room the continental breakfast was exactly that cereal and muffins and coffee and Orange juice. Good for the price and for a 1 night stay this is not a family hotel this is more of a motel if anything.",

After finding the spider, I had my husband look between the sheet and blanket only to find multiple white crusty stains on the blanket!!! Eww. Needless to say, were slept in our clothes. Thankfully I had extra blankets to wrap my 6 month old son in. The guy at the front desk was no help.
