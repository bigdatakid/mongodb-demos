No washcloths footmats or handtowels and I called but they never brought any more. The toilet still had black filth under the rim. The air conditioner sounded like a lawn mower. The outside walls and doors had to be super thin because I heard several conversations during the night most contained wailing and cussing.",

The room was nasty, we could not take a shower because there was no knob to turn on the water not that I would have taken a shower in that scum covered bath tub anyway. The floor and tables had burns all over them when I specifically asked for a non-smoking room. There were cats living all around the hotel and drug deals going on right outside our door! I had my two year old son with me, I was terrified I didn't even want to leave until morning because I was scared something would happen to us. This place needs to be shut down! I took pictures of the room I wish there was a way to post them on here so everyone could see the horrible conditions of this hotel.",

    "reviewText": "This was the worst hotel we have ever stayed at. My parent room had roaches in it. The beds are so small. The room had a strange odor. The bath room was not very clean. The tub was in terrible shape, it looked dirty, but it was not. I was tempted to shower with my shoes on. The shower leaked down the wall, causing water to pool out on the bathroom floor. The ceiling above the shower looked like it had mold on it from a leak from the bathroom above us. The hair dryer was filthy. We did not sleep well at all the night we stayed. We just did not feel safe. Only GOOD thing I can say about this MOTEL is that the water got hot. Stay far, far away from this place.",

    "reviewText": "During the beginning check in- everything looked very quaint and as if it had a decent amount of value. It appeared as if it were very clean. I went out and had dinner- came back- relaxed, all was well. I was enjoying an infrequent bit of quiet time away from my soon to be ex-wife. However, during my sleep, I was caused to awaken very abruptly because I felt something crawling on me. Not only where they're very small roaches in the bed, but I found some on the walls of the bedroom. This caused me to get up- leave my keys on the coffee table and go home...... crazy at home is preferable to crazy at a hotel. The staff was very nice- extremely personable and friendly. However I don't believe there was anything they could have done at that point that would have made me comfortable. So I left.",

When I got to the door of the room I was given, I notice that the door was very, very dirty and sticky.  I gave it the benefit of a doubt that it was cleaner inside, since one should never judge a book by its cover, however when I open the door, I was meet by the moldy odor of the room.  That when thing really turn for the worst.  The AC was on, which made the foul smell worst, I went over to the standing AC, it was all corroded, the control panel cover was busted, there was no control knob.  So I had to turn off the AC, by turning on the metal piece.  The paint in the room was peeling off, the door frame was busted, the room was dirty, and the floor was dirty.  The room was just nasty.",

    "reviewText": "The buildings are old and in disrepair. The furnishings are old, mismatched and worn out. I booked a room with 2 full-sized beds and a pull-out couch. They sent me to various rooms, none of which were what I booked. We ended up in a room that seemed to be a 1 bedroom suite that had the living room furniture removed and a bed added. Space was really tight and the whole thing seemed cramped. The description of the hotel claims that a restaurant is located in the building. The menu for it was taped on the door. We were informed that the restaurant had closed. They also claim to offer free wifi, but I was never able to access it. The microwave was broken. The best I can say is that the shower didn't run out of hot water and the AC (only 1 unit, in the 1st bedroom) worked well. Luckily we were worn out and only needed a place to shower \u0026 sleep for 1 night. I cannot imagine staying there any longer than that.",
