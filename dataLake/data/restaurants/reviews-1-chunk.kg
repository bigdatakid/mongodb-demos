    "reviewText": "On arrival hotel has wow factor, our room was basic with a sea view but when it came to bed time the noise from the plant room sounded like a lighthouse foghorn and it was reported but no one got back to us. Food was disappointing as it was just the same thing every night with a slight ingredient variation so buy our 5th/6th night we were not eating. Staff favoured guests that were not wearing the All Inclusive wristband which was annoying as we had paid more for our holiday but this was purely tip oriented.",

    "reviewText": "Just returned from a week at the Hotel Elba Sara with my 16 year old daughter, very happy with the hotel, very clean and food was great, wide variety. One little thing we were disappointed with, was our flight was an evening departure and while we understood that the hotel was busy and late check out was but possible but no courtesy room was available even for an hour to shower etc, we ended up showering in the gym and trying to pack out last bits into the suitcase on the foyer floor, not ideal, give the calibre of the hotel this just let it down Hotel is located a bit outside the resort, nothing much in the vicinity, shops bars etc about 15 mins walk or 3,50euro in a taxi.",

    "reviewText": "A short 2 nights stay for us a married couple that live on Fuerteventura. The bathroom was not very clean, when you take a bath and can see UNDERNEATH the hand rails on the side of the bath you can tell. There was sand on the floor even though we never went to the beach. The bed was very hard for my comfort but I know some people prefer a hard bed. Breakfast was buffet style and not very appetising. There is a commercial centre next door and there was a very nice English restaurant that we would highly recommend. ' The Sea View' . This part of Fuerteventura is much more expensive than Corralejo. The hotel is about a 20 mins walk from the town but right opposite McDonalds, don't bother the meat is different here. The hotel is right on the flight path but the double glazing is good so did not bother us. The airport closes about 11.30 but the last flights arrive and depart much sooner. I think the airport opens about 7 or 8 am. Overall it was overpriced, not good value for money. Most guests were all inclusive, were not offered this option or would we have taken it anyway. The beer, wine and spirits are very poor quality. OK for young families I suppose.",

La habitacin amplia y muy limpia con camas muy cmodas. El buffet est bien pero un poco repetitivo despus de dos o tres das. Lo peor son los horarios que estn muy adaptados al turismo extranjero pero tampoco es un problema. La piscina la cierran a las 18:00 horas y recogen las hamacas aunque te puedes quedar ms tiempo. Los horarios de animacin tambin estn pensados para extranjeros. Si llegas ms tarde de las 21:30 olvdate de ver el espectculo de turno. No te dejan sacar platos del restaurante de la piscina para que te los lleves a las hamacas. Y el todo incluido termina a las 23:00 horas. La playa est muy cerquita aunque es artificial pero est bastante bien, sobre todo para los nios. Por lo dems, la estancia ha sido muy agradable. No me importara repetir.",
