First off, this is a great location if you're attending a race there. With heavy traffic, the drive was only about 30 minutes from the hotel to the TMS parking lot. The staff at this hotel were incredibly friendly and helpful, plus the food at the hotel restaurant/bar was delicious although a little pricey (which should be expected). The room (single king bed) was well appointed and included a moderately sized TV and mini fridge. Within walking distance, there is a sandwich shop, a pizzeria/Italian restaurant, and a liquor store. If you're looking for any late night entertainment or food, you'll have to settle for the hotel bar or drive elsewhere. As for some negatives from my stay, the thermostat for my room did not work and it was bit warmer in my room than I would have liked. Additionally, my room had several pill bugs crawling around the room. Finally, I was disappointed that the hotel charged for Wi-fi and internet connection. Overall, my stay was okay and I'd be willing to give this hotel a second chance considering its close proximity to the racetrack.",

Having only visited for conferences or for an occasional meal, we had never stayed overnight in a room. Perhaps the nostalgia made the experience better, but this typical Marriott room was rather homey to us. The bar and restaurant were familiar, and the staff was extremely kind and helpful. We enjoyed a Starbucks that had not been there before. We look forward to visiting again after the renovation of the hotel and the surrounding area is complete. It could become a destination!",
