The second morning, there were no hasbrowns, bacon , or link sausage put on the buffet. We have stayed at this very hotel quite a few times and the buffet was always wonderful. I don't know if they have changed kitchen management but I was not happy with the changes or the kitchen managers attitude at all. I found it offensive.

The staff were amazingly attentive (my aunt slid in the bar area and was immediately surrounded by 3-5 staff including the manager, all assisting and asking her if she was ok or needed anything). During breakfast, there was a sweet woman making multiple rounds, checking in on everyone and everything. The food at the bar was great. Our rooms were large and very clean.

I feel like the thermostat had a motion detector on it and room seemed hot at night. Also, my son forgot his ipod and I called a couple of times to see if it was turned in and it would have been nice if someone would've offered to take my number and maybe give an extra look in the room for me. Made me feel hopeless. Mostly everything.",
