The breakfast, however, was a concern due mostly to a tiny dining area which was far too small for a cold December morning and when the Inn was completely booked. The sole person expected to be desk manager/breakfast attendant was rightly overwhelmed and all felt empathetic that the staffing was inadequate for food service.",

There was a guy that sounded like he was coughing up a lung for several hours at a time that made it challenging to stay asleep, in the room next to ours, and additionally the same couple had a fight and we could hear the hilarious use of British swear words. I'd imagine they'd have moved us to a different room had we asked - thankfully the gent seems to have gotten cough medicine after the first night and we managed just fine.

Can't say enough good things about this place from the morning breakfast to the amenities they had, including free private parking. Stay for 2 days and didn't get in our car once. Loved the free trolley taking us everywhere, Cannery Row, Monterey Aquarium, Fisherman's Wharf. Wonderful! We also took the 3 Hr. Movie Tour which was beyond fantastic.

The room was clean and very spacious. We also enjoyed the daily breakfast in the common room. It is billed as a continental breakfast but is actually more than that considering that hard-boiled eggs, cereal, muffins, bagels, fruits and beverages are included.

Nous avons demand ds le lendemain changer de chambre et on nous a donn une chambre qui tait un peu mieux. Par contre les murs ne sont pas pais nous entendions tout ce que les voisins faisaient. Pas de double vitrage non plus et nous entendions les conversations dehors et les voitures passer. Le jaccuzzi sur le toit tait vide hors service.

    "reviewText": "Nous avons pass 2 semaines en aot 2013 avec notre fils de 7 ans. Notre avis est trs positif, habituellement on part en hotel club o on se retrouve loin de tout ! L c'tait diffrent, l'hotel est situ sur une longue pietonne (par la sortie de derrire) o on peut trouver une multitude de boutiques et de restos colls la plage Carihuela. Nous avons pris une formule en demi-pension et on ne regrette pas ce choix. Le petit djeuner est classique : buffet volont sans attente. Il n'y a pas de vrai jus d'orange seulement une sorte de sirop chimique. Au diner, on a toujours trouv quelque chose de bon manger, aucune queue pour aucun produit. Le personnel est trs agrable et au petits soins avec les clients. En revanche, l'eau est payante : 2,10 euros la bouteille de 50 cl (plate ou gazeuse). Autre mauvais point, en sortant du resto les vetement sentent fort la nourriture. La piscine est toute petite mais souvent vide, j'y suis all 2 ou 3 fois : mon fils tait presque seul dedans et moi j'tais sur un transat avec de la lecture. Les soirs dans le bar, il y a une animation : groupe de danse flamencon, chanteur ou mini club. A minuit souvent tout s'arrte pour laisser les gens dormir tranquillement. En sortant de l'hotel par derrire, droite 30 mtres sur la pietonne, il y a une agence de voyage qui propose des excursions moins chres que l'hotel. Nous sommes parti Grenade avec eux avec visite de l'alhambra. Seul bmol, le car fait le tourne des hotels",

Mit freundlichen Gren TripAdvisor-Service-Team ------Ursprngliche Bewertung------- Betreff: Hotel Roc Lago Rojo Ort: Torremolinos, Costa del Sol, Province of Malaga, Andalusien, Spanien, Europa Titel: Nicht sauber, alt, unfreundlich, schlechter service - Not clean, old, unfriendly, poor service - ID-Nr.: 334740612 German : English down: Hm.. Ich habe das Hotel vom 18.12.15-20.12.15 folgend erlebt und wahr genommen: Das Hotel war in einem verschmutzen Zustand. Das erste Zimmer haben wir gleich wieder beanstandet und zurckgegeben. Es war total verstaubt und ungereinigt. Das zweite war etwas besser, aber auch nicht richtig sauber. Unterm Bett voll Staub, Boden nicht sauber, Tisch nicht gereinigt. Die Zimmer sind denke ich mal etwa 30 Jahre al",
