The carpet looks original and this is an OLD place. No bolts on room doors and the bathrooms are tiny! You can barely turn around when you're at the sink because you'll trip over the toilet.

It is no more than a tired old motel with some new paint and a few accessories. The air conditioning didn't work, so we had to leave the sliding glass door open all night - first floor on the parking lot, so we slept with one eye open, since the neighborhood is a bit sketchy. We already moved rooms once, and were told that the room we had was the last of it's kind (with 2 queen beds) so we were stuck there. There was dried urine on the floor of the bathroom, and someone else's toothbrushes left on a shelf - I had to trust that they actually changed the sheets, but not sure about that. Finally, one of the guests next door was vomiting on the balcony in the middle of the night - so we finally realized that this is a motel for people who want to party all night - probably good for that, but not much else. Definitely not worth the high price we paid.",

We contacted the front desk and spoke to the supervisor Faustino who gave the worse customer service.He said yes I can see how our website can be misleading.

We asked for a roll out bed since the beds were small we wouldn't fit comfortably and he said no they can't because we already have two beds in the room. They brought us sheets so one of us had to sleep on the floor. The room had hair all on the bathroom walls, cracks in walls were just painted over, and sheets had stains. When we reserved for the shuttle the lady in the front desk advised us to meet in the front at 3:10pm and the driver will take us. We arrived on time in the front and we waited and waited eventually I went inside to advise them we're still waiting. It was Faustino who was at the front desk and he told me well it's a complimentary shuttle it's not guaranteed. I advised him we spoke to the lady earlier that day who took the information down for our reservation and she gave it to the driver and how can you ensure a customer of this service, we follow the directions given and than tell us it's not guaranteed.

I said no. 10 minutes later the cafe management came to our room (where there is a do no disturb sign) banging on our door trying to bully us into reordering breakfast because he said they cannot waste food.

Thank goodness I was on the end, but I still could here whenever anyone would talk in the hallway or shut their door. And the doors slam! Even when you are trying to be gentle. The decor is not great either. Next to the TV, there was just one big wall and a lot of space. It certainly didn't help damper any noise. Maybe hang up some sound-absorbent fabric. The guys at the front desk were good, so I cannot complain about the service. The location is great. The lobby was definitely remodeled to be ULTRA modern. Lot of orange and white.

The place is very old. The next morning to take a shower the shower head broke off. The maintence was very kind and very quick to fix it which was nice but inconvenient. They did put me in a room that was right next to the elevator which was very loud. But theh were nice to move me.",

    "reviewTitle": "Great Price Weird Smell",
    "reviewText": "The hotel was great for the price. It was close to Universal Studios. When we first got to the room there was no hot water. They did fix it however. There is also a weird musty smell in the room and throughout the hotel. Even with opening the sliding glass door it did not go away. It's probably because the hotel is so old and there is no exhaust fans in the bathrooms so the steam really gets going in be rooms. The walls and ceilings are paper thin so you can hear every door closing and everything that goes on around you. The hotel has been updated so don't let the hotel so old statement rub you the wrong way. The pool area and hot tub is extremely nice and well kept and the bar and bartender at the pool is a highlight of the property. One last issue is that you have to pay for parking with a hotel stay....ridiculous in my book! Again though for the price of the room it was a good deal and worked for what I needed.",

    "reviewText": "Hotel is probably over 50 years old and is in need of additional renovation. Pictures don't represent the true condition of the property. Lobby is very nice but the hallways are dingy. The room is huge and very comfortable. Beds are extremely comfortable. Rugs need to be replaced in the hotel and the dcor is in need of a major change. Pool is very nice and is huge. It can be loud - the hotel must book groups but pool view rooms do not have any road noise. The location is terrific. Down the street are a host of great restaurants, salons and a grocery store. Parking is super convenient and is free. Patio food is very expensive but serving size was enough for two.",

    "reviewTitle": "Nice but not for me",
    "reviewText": "This hotel has a large beautiful pool, which is the reason I booked it. My son is recovering from surgery and some of his therapy is done in a swimming pool. As it turned out, our schedule didn't allow him to even use the pool. The property also has lovely grounds with landscaping and fountains, and was in a nice neighborhood for me to take a walk. It is an older property, though, which means noisy elevators, small bathrooms, thin walls, etc. Redocorating doesn't change any of that. We had the wheelchair accessible room with a roll in shower that worked well for my son. There was enough space in the room to include a small refrigerator and microwave but they didn't. I guess they want you to order from room service, but that closes at 9:00 pm. Hello Despite the positives of the property, it really didn't meet our needs and I won't choose to stay there again.",
