We couldn't even pull up to the hotel in our car due to its position in the street. There is a tiny amount of space for cars to pull into the valet area in the front of the hotel. Once that area is filled with 2-3 cars, there is no where to even pull your vehicle to check in and unload the car. You end up in some garage down the street. Also, the front desk was not helpful when they kept repeating in half broken English, \"the valet will help you, the valet will take care of you\"-- yeah, maybe if WE COULD GET OUR CAR ANYWHERE NEAR THEM!However, once we finally got to out room, it was lovely. The rest of the staff was very courteous. I didn't appreciate the attitude if the woman at the front desk, but I still enjoyed my stay.",

    "reviewText": "You can't beat the location. Old Town Alexandria is charming, and the hotel is right in the middle of it. There are plenty of restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. The restaurant next to the hotel is a bit spendy, but pretty good. The room itself was a bit small, and I would have liked a lock on the bathroom door, but the beds and pillows were comfy, and the TV service adequate. Going into downtown D.C. was ~50 minutes door-to-door (to White House) by metro. I feel the hotel should offer a shuttle to the metro. We had to taxi, since the King street trolley only runs from 11AM - 7PM--walking to the metro, while doable at 20m, would have made for a tiring day touring D.C. The parking garage is old and space is tight, so a couple nights we had to pay to park elsewhere, but its workable. Most staff were nice, but a few times the staff were slightly less than helpful: room service comes too late in the day, and kept harassing us even though our child was napping and we asked them to come back later. One day while it was pouring rain outside, we tried to borrow an extra umbrella from the doorman (we're a family of 4 with 2 young kids), and were rebuffed [??]. But, the kids hour and wine hour are great, and the hotel is fun. Bottom line, the location is great, and the charm of the hotel and the surrounding area make some of the small inconveniences insignificant.",

Some of the fixtures in our room we loose or broken. 2. The fridge is locked and you have to ask for the key. Kinda odd. It's stocked full of wine, beer and liquor, plus some snacks and even socks!

    "reviewText": "What can I say.... this hotel is beautiful, well appointed, in an excellent location, well maintained and is funky in it's design but charming and cosy all at the same time.All members of staff were friendly, attentive, helpful and pleasant to talk to. Our room was impeccable, spotlessly clean and comfortable.The hotel is located on the main street in amongst the shops, bars, restaurants and only a 5/10 minute walk to the harbour. You would think that it would be noisy but I honestly didn't hear any noise from the main street.The indoor pool is small but it was clean and well maintained with a life guard on duty at all times.I really wished we had stayed here for longer, so if you're going to Alexandria this hotel is a must!",

The hotel is great- super nice staff, fun decor, comfortable rooms and bathrooms, only tiny negative is that their workout room is really small and limited, however, they DO have an indoor pool and there is a great running path along the river at the end of King Street. No in room coffee but complimentary coffee served in the lobby in the morning and wine in the afternoon.",

Examples: Showerhead that stays in one position (straight down because of faulty bracket), toilet that runs and hums long after the flush (don't think that's a feature), a totally dysfunctional internet, which they acknowledge was on the blink. Overall, the hotel just needs some management attention and it could easily be brought up to standard 4 star. It is not at the moment a 4 star.",

Our son slept in the lounge chair because of its novelty but the hotel provided us with a roll-away bed when we asked. The hotel pool on the third floor was fine but the only hiccup was that it is closed from 11-2pm.  The area has a large selection of restaurants surrounding the hotel so no problem getting a bite to eat. Complementary morning coffee was a plus.

When I called for my car, I was told 5-10 minutes by the desk clerk. I went to the lobby in 10 and sat there for 20 more minutes. Not one staff member asked if they could help me or if I needed my car as I sat with my yellow ticket in hand. When I finally went to the desk to ask it was still a further 10 minutes before my car was brought up. I would have been happy to self park, if only I had been aware of the availability. You can exit the room and go straight to your car from the main elevators.The room was freezing, the unit made so much noise that it woke me up every time it cycled on and off. There were no extra blankets available in the room and so I spent my first night awake and freezing. I asked via a note the next day for housekeeping to leave an extra. The fried was also loud. I was next to the elevators which pinged all night. There���s no sound proofing and you can hear every conversation happening in the hallway. I used to think I was one of those youngish types who would frequent this type of hotel but I guess not as I'd be considerate not to make my evening plans loudly outside someone's room at 11PM.",

The most disappointing was the lack of cleanliness in the bathroom. While taking a shower (that has great water pressure), you pull back the shower curtain and the liner is loaded with hair that is not yours. I stayed at this hotel for 5 night. I asked the front desk on my first night if they could empty out the mini refrigerator of it's over priced items. This never happened. I just left everything on top of the TV stand. House keeping never got the message or the hint that I left. Why is it that a hotel 6 don't charge for internet or parking but when you pay over $180.00 a night for a hotel you will pay for all separately.",

    "reviewText": "The Hotel Monaco is a beautiful place to stay. The lobby is wonderful. The elevators well decorated. Marble throughout the hotel. Very impressive. However, after returning from a wonderful day on the town, having dinner and a few drinks, this is where our stay turned sour. Unbeknown to us, the room air conditioner wasn't working well at keeping the room cool! After looking at the room temperature control, the climate settings only allow a range from 65 degrees and a high of 73 Sweating all night! Horrible night sleep! Ceiling fan would have helped. For the price, I thought someone would have checked to see if we were comfortable. We decided to relocate elsewhere. Very disappointed.",

I was so impressed by the small details that every staff member took to make sure that our stay was excellent. There was someone there with a smile to help load and unload luggage, park the car, and they even took the time to have the crib in our hotel room before we checked in. Not once did I have anyone that was less than professional approach me. I would recommend this hotel to anyone that is traveling and demands a four star hotel for your family.",

We were happy to wait and could have lived without the unpleasantness. - Took 20 minutes and two phone calls to get our luggage up to the room after we were able to get in; on top of that they misplaced a very large pregnancy pillow that was placed in the office for safe-keeping. We finally had to walk down to find and retrieve it ourselves. - Found a black hair under the comforter upon arrival. - We were out of the room for at least 7 hours during the next day and no one cleaned our room. - The TV picture flickered on almost every channel. - We asked for a cart to bring our luggage down at checkout and no one came after 20 min. Finally had to go down to get one ourselves. Downstairs, an empty cart was sitting next to several bellhops who were chatting away to one another.",

The only downside to it was that the restaurant was short staffed one morning so we decided to go to another nearby spot for breakfast. We later learned from a bartender that one of the wait staff is pregnant and had been sick several times lately. And the bar closes early. There were quite a few people still in it when they made last call around 11 I believe. There is a wine happy hour every day from 5-6 in the lobby. One of the pourers actually remembered what I and my wife drank the night before. Finally, I had nearly forgotten this but the elevator doors close very quickly. We missed two because we were slow in getting there. Doesn't bother me, but I wonder if some seniors might find it difficult. Overall, nice rooms, fantastic location and nice, friendly staff.",
