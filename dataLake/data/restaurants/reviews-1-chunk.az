Finally hold on to your wallet when you are preparing to leave. They hit you with resort fees that aren't disclosed and its per day plus tax on each fee. And also I made a 44 second phone call and next to the phone it says it would be 2.00 a min. Well when the check out bill came they hit me with a 15 connection fee on top of it. totaling about 20 for less than a minute on the phone. called the customer service desk and the lady flat out lied saying it was disclosed on the card next to the phone. What is this the 1920's I think that was another lie about the att connection fee. Then she said well we can't disclose it because att changes the rate all the time. The resort itself was very nice but we will never go back with the way we were treated by staff and the whole organization in general.",

When Glen from the market Grille learned of our celebration, he made a reservation for us the following night. Upon arrival, our table was ready donned with linen, fine wine glasses, birthday confetti, flowers and an anniversary balloon. We were treated to a full course meal and flowing bottles of Darioush wine with personal and impeccable service from Glen. Thank you, Glen, for a birthday/anniversary I will never forget !",

It was so late when we arrived that we did not have much time to look around but the restaurant at the clubhouse was open and had great live music. The food was also amazing! Not what we expected since most resorts are high price - low quality. There was so much food but since we did not have a mini fridge or microwave we could not take the leftovers. Since checkout was not until noon, it gave us plenty of time to explore the grounds and take a stroll on the nature walk. There are so many beautiful plants and the area is so peaceful. We will be sure to visit the resort again when we have more time so we can check out the pool and spa facilities.",

    "reviewText": "Innisbrook was nice and relaxing with great pools. Extremely disappointed in Packard's Steakhouse. Took my Father for Father's Day dinner and it was hands down the worst steaks we have ever eaten. Two of us ordered the special of filet mignon medallions and the meat tasted like it was either broiled or boiled. Absolutely no flavor and the peppercorn sauce tasted like they put peppercorns and water in a blender to make the sauce - absolutely horrible. My husband's steak was unedible as well - no flavor, very tough, and I think it was broiled too. Spent almost 300.00 on the entire dinner and the bread was the best part. Waitress didn't know the menu either. Told us our dinner came with broccoli and mashed potatoes so we ordered a large side of asparagus only to have our dinner come with asparagus - total waste of the extra side.",

The room I was in faces a busy street so there was some traffic noise, and there may be safety/security concerns for some guests. The room door opens to the outside, and there's about a 2-3 minute walk through the parking lot (no paved footpath) to go to the office or the pool from the room. The staff wasn't that friendly I'd guess they get customers trying to push the rules frequently. They wear ribbons and get stars if customers write a good review, but the scheme seems a bit forced. Overall, the hotel was decent, but I wish I'd paid another 20 to stay in a nicer hotel.",

    "reviewText": "Old unkept building with a staff that lacked basic skills. It took the front desk guy over an hour to get me checked in because he had no knowledge on how to operate a computer. I then got to my room where the AC was off and had been for a while because the room was 88 degrees. I kicked in the AC which sounded like a diesel truck idling next to my bed. It cooled the room down in about 5 hours. The room smelled of mold and the toiletries from the previous guest were still in the room (bars of soap with someone else's hair on it). Overall I would not recommend this hotel to anyone, especially families. I do believe I saw a couple females who specialize loitering on the property asking people if they wanted to party",
