    "reviewText": "We really enjoyed the history behind the the Lamothe House and the location can't be beat! Our room was spacious, the bed was awesome and despite being so close to sometimes raucous Frenchmen Street, we couldn't hear a thing when we finally made it back to our room after a long day of exploring, eating and having fun. The surrounding area is much preferred over the French Quarter because there is less noise and less of that oh-so familiar Bourbon Street smell. The only draw back was that the alley way to our room was a tad narrow and dark at night but the great, secure parking more than made up for it. We will most definitely return!",

    "reviewText": "We were there for Jazzfest, we stayed 4 nights in a ground floor room, the room itself was small but considering everything to do in New Orleans we really just wanted a place to sleep. The hotel itself is old yet boasted newly renovated, which was far from anything we saw there but on another note, the hotel itself is in a perfect area to be in it all yet away from it all at the same time! We loved the location! It was a short walk to Bourbon Street and Frenchman's was literally right out the back entrance. The courtyard was nice and lush and the pool and jacuzzi were also an added bonus. Nights were quiet yet close enoughbto find all the action. We enjoyed our stay and will be back.",

We could hear people walking by and talking, and bar music, but had no problems. AND, we found the hotel left us ear plugs in the night table (not discovered until the 2nd night.) Keurig coffee, nice hot shower, very clean room and great comfortable bed with plenty of pillows.",

    "reviewText": "On the Esplanade side of New Orleans' French Quarter, the Lamothe House is in what I like to call the vampire district, and I mean that in a charming, Anne Rice way. It's two blocks from French Street, where the best blues-jazz can be heard and with a cool local crowd. It's also just far enough away from the insanity of the Bourbon St scene to make it accessible without the nuisance. The only drawback is that it is about 2.25 miles from the Superdome, Conv. Center, etc. The building is well-preserved by 18th century NOLA standards (a city built on cotton bales for soil stability), but I would not recommend it for children. Elderly and handicapped should stay on the ground floor, but not stay away. This is a lovers' hotel.",
