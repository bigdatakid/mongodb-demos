The property offers quite a few restaurant options and a large gift shop / convenience store. The outside / entrance to the hotel casino could use a little extra care. It's starting to show the first signs of being neglecte and outdated. The river side of the hotel is kept up much better. The buffet is a good price and the food was okay for the money. Some of the items like the salmon and roast beef were way over cooked . The staff was friendly except for a man at the rewards counter who didn't give us all the information we needed about our rewards cards and had an attitude like we were bothering him.

Finally we moved to a different room. The room smelled fine but the tv didn't work. My fianc called front desk, after about 10 minutes someone picked up and told him to turn to a specific channel (48) and leave it on there for a while then it should work. How does that even make sense I have to idea. But we did it. Of course it didn't work. So he called no one picked up. So we stopped by the front desk on our way to dinner and they said they would send someone to fix it. Hours later we got back to the room and it still wasn't fixed.

Our family was unable to communicate with each other by text. Eventhough we stayed in the family tower, the hotel wasn't very kid friendly. My 13 year old complained about the cigarette smoke was amazed by the number of adults drinking liquor at the breakfast buffet. The buffet was also not a good family value and the food seemed old. Our family will not stay at a casino hotel again.",
