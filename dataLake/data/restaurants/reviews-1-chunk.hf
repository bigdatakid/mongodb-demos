Prices start from 90cents with good local inexpensive wines. Lots of locals use this tapas bar. Tricky getting from Murcia city to Murcia San Javier airport (40 km) - quoted 70 euros for taxi. Train to nearest station would cost 13 euros plus a further 23 euros to get from train station to airport. We used the no 70 bus, leaves from stand number 8 in the main bus station (4.35 euros) to San Javier town and then a 10 euro, 5 minute taxi ride. allow plenty of time to get your bus tickets. We felt that 2 nights were enough in Murcia, which is a big regional and commercial center.",
