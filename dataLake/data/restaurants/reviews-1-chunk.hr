Called for the sheets and was told I would have to go back to the desk to get them. Coffee maker was broke. The people that stayed prior to us had filled it wth water. Machine was broke so it was left that way. It leaked all over the tea and coffee packets. Ice machine was broke on our floor. The hallways were dirty and had not been vacuumed and also had stains. Breakfast was subpar. Had stayed at Drury Inn in St Louis prior 2 days and they were fabulous. Will stay at Drury Inn in St Peters in the future!",

But they didn't really seem surprised and/or concerned that someone had disregarded this little rule. The second night I stayed, I was in a room that had the smoke alarm covered in black electrical tape...presumably so someone could smoke. The room was clean and there was no smell. But it's a bit disturbing knowing that they clearly hadn't looked at or tested the smoke alarm in the recent past. Otherwise, it's a Comfort Inn. It could be better, but it's an ok place to rest your head. The neighborhood is nice and there was no noise from the highway.",

And as far as I could tell, others did not either. I had to again carry my infant son back down the front desk, and he was awoken from his nap because of this.

After that it took a while for the desk clerk to appear and check us in. GENERAL: All of the hall carpets throughout the motel hallways look like someone or something had motor oil diarrhea from one end to another. Big black stains up and down. Likewise, all of the walls in the hallway had black skid marks up and down. OUR ROOM: Third floor no internet and they know it. Also, ice machine broken on 3rd. Carpets in room - filthy. Don't look in the corners of the bathroom. Just don't. Bed was ok, but the spread on top was questionable in cleanliness. BREAKFAST: Scrambled eggs, no breakfast meat as advertised, biscuits gravy -ok, cereal, bagels, toast, Danish. Not as advertised. OVERALL: General feeling of uncleanliness uneasiness throughout the stay (the drinking gang and local area). Poor quality service, poor attention to details, terrible management.",

Upon arrival (around 9pm) we were disappointed that there was no door staff/valet etc so we ended up taking in the luggage ourselves. When the bellman did see me they didn't offer to help. Check-in was quick and front desk girl was very friendly, greeted Dori by name and offered her a pet package. The room was large and comfortable but there were some areas where you can see the hotel is showing some wear and tear. Overall still very good. All the amenities of a Kimpton including 4pm Kids Hour, 5pm wine hour and most importantly for us Pet Friendly. The hotel was very busy as it was Memorial Day weekend so the restaurant and room service had delays but that's to be expected. I would choose this hotel again especially for the proximity of being in the middle of Old Town, several blocks from the water front and in the midst of amazing restaurants like Restaurant Eve.",

When I arrived, without warning, the bellhop led us to a standard double room (the cheapest type, with no balcony). I explained to him that we'd reserved a room w/ a balcony, he called the front desk and they told him none was available. He handed the phone to me \u0026 I asked the girl on the other end if I could speak to a manager. He was rude, did not apologize for the situation, \u0026 flatly told me that because I had booked through a certain third-party reservation site, there was nothing he could do about the error. He eventually clarified that since I had booked a room with one bed (albeit a King), but had asked for a second bed, they simply changed the reservation to a double room. He said there was no way to notify me of this, because the third-party reservation company does not supply the names or phone numbers of people who make reservations. He had no explanation for how the hotel front-desk staff had been able to match my name \u0026 ID to a reservation. Anyway, he refused to refund the difference in the price of the room. He offered to put us in a room with a balcony the next day. He told me to start calling them the next day at about noon to see if one would be available. One eventually did come available the next day at 5 p.m. \u0026 we took it. It was too dark to even see the balcony (half the point of a balcony room was to have the extra sunlight). I complained about it long enough that an hour later, someone showed up with a free bottle of wine \u0026 an apology letter for the \"miscommunication\", but there was never a refund of the difference in the price of the rooms, \u0026 the bad customer service made the trip a little worse than it needed to be.Our first room on the 6th (top) floor had too little water pressure to take a good shower. Other than that, the hotel itself was perfectly nice. Hopefully the manager moves on. I may try it again next time I'm in the area, but I would not recommend booking this hotel through a discount hotel website.",

    "reviewText": "After reading about the Hotel Monaco online, I changed my reservation at the Marriott, and I was very glad that I did. You would expect to pay a lot more for this hotel that what our room rate was. The Kimpton hotels are so cool - loved the room decorations, efficient bathroom, comfy beds and lively lobby. Being a pet friendly hotel, it didn't smell. The outside furniture in the courtyard area was so relaxing at night. The menu for dinner was a bit different than what we expected and I would not eat there again. I loved this hotel and would stay there again when I go to Old Town to visit my son and his fiance.",

We were just a few blocks from just about everything we wanted to do. (Oh... and they have an indoor pool that we got a *lot* of use out of.)I wasn't expecting anything other than another cookie-cutter hotel, and I was really surprised at how wrong I was.",

I have a personal dislike of duvets, but the hotel furnished the proper blanket.",

On the way to the metro station are lots of unique shops and restaurants. The area was totally safe for walking. The hotel is very close to the waterfront and the Torpedo Factory Art Center and the street entertainment in that area. Located on King Street this is a beautiful area to come back to after the bustle of DC. I hope to return again next year and will definitely stay in this hotel. Wish we had had more time.
