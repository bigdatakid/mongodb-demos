I love where the hotel is located in Old Town. There are so many shops, bars and restaurants no matter if you walk to the right or left. I felt very safe even walking at night.

He was wonderful-the rooms were wonderful-the lobby was wonderful. Everything was wonderful. Well, almost everything. Our only problem was the air conditioner in my parent's room. When we notified the front desk, my parent's were moved to a new room immediately. I appreciated the speed at which the problem was addressed. The rooms were lovely, so large and roomy. The bathroom was spotless and equipped with great toiletries, hairdryer, and even q-tips and cotton balls! Really fun robes are in all the closets. Free wi-fi, huge flat-screen TV, in-room safe, and a beautiful chaise lounge chair. I loved this hotel. I've never stayed in a place where everyone was so incredibly friendly. The location was excellent-CVS pharmacy on the next block-a great restaurant next door-La Madeline. The King Street Trolley was convenient when we were on King Street but it was not very timely when we were needing it at the King Street Metro-it would finally show up but be prepared for a wait. Overall, we couldn't have been more pleased with our stay. This is a first rate establishment and we hated to leave.",

    "reviewText": "This is a nice hotel let down a bit by the standards of service. Rooms are well equipped and designed and very comfortable. We only used the restaurant once but that meal was as good as we experienced in our stay.There is a a pool which given that temperatures never fell below 30 during our stay was very welcome at the end of the day. It needs some refurbishment and nowhere to shower before using it!The glass of wine available in the lobby for an hour each evening is a nice touch but the accompanying nibbles were poorThe staff are friendly and anxious to help but seemed to have limited knowledge of local facilities. An email enquiry prior to arrival went unanswered and I contacted hotel services 3 times during our stay about other things and on each occasion had to chase them up to get an answer.The hotel is situated at the river end of the long King St and is ideally placed for boat trips and the entertainment facilities. The metro is a good 15 minute walk to the other end of the street and although there is a free shuttle it does not start until 11amWe enjoyed our stay at the hotel and liked it. Alittle bit more attention to detail and it would live up to its own billing",

The location was awesome, since there is lot's to do in Old Town Alexandria plus it is close to Airport and Washington DC. I will truly recommend it!!! Oh by the way they also had 24 hour Room Service :o)",

The location was nice and there were many restaurants, stores, and other attractions available for one to investigate and enjoy. Check-in and check-out were smooth with no problems. Would definitely stay again, for a longer period of time. Great hotel!",

It's really a wide alley between two buildings that's set up with tables and chairs for people to hang out. Lots of barking from their dogs till 8:00 PM. Parking's a bit expensive at $25 in their garage. No vouchers. I asked.",

    "reviewText": "We chose this hotel due to location, and because we had been here previously for one night; we stayed several days this time. Location can't be beat. Room amenities are excellent. Bed was a little hard. Staffers are very nice, but they seem to need more. Front doormen seemed more interested in chatting with each other than serving guests but once you got their attention, they could be helpful. If you stay here, you MUST love dogs. The hotel is overrun with guests' dogs who are all generally well-behaved, but they are everywhere. We knew the hotel was dog-friendly but it was rather overwhelming. We will stay here again, but at a time when there are fewer families likely to be traveling (hence, fewer dogs).",

We didn't ask the staff for assistance because we were just too tired to deal with it after spending the day at a family wedding. Luckily, we were able to open the windows and it was much better.  Aside for this issue, the hotel is great, the service is great and the location is fabulous!   I would stay there again on my next visit to VA.",
