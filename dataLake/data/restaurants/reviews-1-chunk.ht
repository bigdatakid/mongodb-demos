Mind you, we have a siberian husky, so the AC problem was not what we needed. We were upgraded to a two floor suite with two separate thermostats, the bottom stayed cool, but the upstairs was still unbearable. Overall, the manager tried to appease us with the room upgrade, and even paid for our dinner one night and parking for three nights. But sleeping in 74 degree plus temps is not my idea of a comfortable vacation, regardless of the accomodations or benefits.",

The food and its service was my only disappointment.The brocolli cheese soap was cold when we got it, but the hummus was well-warmed to a degree that would have better suited the soup.My mother didn't received any napkins or utensils, so I shared my knife with her for the hummus/pitas.I ended up pulling out some travel napkins from my bag. I wish there had been a coffee maker in the room, but we ordered a carafe of it for breakfast.So those were the annoyances, but the room was so gorgeous felt roomy and was so well-appointed and comfortable.

    "reviewText": "It was the luck of the draw that I picked the Monaco in downtown Alexandria. DC has always been a difficult, if not frightening experience for me. Then along came Kimpton's Hotel Monaco Alexandria. Our room was a single king. It came with a large flat panel TV, pre-filled goody shelf and fridge, Free WiFi, nice lounge and plenty of room. The decorating was tasteful, well done, and quite comfortable. The most exceptional part of the hotel, however, was the staff. It was obvious that they had been well trained from house keeping to management. All were polite, helpful and made us feel welcome and at home. The location is incredible. It is located on King St about 4 blocks up from the river and one more block from the Ferry stop. King St is the main artery that runs through the heart of old town Alexandria. The setting is beautiful and relatively quiet. There are shops and restaurants up and down both sides of the street for blocks. History abounds here so there is plenty to do just in the local area without going into DC. If you want to do the DC thing, there is a free trolley which runs every 15 min from 10am to 10pm the length of King St (20 blocks) to drop you off at the Metro station. You can pick up the blue line there which will take you to about any site you want to see or get to including National Airport. Old Alexandria is a very comfortable place to be. I felt at ease walking along King St any time of the day or night.",

    "reviewText": "I usually enjoy Kimpton Hotels, and the Monaco has great potential, however it is also a favorite spot for weddings, and apparently they are not staffed well enough to keep things under control, leaving non-wedding guests suffering. There were children lacking appropriate adult suervision galloping up and down my hall, dogs left alone in rooms and barking incessantly, and all the manager could tell me was they would send someone up to check, the dogs' owners' had been called...blah blah blah. By 10 pm I had given up and tried to find another local room but none could be found for me. The manager assured me the wedding was over at 11, however that just happened to be when the die-hards moved the party to the courtyard; drunken guests whooping it up and taking flash photos. I had had a rough couple of days and just desperately wanted to go to sleep early that night; I finally passed out at 1 am. My night was comped when I spoke to the day manager in the morning, but the damage was done. The wedding party was obviously the priority to the night manager, who completely failed the rest of the guests in his charge. I MAY give the place another chance, during the week, but probably not.",

They set up reservations for us at the Chart House on the Potomac River and ordered us a desert on them.  We also had menus printed out with our name on top saying congratulations.  The staff was incredible and we would stay at any Kimpton hotel again if the experience was like the one we had.",
