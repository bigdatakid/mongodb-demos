While the husbands were checking the rooms out the wives were in the car witnessing what appeared to be drug dealers moving out at a very fast pace. And we were scared. Also, the floors sounded like they were going to fall through. A previous review stated it was a bit run down, that is a huge understatement. More like they need to burn the place and start over. There is a bar next door with very loud music and it appears that people stay here after leaving the bar. Plus the rooms we booked were not even available. So by this time it was 1am and we left and found a different hotel. And the next morning it has been an hiur and we are still fighting with them trying to",

I thought maybe he was extra picky and exaggerating the situation but I was wrong he was right. The rooms were upstairs, the first step to go upstairs was broken up concrete with the re bar showing and bent down to the ground so you had to skip it and start with the second step. All 3 rooms were dirty, half of the lights didn't work the floor was weak in places, there were stains on the sheets and comforters and hair in the a couple beds (some human some dog). Questionable activity in the parking lot possibly drug dealers and or user's. We went back to the counter and told the man that we were sorry but all 3 rooms were unacceptable and we were going to try to find somewhere else to stay he said ok he understood and gave me a print out showing we didn't stay. The next day I contacted hotels.com and asked to get our money back and they said the hotel had a hold on it and they called to get the hold released but the hotel wouldn't release it. I went to the hotel to find out why and a guy claiming to be the owner wouldn't cooperate I was very polite and patient and he started good but quickly got rude and said it's not his fault we chose to leave and he would not release the hold. After trying to reason with him for a little while he said at that point we were trespassing and called the authorities. After about 15 minutes no one showed up and so I called the authorities to see what my options were and they said it was a civil dispute and suggested I contact the hotels corporate office.

I could live without shampoo, but what hotel doesn't provide a small bar of soap The area is fine and very close to the airport.

I felt that I was ripped off because when I reserved the room I payed on line the total of 98.00 when I checked in they wanted to charge me 76.00 I told them I had already payed on line, and of course a sign stated no refunds. When I went on line to search for hotels and I looked at the pictures from the web site it looked very nice. I do not know when they were taken but I really think they need to be taken down. it was very unfair and very misleading I would not like this to happen to any one else.",

This was available and paid for immediately on booking.When we got to the hotel after the allowed check-in time, we were told that they did not have that room available. We offered to stay in a 2 bed room, either double beds or queens. At this time one of the 2 girls at the counter proceeded to go to clean a room! We said just to give us a smoking king instead and we would make do with that. As we drove around the hotel to where our room was located, we noticed curtains hanging off windows in some rooms and others appeared that the lining may have been ripped away. We opened the door to the room and closed it again...it was very small, dirty and smelly !! We went back to the desk and said we could not stay there and requested our money back. They said that there was a no refund policy. I realized this when I booked but they were not able to deliver the room which I had paid for so should have made the exception because of this. We did not stay at the hotel but decided to continue on to another city to find accommodations. This is the first bad review that I have given a hotel. We are happy having a clean room and bathroom and comfortable bed and don't require much more than that. We are senior citizens who have travelled extensively and I have never booked a hotel as terrible as this one. I want to let everyone know that it is not as pictured online and suggest that they avoid this hotel.",

I went back to front desk and asked for another room. The lady gave us another room and was very curtious. Problem with this hotel is the owners are cheap, everything was unplugged, so at first we thought nothing worked.I would recomend that before booking your hotel with an agency to find out if the owners are from India. I speak from experience. It is better to spend an extra 50 for comfort, than to feel like you have been robbed. You are on vacation, cut back someplace else not lodging.",
