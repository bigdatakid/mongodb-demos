    "reviewText": "This hotel was definitely just average. The room had up-to-date comforters and drapes with a more modern look. But the physical structure of the room was old. The drywall had lumpy patches, the bathroom looked old and well worn and the size was on the small size like that of a 1970s hotel which it probably was. The air conditioner had an intense musty smell and was probably the original A/C from when the hotel was built. The bathroom had quite a bit of hair on the floor and the grout was dirty everywhere. On the plus side, the sheets were comfortable, good pillows and the A/C cooled the room real well. The breakfast buffet had items, such as, waffles, boiled eggs, muffins, breads, cereal, oatmeal and yogurt, along with coffee, milk, apple and orange juice. And the price was much better than the neighboring hotels.",
