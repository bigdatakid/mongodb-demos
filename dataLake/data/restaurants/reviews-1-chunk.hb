The hotel had lots of character, an incredible view to the sea, and was close enough to the town centre for walking but just far enough for peace and quiet. Breakfast was phenomenal. When we first checked in there were a couple of minor niggles in the room (leak in bathroom, faulty TV), however as soon as we told staff they moved us to a new room that was perfect, and were very apologetic. Five star service.",

You are made to feel very welcome on arrival and that attention from staff continues throughout the stay (the mini-fridge and some lights in the room that weren't working on our arrival were looked at as soon as we mentioned them and then fixed the following morning). The staff are the hotel's strongest asset. The breakfasts on the roof terrace and the dinner in the restaurant were the best breakfasts and dinner respectively that we had on our 13 night 5 hotel stay in Sicily. Try the sea bass mimosa. The junior suite was smaller than anticipated with the bedroom only providing a little walk around space either side of the bed and the seating area where the settee was located being quite narrow so that sitting on the settee you were very much aware of looking straight at the wall opposite. The sitting area was only lit by spotlights and so was quite gloomy at night when natural light was absent and for some reason one of the spotlights was removed from the room on day 3 while we were out. We'd certainly have asked for this to be replaced if we had not been leaving the following morning. The bed was comfy. The outside space was quite generous with 2 loungers as well as a small table and chairs set. The hotel has a small pool and a reading room/lounge and decent wi-fi. The roof terrace has great views of Etna and the sea and is a good place for a pre-dinner cocktail or glass of wine.",

Etna to our right, to the sea at our feet, it was truly breathtaking. Day excursions to Siracuse, Mt. Etna and Castlemola plus a day just wandering around town made for an unforgettable vacation. The views from Etna and Castlemola were simply breathtaking - as was the drive up narrow, winding roads! Another pleasant surprise was the quality of Sicilian wines. The luxury apartments of the Villa Carlota were first class is all respects. Simona and Riccardo were absolutely first class in making us feel at home and helping us with recommendations on dining and sightseeing trips. Could not ask for two better hosts.

We had just driven 8 hours and it was snowing, so that wasn't something we wanted to do. Our room was very small with an option to be connected to the room next door if it was family. Since we didn't have family the door remained locked, but we could hear all the conversations, music and TV thru the door cracks. Coffee maker is stored under the sink in the bathroom. If you want to use it, you have to remove everything from the VERY SMALL counter space that is there. There is NO counter space in the room, only 4 drawers. View was nice from the windows, shower was nice. I requested a queen size bed, and got a double bed. My husband is 6'2 and his feet were hanging over the edge. Bed and mattress needed upgrading. Might be great for skiers who just want to ski and crash and not have any amenities or comfort. Even the main lodge had no where to sit and be comfy, as it was dark and had workmen in there cleaning.

There is a nook in the room which a shelf could easily be added for the coffee maker and ice bucket making room around the sink. In addition there is room for a chair in the room and would be easy to provide a lap desk (board to be placed on lap for laptop, etc). If you are going to use room as individual hotel room these should be a minimum since the main room is not available. I asked the front desk to have maintenance unlock the safe (locked shut by previous tenants) and they logged the request. Reminded them each morning and never done...on checkout the front desk did remove parking fees since this was not accomplished. In addition requested a temporary chair but never delivered. Front desk staff was great and did their job but beyond that nothing happened. Overall staff at desk, restaurant, and housekeeping were friendly and did an outstanding job.

    "reviewText": "It was a bit overpriced for the tiny little room with the soft bed we were booked in. The manager offered us a bigger room, but since we only had one more night until we were off on our next great adventure, we decided to stay in the room we were in. The bed really needed to be replaced, it was way too soft. The valet service was a bit of a hassle, though they were quick about getting our vehicle to us. The dog fee was a bit steep. At least the stunning snow capped mountains surrounding the lodge was free. Thank goodness, because the view was priceless!",
