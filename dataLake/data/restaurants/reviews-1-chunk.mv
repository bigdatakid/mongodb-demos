There was dead bugs on the floor, the TV cables were cut open, no door to the restroom, the restroom smelled beyond disgusting \u0026 the windows were broken but taped. My husband and I were so mad, we went back to cancel and get out money back. DO NOT stay here. It's very shady and disgusting. Never again. They should be reported.",
