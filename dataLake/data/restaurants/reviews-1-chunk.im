    "reviewText": "Overall, we were very disappointed with our stay at the g. Junction Hampton inn. Our room smelled horrible from a previous smoker. We informed staff but there were no other rooms available to change. My husbands allergies were elevated due to the smokey smell. We asked the front desk the following morning if we would be eligible for a credit based on the company policy that customer satisfaction is 1 priority, but she couldn't help us since we booked with hotels.com. We're usually loyal Hampton inn customers, but not anymore. We will not book a reservation with Hampton Inn again!",

The double queen rooms have no refrigerator though, which is strange to me seeing how even the cheapest of motels have fridges in all of their rooms. The rooms are clean and well-maintained, the beds are comfortable, the staff are friendly. 4 out of 5",

    "reviewText": "The Hotel was very nice. The unexpected was the 6.00 per day to park your car at the hotel. I have paid that before in major metropolitan areas but not in Grand Junction. This will be a consideration next time I travel there on business and where I stay. There are many other hotels in a 5 mile drive that do not charge this. Maybe its because it's next to their convention center.",
