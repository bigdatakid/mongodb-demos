The mattress was hard and the sheets not clean. The neighbors were smoking marijuana on our way to breakfast the following morning before our cruise. The breakfast was continental at best and was average at best. The only good thing I can say, is that it was close to the port. Also the parking spaces are very small and back up right next to a shady looking restaurant. Right around the corner, it appears to be a much better neighborhood. Would definitely pass on this one the next time we head that way, even if it means staying a little further away from our destination.",

He honestly looked like he hated his job and wanted to kill himself because of it. We proceeded to go to the room which had a musty gross smell to it. Turned on the A/C and it made the room smell more gross. The floor had sticky stuff in certain areas and was disgusting. Then WiFi barely worked, luckily i was able to use my phone to tether. The only good thing about this room was the comfy king size bed. I asked for late checkout and the guy told me he can only give me till 11:15-11:30 at the latest, other hotels i've stayed at at least give until 12 or 1pm without an issue. I have stayed at quality inn's before and the room quality and front desk service has always been great. Not to mention the neighborhood is horrible. I will not be staying here again. My advice to anyone looking to book this hotel is just spend the extra 30-40 a night and get yourself a nicer hotel closer to the coast.",

I also noticed that there was a need for more ashtrays on the property because the sidewalk and the bushes were covered with cigarette butts.

People were parked along red curbs, and in fire lanes....I finally parked right in front of the lobby doors just to hop out and ask where in the heck am I supposed to park I was directed to park in front of the pizza place or the Subway in the next parking lot over, as they also own that property. I did find that there were two available spots there. So if I had been even ten minutes later, even this might not have been an option. However, even though I now had a parking spot, I then had to walk over to the hotel, and it was late at night, and I was a female, alone, walking in a neighborhood that I don't know if it was safe or not. I didn't FEEL safe. While checking in, I noticed that they offer to let people leave their cars parked there when they fly out. Which I think is a great thing....if you have the space for it! And it should be something that should be let known to guests booking as well. After the parking fiasco, I was hoping that at least the room would be nice, only to find a hotel room that, while clean, was pretty dingy. But at least the bed was comfy!!",
