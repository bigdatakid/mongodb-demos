Our receipt from hotels.com said there was room service, but there was no room service. We forgot an item, but when we called to see if they found it and could return it, we were told, Sorry, the lost and found is only open M-F, 8-5. Not one employee acted as if we were in any way valued guests. I'm glad we only stayed the one night.

It's overrun with children and likely local guests. The hallways also had a not so fresh scent. My room was very dingy and lacked warmth and much comfort. As someone who enjoys spending time in the hotel room on vacation it was very bleh! Didn't try the dining options - I recommend eating at Main Street Station for the buffet. Casino floor is very smoky. Obviously right at the Fremont experience if that is what you are looking for. Will likely never stay here again.",

    "reviewText": "The room was dated, old furniture and a bit dirty. Our cooler started leaking on to the carpet. Carpet got soggy. Later on, our cooler went out so it was pretty warm in our room. Sunday, the next morning. No hot water. We went to the front desk and let them know. They said they working on the water so a lot of guests didn't have hot water, they said about another hour hot water should be back on. The leaking cooler, they didn't get back to us because, they were going to send someone up to take a look at it, but my husband and son were still sleeping. This is like 8am. So they said let us know when. We left to meet our Realtor. So we didn't let them know and by the time we got back. We were too tired from everything. But at least they could've called our room and asked if we still needed the cooler checked. The had our numbers also. I mean would think that they would note it down on the the computer. No fridge in the room, if you want one, it's 20 a day. No microwave. No view of Las Vegas. The only is concrete walls. If you want a view of Las Vegas. 20 extra. We had to pay 10 to park in the garage, the first time. Later I asked the front desk if we had to pay but, they reimburse us. Later I asked if we had to pay every time we parked in the garage. He said No, just use our room card to go in and out.",
