You could see the sale of drugs inside the hotel. They charged me $93.38 and refunded me $46.59 after 15 minutes that I checked in. They said they have to charge me because I already checked in. Left and whent to Howard Johnson hotel, problem solved. This Crack house is giving bad reputetion to Expedia. The San Antonio police department and health department should take care of this problem.Nothing",
