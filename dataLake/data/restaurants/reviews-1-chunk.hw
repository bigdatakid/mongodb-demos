Service was excellent, the appetizers were tasty and readily available.  The reception meal was very well done, food excellent and service very good.  A breakfast was held in the morning and it was a disaster.  The service was terrible, items ordered never delivered.  Waited an hour before getting two cups of tea, served piecemeal; first I got my pot, minutes later my wife got her pot, and 10 minutes later we got our tea bags.  We waited an hour between our order and the time it was served and my wife never got her toast for her eggs.  The manager came round and apologized for the poor service and said they were just overwhelmed.  With 10 years of experience in Hotel dining rooms and myself serving 12 tables for 3 meals every day as well as being the head waiter; I cannot imagine why everything else was so great and this meal such a disaster.",

I went out of my room and the hall was smokey.  I reported this to the front desk, and they investigated it, but told me there was nothing they could do since they couldn't tell which room it was coming from.  I had to stuff a towel under my door to try and keep the smell out, and it would have been nice if they would have atleast did something to vent the air in the hallway.

And to top it all off I left a pair of sandals in the room and there was NO chance they were left anywhere else and they were never turned into housekeeping.

    "reviewText": "Great little find in the heart of Old Town! We found it online because they accept pets and was near the venue we were attending. Very pet friendly - awesome room and staff. We stayed by chance, but will make it a destination next time. And on Saturday mornings it is right across from a huge farmers market which we loved shopping at. We even found a fun little antique chest from the 1800's and of course great produce! Get there early though because they close the farmers market at 11am.",

    "reviewText": "My family of three stayed at the Hotel Monaco during our sightseeing vacation to Washington DC. The room was magnificent with comfortable beds, a well stocked refrigerator and internet access. We did walk the 11 blocks to the King Street metro station the first day, but on the following 3 days we caught the DASH bus right across the street from the hotel. It cost us $1.25 each and the tickets were good for the whole day, so we could ride back to the hotel also. We would definitely stay at the Hotel Monaco again. The only complaint we have is that for the last 3 nights of our stay, they had no towels at the pool so we had to bring the handtowels from our room.",

But this time, there were weights missing.  There was no jump rope.  And the water cooler was empty.  Not good.  I may consider another hotel next time.",

The front desk staff insisted they were \"on it\" but after 15-20 minutes, still no coffee. The lobby was generally crowded in the mornings as well. Not enough seating for the number of people hanging around - probably waiting for their coffee as well. I like Kimpton properties but this one needs a bit of help from the management.",
