The only thing which was probably out of their control the jacuzzi by the pool with not working due to a storm passing through. But the pool is clean and feeling good. I would definitely stay here again.",

    "reviewText": "This hotel definitely falls short of Hampton standards in several areas. Location - Quite convenient. Right off I-75. close to restaurants, stores. 25 minutes drive to Siesta Key beaches and Lido beaches. Personnel/check in - Average. Overall appearance - The hotel is old and worn out and needs updating. The carpets are worn out and seem dirty. Carpets in some areas of our room were ripped. The restroom in the lobby area was disgusting and worse than a public restroom!! Totally unacceptable. Beds - Acceptable, comfortable. Bathrooms- The bathrooms need to be cleaner. There was mold on the shower curtain on the inside. Water temps and pressure was acceptable. Room - Room lacked storage. No drawers to store belongings. They do have a couple of shelves but are not adequate. Breakfast - Area is very small and does not accomodate normal volumes. Inadequate seating in area. Breakfast items are not replinshed on a regular basis and appeared to be very disorganized. Quality of breakfast items is below average than the Hamptons I have been in in the past. Number of people handling breakfast was very less and were not able to keep up. Juice was watered down including Florida orange juice!! Pool and hot tub - This was good and well maintained and we used it a lot. In general this Hampton falls short in many areas and I do not recommend it.",

It was comfortable and the staff at the desk were nice and so were the staff making the breakfast.",
