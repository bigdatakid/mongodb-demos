He left and an hour later i decided to turn the oven on to fix my dinner, a mouse ran out from under the oven and into a hole near the baseboard of the kitchen. I packed up and called another hotel and checked out within 2 hours upon arrival. the next day while at work i looked down and a roach was crawling on my uniform. on the way home while driving a roach crawled out of my AC duct. Guess they were not happy with their last place of residence either and decided to travel along with me. Need i say they met with unfortunate disaster which resulted in their death.",
