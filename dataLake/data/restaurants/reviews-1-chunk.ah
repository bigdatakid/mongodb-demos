    "reviewText": "My husband and I stayed here for our honeymoon in the beginning of June. We loved everything about this resort. All of the staff were friendly and professional, the rooms were beautiful and very clean, the grounds were also beautiful and clean, and the food and drinks were delicious! In 2014, we stayed at a resort in Punta Cana and were annoyed by how often staff at the hotel and from outside the hotel were soliciting their services, whether for travel, excursions, or for market sales (jewelry, clothing, etc.). At the Excellence Riviera Cancun, not one single staff member pestered us about excursions, traveling, or buying anything that wasn't already provided at the resort. Concierge was located in the main lobby and someone was always on staff to assist with questions about excursions and extra activities at the hotel (romantic dinners on the beach, flower deliveries, etc.) upon your request. Entertainment was provided every night and most of the shows were VERY good. Very few of the live music artists were less than sub par. Upon arriving to the resort, the front desk asked if we were celebrating anything during our stay. When we told them it was our honeymoon, they brought a banner to our room door indicating that we were on our honeymoon and even left romantic decorations in our room after every cleaning. The fact that they took note of our answer and acted upon was a big deal for us, although the service was already amazing before the special honeymoon treatment )",

We upgraded to the excellence club and it was totally worth it, from our own private hammock and bed to our outdoor bathtub, swimming pool and Jacuzzi from the room, fabulous, the food was nothing short of spectacular, I don't think I had one bad meal, and with ten restaurants the choice was outstanding. We were surprised the buffet was not open for dinner but it forced us to try all the great restaurants which you don't need reservations for. We had a couple of small issues which were attended to immediately, our room door was loose causing us to hear a lot of hallway noise and they changed it the same day. One night some rude guests were shouting outside of our room at 3am, one phone call and they were gone in five minutes. It was our anniversary and at no extra charge we received a champagne breakfast in the room and a special decorated table at the restaurant of our choice where we could order off menu if we wanted to. The morning of our anniversary Mario at the buffet brought us a piece if cake with Happy Anniversary written in chocolate on the plate and two candles. That really made us feel special. One of the best all inclusives I have ever stayed at.",

We reserved several swim-up suites, which included their own sun beds and hammocks - a must if you love laying out. There are restaurants and bars to suit every taste, and the choices are all excellent. The property is gorgeous, the people are extremely nice, and I am torn between raving more about this perfect experience and keeping my mouth shut so it won't be crowded when I return. Speaking of crowded - it wasn't. There were a lot of people, and it could be a challenge some days to find a shady spot by the pool, but it never felt crowded or overly full. You could always find a spot on the beach. We were able to eat at every restaurant, no reservations (check dress code ahead of time - we nearly didn't). There were events every night - circus acts, dancers, music groups, parties, etc. The activities are numerous and top-notch (just like everything else here), and so much fun. Travel tip: although check-in is a 3pm and check-out is at noon, if you arrive early and leave late you simply leave your bags with the desk and continue to enjoy the resort. It was heavenly. While this was our first time, and gratuity is included, we did come across a couple of repeat guests who brought a handful of 1s for the staff that went above and beyond. When we return, we'll likely do the same.",

They usually have a rotating lunch buffet at the beach that was always good and all of the themed dinner buffets that we went to had a great array of tasty food. I'm not sure if it was the time of year (end of Oct.) or what but the resort never seemed busy, in a good way. We could always find a spot where no one else was to relax. Around the main pool and bar it was busy but never crowded. We met several people that had been to the resort several times before and we could see why. We are hoping to return in the future.",

I think the chef at these two restaurants are really great. However, there was one Batista at the coffee shop named Melissa - no matter what day u went there she was always very rude and had didn't belong there with rest of the staff who would go above and beyond to ensure great experience. She didn't care how ur drink came out and never even apologized for screwing up the drinksor. she would never even offer to make new once. Another thing I would like to point out is the Photoshop which brings various birds and monkey for people's entertainment. I think this kind of money making things promote animal cruelty and smuggling. Humans (my fellow travelers) should have other better ways for entertainment which doesn't involve a life (soul) that had to be in captivity. Otherwise , it was a very good stay.",

Breakfast buffet was fabulous, anything you would want. My favorite place to eat was the Japanese, did that one twice.

This is our second time staying at an Excellence Resort. As with our experience before, this resort was very clean, food and drinks were great, amenities were great, and the staff was very friendly, kind, helpful, and accommodating. However, I will say the staff at Excellence Riviera Cancun was top notch and really made the experience even better. The staff really goes above and beyond to take care of you at this resort and make you feel welcome. If possible it was very much worth the upgrade to the Excellence club Jr. Ocean Suite. The rooms were very specious and the ocean views were excellent. Quite a few extra perks we got on this trip with the Excellence club upgrade (private check-in/out, private pools and beach, got free spa treatments for both, and club room that you can go to anytime for extra special events). The evening shows were very good and entertaining and activities are there if you want to do more than lie on the beach or at the pool. The dining and restaurant selection on the resort was very good. If you see something extra you want to eat you just order it with your meal. There was nothing that was not included. The only things we had to pay for were gifts or if we ran out of sun screen or needed some sort of medicine (Advil or something like that). Everything you could need is on the resort.",

The outdoor terrace was a bonus outdoor space that we aren't used to having on vacation. We were put in building 4 which we liked and didn't mind the short walk to the restaurants since it gave us a little more privacy and peacefulness being a little further away from the main pool . However just a warning they are doing construction in two or three of the buildings (I believe in building 6 and 7) which did get loud at times while we swam through the lazy river near those buildings (we never heard construction from our room though). Also, another heads up --- there is a MAJOR seaweed problem and no one is allowed to swim in the ocean. They aren't sure when this will pass or if it ever will but the pools are gorgeous and we actually didn't mind not being able to swim in the ocean. We definitely recommend Flavor Market restaurant (Gilberto was amazing!), as well as Chez Isabelle. We also did a couples massage which was great --they do offer discounts once you get there so definitely don't book in advance. Overall, we would definitely recommend this place. It's absolutely gorgeous and every member of their staff was friendly and helpful.",

We stayed 7 days and were not disappointed with ANYTHING! Lots of folks avoided the beach due to the seaweed but this is nature's doing and not Excellence's. However, they tried to remove as much as possible and we got into the warm water despite the ugliness of it and feeling. Once we crossed over the slimy stuff and got out past the seaweed it was good. However, the lazy river, pools, and jacuzzi hot tubs were as great and relaxing. If you are looking for a place that has excellent food (all the restaurants are 5 star and amazingly wonderful), excellent service, super cleanliness, serenity, yet ability to enjoy some water sports, facitlity games, relaxation, outstanding shows in the evenings, no kids ( I love kids but not on my vacation), adult only---- then this is the place for you.

Marcial was incredible especially since it seems like they never had enough waiters at the other pools we visited. He worked so hard and always delivered drinks with a smile. He is a professional (his response any time we told him he was working too hard or being too good to us).

We were expecting to enjoy a week in a quiet resort setting and we were pleased to find that the resort exceeded our expectations in every category. Be aware that the Cancun airport is a hot bed of tour sales and other hucksters who will harass you and deceive you into thinking that they may help you find your ground transportation. Following the hotel's recommendation, we use Season's Tours private car service (you will find the rep on the second platform outside the airport waiting room). Once we connected, everything fell into place. Our driver had cold towels and cold bottled water in a clean, comfortable SUV and within 20 mins, we were greeted with cold champagne and a warm welcome by Gabriella in the main lobby of the resort. Check-in was easy and we were escorted to our suite in building 9 by a wonderful bellman who also gave us a tour of the facility as we walked through. We chose a swim-up suite which included both an indoor and outdoor jacuzzi, a sunning bed steps from the patio and a hammock. The room was clean, comfortable and spacious. The pools was clean and just a few feet from our patio and the beach, which was clean and well kept was a 5 minute walk. We tried almost every restaurant and bar during our 8 days and were never disappointed. Service was excellent by all concerned. Room service was fast and tasty.",

Ofrecen servicio de bebidas y alimentos en la playa y efectivamente existe, pero la persona encargada pasa por la playa cada hora. No tienen servicio de traslado areopuerto-hotel-aeropuerto, hay que contratarlo aparte y el hotel no recomienda a nadie especifico. Parece ser que es algo atipico, pero habia demasiadas algas en el mar, lo bueno es que tenian personal contratado para limpiar la playa todo el tiempo, pero definitivamente no es suficiente.

However the rooms inside are quite modern, neat, tidy. Basic but just what you need for an average priced stay near Lihue. Bed comfortable but some of the pillows had a slight dewy smell to them. Pool and jacuzzi nice. Restaurant small but good selection of meals and staff are very helpful in giving you suggestions of nearby eateries. One washing machine and dryer for the whole place was sometimes a nightmare (although it is free). Parking easy and free. WIFI signal too weak to be used on iPhones when we were in our room, weak signal can be picked up on a laptop. In the lobby the signal is strong and fast. The location of this hotel works well as you have easy access to the north and south. Overall a good comfortable stay, daily maid service was thorough. Hotel has good potential especially when they have finished renovations, established a concierge etc. would stay here again if visiting Kauai",
