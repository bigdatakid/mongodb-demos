This arrogant worker that works at night was telling me she had no more rooms available so I went dont to talk with her and explained that Im not gonna pay to sleep here..then all of a sudden she gave me 2 other rooms to look at, they werent any better. When I got back she stated.that.she.called.the manager and offered me a refund. .we end up getting half of.the money refunded and checked.in at Days Inn which I felt it was well worth the money....BUT this hotel couldnt offer me a 10 day stay for free....ITS THAT BAD..NEVER EVER AGAIN!!!",

    "reviewText": "I needed a cheap place to stay for 3 nights to attend my son's graduation from basic training. This place satisfied that requirement.Pluses: Close to Lackland AFB (7 mi, 10-15 min during low traffic, 45 min during high traffic). Refrigerator in room. Close to restaurants and grocery store (Walmart Supercenter). There is a pool (I didn't use it) and on Fridays, they have a \"fiesta\" with free nachos and 2 free drinks. Also, the staff was very friendly and helpful.Minuses: The elevator was very dirty (I was on the 2nd floor), and it stank when the humidity was high. My room stank when I checked in, but after running the A/C it got tolerable. The mattress was hard, but I can sleep anywhere.Additional info: There seemed to be a lot of families staying there for the same reason as me--cheap and close to base. The parking lot is lighted and monitored by security camera 24/7. I saw kids playing in the pool, people looked happy. I did not feel unsafe, but some people might be scared off by the neighborhood (those used to more high-end places).There are places closer to base, but they were either booked up or more expensive (even the Motel 6 was considerably higher-priced than this place).I would stay here again if my needs were the same (cheap and close to base).",

The kitchen was also filthy. There were no hangers in the closet. I asked the front desk for some, but they never arrived. Although I was staying there for 4 nights, there was one towel and no wash rags. No waste basket in the bathroom. NO BODY EVER CAME TO CLEAN THE ROOM OR MAKE THE BED OR CHANGE THE SHEETS. There was music and noise most of the night. I asked the lady at the desk if she had ever been in one of the rooms to see how dirty they are. She said No. I asked the Security Guard on nights at the desk how often they get broken into, he said \"Not too many\". Yet I see that room 142 had a new door replaced the day after and that there were multiple new doors throughout the complex.I would never stay there or recommend this place to anyone.",

They said the cutoff time for a full refund was 20 minutes. Or at least that's what they told me three days later. It was Saturday and they told me there wouldn't be a manager until Monday morning (I ended up calling Tuesday at noon, no manager showed up on Monday.) Those two hours were spent unpacking the car, debating whether or not we should leave, and above all, taking pictures of the whole mess. I'll be disputing this with my bank.

    "reviewText": "This hotel was very run down, there were no towels in the room when we arrived and after requesting towels it took them almost 1 hour to bring them. Their response was they had no clean ones left and had to wash and dry before bringing. The floors/carpet were very dirty. The kitchenette was very old and moldy, plus the refridgerator was on but did not cool. I would not stay here again. And not easy to locate of the 410 loop, if you miss the exit that is more than a mile before the hotel you will end up traveling more than 5 miles round-about to get back. Very weirdly located. I think this was an old apartment complex and was made into a hotel/motel that needs alot of improvements inside and outside. The pictures that were used to describe the hotel must have been from another hotel, they did not vaguely look like the picture on on this website. BEWARE",

There was one towel in the bathroom and it was paper thin - I'm so glad we brought our own.The TV didn't work at all, and in the \"living room\" there were cables on the wall where a TV should be. The door wouldn't close unless you channeled your inner Hulk and slam it as hard as you can.The people in the room above us had a very impressive stereo system - we could hear them blasting music all night long. Kids are running around everywhere and there's shouting at night. So if sleeping at night really isn't your thing, this is the place for you.Then there's the roaches. They are everywhere, so if you're afraid of bugs (like me!) avoid this place. Ew. Gross.",

    "reviewText": "We picked this hotel as a last resource on a spontaneous trip we took to SA. We saw the low rating but we decided that for one night it really couldn't be that bad. Boy, were we wrong!! When we booked the hotel it said it was the last one available, meaning that all their other rooms were taken. For a hotel that claims to be at full capacity and thus possibly doing well financially, the quality of their rooms is disgusting. We walked into the room and it instantly smelled of cigarette. Nowhere on our booking did it say this was a smoking room. The bedroom furniture was all written on with permanent marker by someone named Chula, who was asking for money. The smoke detectors were broken and hanging from the wall. Some of the outlets you could tell had burned out because they were brown from the outside (we didn't use them.) The bathroom door had a hole in it, there was no toilet paper, or complimentary  soaps. The shower did not work!! Only the bottom part of the shower worked so you had to kneel inside the tub to get any water. The chairs had the cushions fall out. When we finally when to sleep we almost thought there was bedbugs because we saw all these black spots, it turned out to be cigarette droppings. Like really?! The management needs to get their act together and improve the quality of their rooms if they want to continue business in the future.",
