Sorta bummed we couldn't turn it up during the night but no biggie. If we needed anything we didn't have a problem getting it, Towels,Toilet paper, etc. Great location to everything 5- 10 minute walk to anything and everything. Really nice pool and sitting area in courtyard. Overall very nice place to stay.",

We liked it so much that after arriving at the airport and finding our flight was cancelled I immediately rebooked the Lamothe Hotel and dinner reservations at Peche (in that order). Rating is on my satisfaction - I'm giving this 5 stars because it was a great stay but this isn't a 5 star hotel. We stayed in Room 115 which is too close to the back gate and louder than the other rooms but that doesn't affect how much we enjoyed ourselves.",

The small dirty bathroom was also similarly set up - the door wouldn't open completely because of the sink vanity. There was no closet, just a narrow armoire. Getting in and out of the hotel was a huge pain. We discovered BLACK MOLD in the bathroom, and reported it - told it would receive a deep cleaning, but black mold still present afterwards. Requested and was denied a new room. Will never stay again nor recommend anyone else stay there. Neighborhood sketchy despite proximity to major tourist areas. Parking extremely limited and difficult.",
