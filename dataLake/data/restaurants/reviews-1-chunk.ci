All the equipment was tested, and found to be in good condition, and I had a very pleasant stay. I was also pleasantly surprised with a special discount on the daily rate to compensate for the inconvenience. Bravo.",

The air conditioner had an intense musty smell and was probably the original A/C from when the hotel was built. The bathroom had quite a bit of hair on the floor and the grout was dirty everywhere. On the plus side, the sheets were comfortable, good pillows and the A/C cooled the room real well. The breakfast buffet had items, such as, waffles, boiled eggs, muffins, breads, cereal, oatmeal and yogurt, along with coffee, milk, apple and orange juice.
