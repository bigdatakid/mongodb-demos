That evening, I still didn't have clean linen, I slept on top of them again.   I had soap, and towel and washcloth.  The next morning  after I used the new towel, I discovered I had been given a dirty towel that had been used by a woman with red lipstick and long black hair.  I was by myself.  I was never so happy to check out of a hotel.",

The outside door did not closed properly no continental breakfast only coffee. super dirty stairs Never, Never will stay there again. Very expensive.
