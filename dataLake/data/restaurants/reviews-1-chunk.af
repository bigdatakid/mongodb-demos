The main bed was fine but the sofa bed folded out sloping the frame was bent and so making the mattress sloping downwards. We just took the mattress off and put it on the floor. The lanai was sandy so that when you came in from outside, sand was tracked in. Great location for the unit but not much positive other than that.",

    "reviewText": "The location is great in the center of downtown Kona, near the beach, restaurants, etc. The condo is spacious for a stay of two or small family of 3 or 4. The laundry is on site including dryer and washer. This is the plus when I decided to book this property. My only complaints are the noises in the early morning when businesses load their goods and the hidden fee of cleaning service. It was indicated on the confirmation page that additional fee of 50 will be charged by the hotel at check in/out. However, the hotel only informs me at my arrival that I stay more than 3 nights, so the additional fee will be 130 instead of 50. I understand the whole resort/cleaning fee, and I do not mind to pay 130 if I am informed in advanced. I book hotels very frequent and I understand the resort fee usually bases on daily. If not, the property will inform the slum sum amount before customer decide to book or not. At castle kona reef, cleaning happens once a week, so we do not get room cleaning during our stay. Room is not fresh and clean by the end of the day. The kitchen has ants everywhere. The fridge is not extremely clean. Therefore, 130 is a bit too much. I am more than happy to know the fees in advance and decide whether or not staying is worth it. Compare to 5 stars hotel, the cleaning fee is a bit overprice. I do not like and support these type of business with hidden fees.",

They have a beautiful pool and jacuzzi and a great outdoor BBQ cooking area (They cleaned the gas grills every morning). The sunset views from both our lanai and the pool area were spectacular. The room itself was O.K., a little dated, small but functional. We had two adults and two kids, but there was enough room for all. The bathroom and kitchen was well equipped, nothing fancy but adequate. There was always plenty of parking close to the room. The only real negative for me was the occasional slamming of doors from all the units. The inner walkways amplified any voices or footsteps. The noise of guests coming and going could get a little loud in the morning. Overall a great place for a family to stay.",

    "reviewText": "Our Condo was the end unit, B-21, and it was in the worst location in the complex except the unfortunate people below us. It is situated right next to the busy and noisy Ali'i Drive and facing the public beach park with lots of commotion going on at all hours. Our ocean view was a tiny sliver from the Lanai. The view once we stepped out the front door was of cement stairs and the parking lot. The pool is nowhere in sight and a good hike through the complex to where it is actually pretty and you can see the ocean. The unit was hot and the air conditioner was placed at the opposite end from the bedroom which was also off to the side, past the kitchen, laundry and bathroom. We couldn't open the windows because of the traffic noise (motorcycles burning rubber, cars, buses, tour vehicles honking horns and people shouting after weddings etc) and the sun blared through the windows on that side because the blinds were missing at least a quarter of their slats. All the blinds were dirty, stained and broken. The kitchen was nicely appointed with every appliance we needed (after we fixed the burner which was in backwards). The dishwasher rungs were rusted off but otherwise it was decent. I was disappointed that they didn't have salt and pepper, cooking oil and a few spices at least, as I've had in other places but the maids must be instructed to take them home. We found the entrance flooded with dirty water when we returned one day. It came close to ruining our trip.",

The resort has several restaurants that obviously try to be fancy (no buffet, it's all table service), as well as 24-hr room service, but while service was really good we found the food somewhat hit-or-miss, and (perhaps not surprisingly, but a bit disappointing) lacking any authenticity. Same thing can be said of drinks, pina colada was great but margaritas were incredibly sweet, and at breakfast the orange juice decidedly tasted chemical, not quite fresh. We actually went outside the resort specially to be able to try some real Mexican food! If you don't have a car there is not much around, although there are great snorkeling places within 15 min drive (valet parking is free, which is very convenient). Overall we had a really good time, but I don't think we will be back (first time at an all-inclusive resort, so I can't compare to the competition though)",

    "reviewText": "We had a wonderful stay at Dorado. The service level was excellent and the food was great! We had some worries since there had been some bad reviews about the food, but it was high quality and European style of cooking (e.g. not American fast food-style). The hotel was peaceful and calm, with very beautiful surroundings. The beach-beds are fantastic! The negative: the hotel shop was ridiculously overpriced as well as purchasing of winebottles at the restaurants. House wine was included in the all inclusive-deal, but other wines were not and were only available per bottle.",

There were so many wonderful and romantic restaurants to choose from we didn't even eat at all of them. The room we stayed in was a bit dated but still so well taken care of that it didn't matter at all. Would DEFINITELY go back to this or any other Karisma resort.",

Quiz la nica mejora es el tiempo de espera en los restaurantes para que traigan los alimentos... Es comprensible por la dedicada preparacin de la comida, sin embargo en ocasiones fue excesivo.",

    "reviewText": "Let me just say I will never book thru Expedia ever again. I checked in on 4/16/15 and checked out on 4/22/15 and let me say I want a refund or to be put up for what I originally paid for the El Dorado Royal. On 2/8/15 I booked thru Expedia and paid in FULL for 6 nights/7 days all inclusive at the Royale. On 4/8/15 exactly 60 days I get an email from Expedia stating that the Royale is overbooked by 17 reservations and I will be moved to Generations resort. That is a problem because I booked originally Adults Only and Generations has kids. The only other sister property available was Seaside Suites so I went on Karisma's website and it appeared to be similar. We arrive on 4/16/15 and the rooms are small older resort that what was expected but fine. The sewer/moldy smell from water retention outside our door was gross. I complained to personal concierge and they acted as if it wasn't an issue. Interesting enough people we met and check in on same day got moved to building because it was so bad and they even tried a dehumidifier. We never got offered a move, etc. Our 2nd full day we both came down very ill with diarrhea, vomiting and dehydration. We at first just said oh maybe it's Mexico. No, we finally saw the doctor on site and were given an antibiotic, bacterial medication and pain med for stomach. Our friends we were traveling with too were so sick and others in resort we met at well from Canada, Australia, Philadelphia, California, etc. There is something not right. The",
