The rooms looked decent online but once you enter the actual room it is a whole different experience. The room smelled of mildew, the stove, fridge, and shower were broken. The furniture is very old fashioned, the couch showed wear and tear, and the bed was very squeaky. I was to stay 2 nights at this hotel but I cut my stay short because I could not stand staying in this hotel any longer.",

    "reviewText": "During the beginning check in- everything looked very quaint and as if it had a decent amount of value. It appeared as if it were very clean. I went out and had dinner- came back- relaxed,  all was well.  I was enjoying an infrequent bit of quiet time away from my soon to be ex-wife.  However,  during my sleep,  I was caused to awaken very abruptly because I felt something crawling on me. Not only where they're very small roaches in the bed, but I found some on the walls of the bedroom.  This caused me to get up- leave my keys on the coffee table and go home...... crazy at home is preferable  to crazy at a hotel.  The staff was very nice- extremely  personable and friendly.  However I don't believe there was anything they could have done at that point that would have made me comfortable. So I left.",
