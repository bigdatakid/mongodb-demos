    "reviewText": "The staff was incredibly nice and accomodating however, the hotel was less than pleasant. Only two of the lights worked, there were no trashcans, there was trash underneath of the bed, the bathroom was disgusting, there was a layer of what I'm hoping was just dust covering the entire ceiling, the door did not shut all of the way and it was just above all a ver displeasing experience. The staff was great, like I said, and gave me no issues when I checked out early/cancelled the rest of my reservation. I would never stay here again or reccommend to a friend. The photos online were WAY better than the actual hotel itself.",

It was definitely placed on our list of do not stay at again hotels.",
