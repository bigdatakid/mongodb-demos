The orange juice burned our throats fro the acidity. They had a cardboard like of the man in the advertisents. Now everytime I see his likeness I will run away.",

I would rather stay in a Walmart restroom for a week than another 2 minutes in this sketchy dump. It's cheap for a reason. Don't let that fool you... More",
