The woman at the desk was very sweet and explain all details of the hotel. She even directed me to where my room was going to be. The rooms were very clean and had alot of space. Love the fact that the room came with a stove and fridge. The hotel is located in a very good location. Where it was easy to find places to eat and shop. Loved my stay here at the Fiesta Inn. Oh and the breakfast bar was wonderful!!!!",

I can assure you that if we book through Expedia again and we draw this motel we will cancel our reservation and go else where. This was quite a disappointment after our past experiences be so completely opposite.",
