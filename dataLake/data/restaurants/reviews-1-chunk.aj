    "reviewText": "We stayed at this resort about 5 years ago and it was one of those vacations that we as a family loved and continued to talk about as a special place. We always mentioned it as a possible vacation as we all wanted to go back. We planned the trip and confirmed three rooms as our kids had friends coming with them. When we arrived our room wasnt ready (we were early). But they were having trouble finding three rooms let alone 3 rooms close together. The front desk manager came out and asked us to go into one of the villas at montechristo. This was an upgrade but we were hesitant because we had no idea about the room set up and the distance. The manager assured us we would be just as close as the building we were in before. We were also promised 200 off resort charges. The villa was beautiful but we were as far away as could be. We had to call for a shuttle which frequently took 10-15 minutes just to get to the edge of the resort then walk or ride a golf cart to the pools and restaurants. We had an hour wait on a shuttle one night trying to return to our villa. When I went in to complain, I was told that there was only one shuttle for 4 adjacent resorts. Room service was never less than an hour because they had the same issues in getting to us. The distance was a big problem and I feel the front desk was very misleading just to get us to solve their problem. At checkout, no one could find where the manager had given us the resort credit(it was written on a voucher we presented)",

My wife got sick 1 day but cant really say if was from the hotel food since we had gone into town to try the local food. Cannot go into the ocean at this resort but you can at their sister hotel Pueblo Bonito Rose, we went 1 day but the ocean is really rough and not good for little kids. My older daughter and I did swim in the ocean but it wasn't easy. I would visit this hotel again in the future.

It is high pressure marketing to buy into their properties from the moment you arrive until departure time. Even after we saw the presentation, before calling up a cab for us to go to town, the staff would ask us if we'd seen the presentation and made us feel uncomfortable to leave the property. The is a complete lack of consistency throughout the hotel, the food would come out differently each time. For example one night we ate at the Japanese restaurant and really enjoyed it so we returned only to be very disappointed. We had to ask several times for ginger and wasabi and never received it, our order was completely wrong and the food was not nearly as good. That night we asked for bottled water (we had the all inclusive plan) and the bartender would only give us one each - that only happened at one of the pool bars near our room. The hotel is inconveniently located quite far from town and although the beach is beautiful there it is not swimmable. The staff did not seem well traveled and many of them could come across as indifferent or rude at times. Beautiful on the surface but lacking in quality of product.",

My family enjoyed this resort because the amenities were on point, amazing food drinks etc, but I love the water, so if I could I would have been in the ocean the entire time. Just depends on what you like. And since the resort is basically on the side of the mountain, you have to take golf carts everywhere, which were no big deal. But again, it depends on what you like.

    "reviewText": "The property is massive so to go anywhere you have to be picked up by a golf cart and driven to where you want to go. Most of the time waiting 10 minutes or more. The air conditioner in our room went out at 3am, they didn't fix out till almost 5 and it was very hot and humid. No mini bar or anything in the room upon arrival so you have to order room service to get anything. The service at the pools is terrible, sometimes waiting 30 minutes at the pool bar to get a drink and the bar wasn't even busy. If you do all inclusive you're treated terribly, they see that band on your wrist and they ignore you because they think you're not going to tip. We ended up leaving this place a night early and going to another hotel in Cabo because the service was so bad.",

Loved their prsonality and willness to go the extra mile. The grounds were very well kept and the workers all took pride in their job. We had one incident that repeated itself everyday. There were 4 of us in a junior suite, we had to request more towels EVERY day..One day we didin't get any. The housekeeper would only leave 2 wash cloths, handtowels and bath towels when she did. We were ther for 6 days. Other than that, grat place for vacation. We bought in and will definitely be returning. Ole!",

    "reviewText": "CONS: The front desk was business with a smirk not a smile. This resort is built alongside the non-swimmable beach of Cabo. The views are magnificent but the currents are so strong that you absolutely positively can not get close. YOU WILL DIE NO MATTER HOW GOOD OF A SWIMMER YOU ARE! Four people died in it last month alone! This resort is also build on a huge property alongside a mountain/hill. You will be totally exhausted if you want to walk to any of it's main locations. Fortunately they have drivers driving golf carts to take you everywhere on the property and they are very accessible. The problem is that they also pollute the air with the gasoline smell, which is not very pleasant. Their driveway from start to the lobby is about a 5-7 minute drive. What makes it unpleasant is the entire road is made of beautifully laid pavers which make for a very bump ride. Because this resort is away from the main action (swimmable side of the beach, which I found is still not very swimmable), they have a free shuttle, which was always full, to take you to and from their sister hotel called Rose. I had to pay 14 each way twice to go to the beach. Ana at Rose didn't give a **** that the shuttles couldn't accommodate extra people needing a ride to/from the resort. She refused to be of any assistance saying I was the other hotel's problem. The solution was to book in advance which was still always booked. Anyway, the food was mediocre and very expensive for what you got.",

I called a few weeks ahead of our stay to check on the reservation and it was then that I was informed of the change. But managing a wheelchair across a gravel parking area with standing water plus maneuvering on a narrow sidewalk and a big step to get into the villa unit would have been quite difficult. The door stuck and was extremely difficult to open and close. Sometimes we couldn't even get it locked. There was a broken window in the kitchenette, broken blinds, cleanliness issues, only straight hot water in one of the showers...yikes! This place was not as represented, even after talking to a clerk at the front desk. We had to leave due to our concerns of the safety issues but Expedia worked with us and refunded our money.
