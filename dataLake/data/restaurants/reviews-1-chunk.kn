We arrived and were told our room was not ready. Not only was it not ready, but the guest before us had been smoking in a non-smoking room during his extended stay. We waited 30 minutes for another room to be cleaned to find out it also smelled horrible. The smell of smoke was so strong we kept the window open for the two days we were there. The front desk did not seem to be phased by this inconvenience regarding the smoke. We will never stay at that hotel again.",
