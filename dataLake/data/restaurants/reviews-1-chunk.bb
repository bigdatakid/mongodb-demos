Building was secure with key cards at all entries. Hotel room was clean. Families stayed there and it was pretty quiet. It is no frills so don't expect the fancy toilet paper and pancakes for breakfast ( unless you make them), but you can save money for your family by cooking pizza in the stove or pasta on the range, use the microwave, fridge ( w/Ice tray) and the dishwasher. The manager was very hospitable and friendly and we liked her a lot. There were a few things wrong with our room and she did her best to make the situation right and we appreciated it.

When we went to the room the linen was full of hair. We called the front desk and they were very accommodating and gave us a new set but at this point we were very disappointed . The hotel is also only 3 floors and it took what felt like forever for the elevator to come. Over 10 minute waiting time on average . They don't have any other elevators and were transporting the garbage on the same elevators as the guests which stunk the elevator up like a garbage disposal. When we needed to get any dinnerware we had to ask at the front desk because the room had none and we had to wait for it to be washed because apparently they don't have any clean ones readily available. We will not be staying at this extended stay hotel ever ! It's sad because the front desk staff was extremely nice as well.",

The hotel is close to Kennedy Space Center and Port Canaveral Cruise Lines.  It is only a 45 minute drive to many Orlando Theme parks.   I would strongly recommend this Titusville hotel to anyone driving by or staying in Titusville for the space shuttle launches.",
