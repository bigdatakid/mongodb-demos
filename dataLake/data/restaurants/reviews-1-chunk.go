    "reviewText": "I stay at the Travelodge everytime I go to Durango, I have never had a problem. This time was no different. The room was clean, as usual. It is the best location, not in downtown but near everything. The only issue I had was the outlet nearest the bed only one worked. So I had to pick between charging my phone and the lamp however, lighting is not scarce in the hotel room.",

I was pleasantly surprised how clean and nice the bathroom was. I always bring sheets and pillows of my own because I'm such a germ-o-phobe but it was actually pretty nice, and the guy at the counter, Austin i think, was very helpful. It was way too much for what it is but maybe that's just Durango supply and demand.",
