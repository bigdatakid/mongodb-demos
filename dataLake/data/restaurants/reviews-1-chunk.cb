When you have a lot of out of town guests, that's an important factor. And the location of the Inn is so convenient to other hotels if more rooms are needed. It is also within walking distance of bars, restaurants, museums, etc. David, the owner, was absolutely fantastic to work with! Phenomenal customer service!!

    "reviewText": "I would recommend Fort Conde again because it was a beautiful location, the inn rooms were gorgeous and the people we worked with were extremely flexible with us and easy to work with. However, I will say that it ended up costing a lot more than we were expecting and I would warn others to think of all the external costs involved. To gain the privacy of the entire facility, you do have to rent out the whole place. Also, you have to rent and obtain vendors for everything else you do there. Nothing is really included. So, you will need to consider sound, lights, tents, chairs, catering, decorations etc. They do include a wedding event coordinator which I considered a bonus at the time but learned too late (on the wedding day) that there is a difference between a coordinator and a planner. She wasn't as adept at keeping the wedding day as organized, put together and stress free as I was expecting or hoping for it to be. Despite that, everything turned out beautiful. We enjoyed having the rehearsal dinner and the wedding ceremony out in the streets under the trees. It was very hot! I think fans or some kind of cooling system would have been a great idea. You do have to buy the alcohol from them but their rates were not bad at all and they were more than willing to go and buy more alcohol when we ran out. They serve a brunch in the mornings for all the guests which is wonderful! Guests who aren't staying there could also join us for brunch but the cost for them was a little steep. Overall, the wedding was gorgeous. The owner was easy to work with and extremely flexible with us. I appreciated his responsiveness. There were other people that worked for him initially that weren't as professional or as responsive.",

Communication was a bit difficult to through email and phone, but improved once it got closer to the wedding. Even though we had these issues, the day of the wedding made those issues obsolete.
