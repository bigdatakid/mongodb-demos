The owner george You is a money greedy pig, during the entire year we rented the house, he kept pestoring us about all the little things. However, he was never there when the house needed a fix. We kept the house in reasonable condition. All the damages are normal wear and tears. At the end of the year however, George subtracted over 70 of our deposit money for completely bs charges such as 900 dollars to wash carpet. ARE YOU KIDDING ME. I don't know why there are good reviews about this man, he is obviously a money hungry pig, the good reviews are perhaps written by himself.",

But again, it was not bothersome. Perfect for my needs!",
