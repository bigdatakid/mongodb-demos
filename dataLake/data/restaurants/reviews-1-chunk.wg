The man at the desk assured me the food was good and he was dead on. When I commented I had been traveling since 3 am and it was now 9pm he told me not to worry. he put me in a room with no neighbors and on the top floor so I would be sure to have quiet. Its little stuff like that. The entire stay was filled with a great friendly staff that never hesitated to anticipate what I would want before I did. Coffee was always hot and breakfast was good. This will be my new place to stay when in town.",
