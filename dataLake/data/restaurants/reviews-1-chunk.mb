I was afraid of catching an STD from the burnt comforter. The staff was ridiculously rude and the lobby reeked so badly of mold I had to hold my breath. I'm asking for my money back.",

The room was small, and shabby, but it was almost midnight and the area that the hotel was in did not look bad, I said OK to the room.  They only gave us one towel, and no washcloth, my husband went to ask for more and they only had one to give us.  The sheets were wrinkled and gray, and I saw a cockroach in the bathtub.  There also were very poor patch jobs done on the walls where someone had knocked a hole in the wall, and the next door neighbor had what sounded liked a big and vicious dog.  On the second night there, we saw 7 cop cars when we got back from our evening activities, and about 1:00 a.m. there was a knock on our door.  We did not answer it and someone knocked again.  This time my husband said \"who is it?\" and there was a bit of a commotion outside the door and no one answered.  I called the front desk and told them what was going on and the person who answered the phone said \"It might have been the SWAT team, there is a bit of a situation going on here, they may want you to evacuate and come to the front office.\"  Then he put me on hold and came back to the phone and said \"no you are in a different part of the hotel, just stay put and call me if anyone comes to your door again.\"  We later heard what sounded like gun shots, about 5 times.

We had to ask for extra towels each night. I was really upset when I went to take a shower and all that went down. I did like the swimming area and the employees were pleasant.",
