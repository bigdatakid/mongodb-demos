The pool was decent and I think it was heated at night. The room was not the best, it was somewhere to sleep and put our stuff, is what it was. Nothing fancy or extra AT ALL. the sheets had a hole and they were not changed everyday. And there wasn't even an actual comforter on the bed. We had to febreeze it( it had a stale smell) and I wiped down the room myself when we got there.( for my own assurance) But we still stayed for 4 nights 5 days. We went to target,radio shack, a little grocery shopping and the mall (with Dave and busters) ect. and the furthest we ever drove was still less then 10 mins. And the beach and broad walk was a half a mile down the street. I personally would never choose to stay here again but it wasn't the worst either. Like I said it was somewhere to stay and so affordable (under our normal hotel budget) and location wise, it was great, we were in the middle of everything. We'll just say it wasn't nearly bad enough to get in the way of enjoying our vacation.",

The room was clean and well-appointed and all rooms have balconies overlooking the ocean with the hallway providing panoramic windows to look out to the west. The only real distraction was that the construction type of the building and the heaviness of the doors and spring action needed to shut the doors meant that you heard every door on the floor close very clearly and you could hear noises from the room next door. It doesn't seem like much except that everything else is quite silent. It is why I only give the comfort level a 3 out of 5 as it is hard to get comfortable when you hear doors slamming shut all of the time.",
