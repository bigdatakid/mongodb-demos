    "reviewTitle": "Decent but worth $20 to stay in a better hotel",
    "reviewText": "The rooms were pretty clean, the beds didn't look inviting but were comfortable, and the pool was nice. The breakfast was OK. The entire hotel could use some maintenance/upkeep. The room I was in faces a busy street so there was some traffic noise, and there may be safety/security concerns for some guests. The room door opens to the outside, and there's about a 2-3 minute walk through the parking lot (no paved footpath) to go to the office or the pool from the room. The staff wasn't that friendly I'd guess they get customers trying to push the rules frequently. They wear ribbons and get stars if customers write a good review, but the scheme seems a bit forced. Overall, the hotel was decent, but I wish I'd paid another 20 to stay in a nicer hotel.",

    "reviewText": "We were visiting family and wanted something better than the typical 19 motels but didn't want to spend waterfront money. It's a decent place. A little loud at night. The bed was ok but the sheets and covers were annoying. It's older and could use with some renovation, but you'd pay more.",

Lily did a wonderful job keeping my room tidy and left adorable towel animals in my room and bathroom. The continental breakfast was sufficient for my needs. The entire staff was friendly and helpful. If I am in this area again I will stay at Vista Hotel again.",

My only complaint would be that the elevator near my room was broken, without any signs confirming it and exiting back onto US 19 was a little of a pain but that comes with being a highway. If the elevators had been working/had a sign stating it was out of order I probably would have gave the overall 5/5.",
