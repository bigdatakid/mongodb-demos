So fehlen Gelder fr Renovierungen und Personal. Die Terrassen sind moosbelegt, Treppengelnder rosten, die Gartenanlage wird nicht ausreichend gepflegt, berall liegen abgestorbene Pflanzen und Baumaterialien. Der Boden im Frhstcksraum ist einfacher Beton und sehr schmutzig. Das Frhstck ist sehr einfach und das Kchenmobiliar ist verschlissen, z.B. Vllig verrostete Herdplatten. Trotz allem ist die Anlage recht individuell und die Deluxe-Bungalows sind schn. Preis-Leistung stimmt u.a. aber gar nicht.",

Staff was very helpful althought I do have problems trying to get extra pillow during the night time as they told me I can only get it in the morning as the house keeping is not avail at night. Not too far away from the main area although a little bit of travelling to reach is a must. The resort is kinda smack in the middle of the main area on both side but will need transport to reach. Quite during the night with a bar just opposite the resort for those who wants to grab a quick drink will be great. All in all it's good enough to make it a pleasant stay.",
