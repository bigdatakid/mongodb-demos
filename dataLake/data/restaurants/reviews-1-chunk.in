The tub/shower faucet blew off it's pipe, resulting in a horizontal spray, making the shower totally unsable, grest timing if your trying to get an early start. We had a problem adjusting the temperature up 2 degree. Hardly seems like the same place.",

You could opt to park at the City Market a few blocks away or the parking lot behind the Two Rivers convention center to get away from this fee. These are the only hotels in the Grand Junction/Fruita area that charge parking that I know about. Now that I've gotten the bad out of the way, let me talk about the good. I've stayed in about 6 hotels in the area and this was certainly one of the nicest. Many of the others advertise their beds as being Queen size but they're typically Doubles. This hotel has true Queen size mattresses. It's fairly clean, in a nice area, and close to many little mom pop restaurants on Main St. It is also within walking distance to the train station.",
