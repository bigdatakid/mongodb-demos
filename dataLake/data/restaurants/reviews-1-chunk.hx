I knew it was well located to going out and about in Old Town Alexandria but there is also an airport shuttle and people were very helpful in getting more information about transportation to Washington etc. I got a great rate on Hotels.com so that made it more worth it. I would pay the regular prices if I was only going to be there for a few nights but if you can get the rate for better it really stands above the other local options like the Holiday or Comfort Inn. I was very impressed with the high quality.",

    "reviewText": "I had used Hotel.com points for a discounted room and had read somewhere online that when you book with points or free nights that hotels give you there worst room. I believe it now. My room was tucked away in the farthest corner with a view of the dirty rooftop. There was a humming sound coming from outside that I didn't know would become irritating while sleeping. One set of friends had to move rooms because they didn't have hot water. The next morning they ordered breakfast through room service and gave up after 1 1/2 hours of no breakfast. I found out during the night that my room had no heat. When I first checked in, I just dropped my bags in the room and left to meet my group, so didn't notice that there was a problem. I returned late in the evening and it was cool in the room so adjusted the thermostat thinking it would heat up while I was sleeping. No such luck, at 3 am I woke up and it was 63 degrees in my room. Since I didn't want to deal with an engineer at that time of night, I bundled up, cranked the thermostat to 84 went back to bed. At 6:30, I gave up, showered and went down to the lobby where it was warm to await by friends. When I checked out, I told the clerk that they should check the heat since I had the thermostat cranked to 84 and it was still only 63 degrees. I was given a $7.50 breakfast for my trouble.Thank god I had a discounted rate, this hotel is expensive for what it is and what it offers. And why no coffee in the rooms?",

She offered no apology and failed to give me the correct pool hours, which I learned of after i visited the pool ready for a swim only to learn that it was closed for four hours midday.

This was our second time staying with the hotel and it was just as good as I remembered from two years ago. Unfortunately this stay much much shorter:(.We arrived just about when complementary wine hour began. Had just enough time to get to our room, freshen up and have a couple of glasses of vino. I enjoyed the merlot while my DH have the white (didn't notice what kind). The red was wonderful!Our room was nice and very clean. The only issue was the mini bar fridge wasn't working. After notifying the front desk, they sent someone right on it while we were out for dinner.Morning coffee is excellent, however I wish coffee was in the room for better convenience. Thank goodness I had someone willing to go downstairs and get some to bring back to the room.While staying, there were two weddings going on and lots of people dressed in suits and so on... I felt a little intimidated only because we weren't dressed to the nines. While sitting in wine hour, the lobby got very crowded and loud with the wedding parties but we were able to score a spot, find a place for dinner and do a little yuppie watching.All in all, this place is great! The location can't be beat and it's not too pretentious.",

Before it stopped altogether the hotel engineer came in and said that it needed replacing. It took 2 calls to get room service to call me back after they said they would call in a minute (I waited 30 mins).

On the 3rd night of our stay our AC broke in our room (and there was a loud party in the room next to ours). We called the front desk and they switched rooms for us pretty quickly. They even gave my son some toys to play with while we packed and did the swap. The location is amazing. Great restaurants around and plently of places to walk to.

In the spirit of full disclosure, I did not bring this up with anyone until I was checking out. I was only staying for 2 nights and only needed the iron 1 of the mornings. My other negative was - while I was toweling off after my morning shower, I noticed a long strand of dark hair hanging off my shoulder. This was a bit gross as it clearly wasn't mine - I am pretty much bald with only a bit of \"peach-fuzz\" on the sides, which is mostly grey. It clearly must have come off the towel, which makes you wonder a bit about their laundry regime. Although, it could also have come off the cleaning staff when they were replacing the towels in the room. Either way a little \"icky\" from my perspective. However, when I brought the iron and bath tap issue up with the front desk attendant at check-out he was very apologetic and \"comped\" me a night of valet parking.",

Attentive staff.Location is unexpectedly fantastic. King street Alexandria can be toured on foot end to end, full of boutiques and restaurants. Alexandria has historic homes and the riverfront parks, plus the running/cycle path from DC to Mount Vernon runs right through it.Also worth noting is you are in DC in 15 mins by car, or you can take the free shuttle down king street to the metro.The only minor complain is a noisy AC in the room, and thats nitpicking really.",

The only thing that kind of got in my nerves is parking. They do not offer free parking! As far as I remember, you will have to pay 10 dollars a day for internet access.",

The valet service was perfect; they remembered us and my car was outside without a wait, even though the hotel was totally booked. I mentioned that we were celebrating my mother's birthday when we checked in. When we returned from an outing there was a bottle of wine and a chocolate dessert waiting for us. It was the most personal experience I have had in a long time and I travel extensively. The location is perfect for eating, shopping and access to the metro, if you are interested in touring DC.",
