Some of the towels had marks on them that made us think they shouldn't be used anymore. The hotel guide in the room was not helpful at all. The tv guide in the room guide was completely wrong. The wifi is terrible, couldn't even send an email or watch netflix. However, the bed was comfy and clean and we got a good night's sleep over all.",
