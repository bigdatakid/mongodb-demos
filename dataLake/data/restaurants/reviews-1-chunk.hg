    "reviewText": "We hugely enjoyed this holiday. We had not been to Sicily before and this was an excellent base for exploring several parts of the island - including some beautiful sites, all the more so for being decked in spring flowers. The Greek temples at Selinunte and Segesta were especially impressive as were the Roman mosaics at Piazza Armerina, although it was almost 3 hours drive over the mountains in the centre of the island to the latter. We also very much enjoyed the food - the seafood was excellent (even if ultimately disappointing in Porticello, where much is landed from the boats). There are several good restaurants near the hotel including La Brasiera and (more expensively) La Caseta de la Nonna. In short, we can't wait to return to Sicily and visit some other areas. The hotel very much suited our needs, and as part of a package deal (with flights and hire car) was very good value. Driving around Palermo is quite challenging and we advise full insurance cover as it is rare to see a car without scratches down the side. Top tip: make sure you have a map to the hotel from the airport or a sat nav as without this (as we discovered in a torrential rain storm) it is very hard to find your way around the outskirts of Palermo with its many one-way streets. The hotel has secure parking (at an extra cost) and rooms have air conditioning or heating. Careful if you leave your windows open as there are Mosquitos (in the spring at least).",

    "reviewText": "L'albergo gode della condivisione degli spazi e delle strutture con il complesso Officine/Stanze Baronali luogo adibito spesso a matrimoni e cerimonie. L'ampio cortile-giardino da la sensazione di essere quasi in una villa di campagna anche se si in piena citt. Tranquillit, ambiente rilassato e solare e dimensioni ampie delle stanze sono sicuramente tra i maggiori elementi a favore. Davvere instabile la connessione internet wifi alla quale ho potuto per sopperire egregiamente con quella LAN tramite cavo. Migliorabile la pulizia nelle camere. Sempre molto gentile tutto il personale e lo staff dell'albergo con una menzione speciale per il cordialissimo ed infaticabile cameriere dell'area prima colazione. Brerakfast di buon livello per qualit e quantit. Ci torner con piacere.",

    "reviewText": "When we arrived at our hotel room after a very long journey, we were really disappointed with our room. The decor is in dire need of updating, as well as the bathroom. The hotel prides itself on water conservation but there was an archaic hot water tank in the bathroom and we had to wait for water to be heated up before we could all have showers. Breakfast was in a better place but in a separate building and the courtyard made up for the grim rooms.",

    "reviewText": "Disappointing aspects, first room offered was modern very clean with plasma TV but very small, and around the back of the hotel. We asked to change rooms , staff was excellent and gave us another !! This room a little dated from the first but still very clean and larger, the TV was at least 20 years old and didn't work properly, the fridge didn't work either both reported to staff who sent someone round who just pulled the plugs out Room was cleaned first class every day. Rooms have no windows only glass doors overlooking concrete wall of underground car park which was over shadowed by the largest high rise social housing complex peering over at you. Breakfast was very very basic, but again the staff were first class. The so called bar area was never open so you had to order a drink through the reception. Dinner at the restaurant was next door But only if there was not a wedding going on as this area was always being let out. A small area by the car park was the only seating area to relax. This hotel is mainly used for functions and short stay groups on excursions. The photo used to advertise through Expedia is deceptive as it is not the hotel but the venue used for the weddings. Had we known this we would not have stayed there.",

The room was a bit dark and the bed not very comfortable (old mattress smaller than the frame) but I had view on the nice garden, which is what I was looking for. The breakfast was nice and you can ask the staff a real coffee (the one at the machine is not very nice). The staff was very nice and helpful, speaking English and French as well.",

Aspetto esterno trasandato, erano in corso le opere di rifacimento area verde (io l'avrei fatto in primavera) Ci riteniamo abbastanza solari e di dialogo, difatti Giardiniere e figlio (franco e danilo) persone splendide, eduate e simpatici, al contrario quello che pensiamo fosse uno dei soci con la barba, alto e magro....beh in sostanza almeno salutare visto che abbiamo portato guadagno. Ci hanno permesso il check-out nel pomeriggio, gentili....ma 50 in pi mi sembra troppo Scarsa la qualit della colazione ma la cameriera Francesca molto graziosa. Non ci torniamo",
