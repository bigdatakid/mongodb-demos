My air conditioner was not working properly, I also ask if they had a microwave to use and was told no, we don't have a microwave. I've stayed here before in the penthouse which was great and the reason I checked backed in this hotel. This time wasn't so great, I got a standard room. Valet parking attendance was wonderful and welcoming, they did a great job!",
