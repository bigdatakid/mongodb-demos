My mom and I both felt like our necks were sore from the pillows after sleeping there. The hotel did have a breakfast that was fine. The hotel was right off the freeway and not much was right there, but we drove about 10 minutes and found a small historic area for dinner. Overall we would have rated the hotel higher if the staff had been friendlier and more customer service minded. We had to ask for a few things and it felt like they were not happy to help, like it was a chore to bring a box of Kleenex, for example.",

After the pool closed for the evening, the atmosphere was quiet. We felt safe and secure during our stay. Our space was more than adequate for our stay. Our Wi-Fi was sketchy one day, but we didn't really need it, so we didn't ask for help. There was a computer in the lobby that we could have used, too. That is a nice amenity. The TV channels could have been expanded a little. (We didn't use the pool because of the screaming children, but that's what kids do. I would assume that this is a family-friendly hotel!!!

Tables and other furniture was in dis-repair. Shower and bathroom, while appeared to be clean was just dingy and worn. No extra plugs for electronics to recharge. The wi-fi, though free was constantly cutting out and in. Seriously for the per night Rate I was not expecting a heck of a lot more, but some of the repairs (drawer handles that were falling off, loose toilet) could be taken care of without too much effort.
