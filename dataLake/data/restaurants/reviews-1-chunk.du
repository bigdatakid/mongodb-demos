This hotel used to offer free parking and now since it's been renamed 'the Kinney' they only offer valet parking for 15. Not super expensive but I would have liked it to be free as I booked it when it was The Inn at Marina Del Rey which offered free parking. The only thing that was not great was the fact that the lobby, corridors and some common areas were under construction. The front desk area smelled of fresh paint and there were constantly workers around. Breakfast was surprisingly good, with scrambled eggs, bacon and a waffle station, with a very nice lady attendant. This hotel was about 15 minute walking from Venice beach and restaurants located next to it.",

The room was old but clean and the bed looked comfortable however I never had a chance to lay in it. The next 2 hours I tried to focus on work over the smell of food cooking and trains honking near building. It was a long day for me and I needed rest for an important meeting the next morning. Not to take a chance I asked the front desk if I could cancel and get a refund. She was very nice, professional and acknowledged that it was a loud night for the trains. Offered me a room on the other side of the building, but this would put me a stones throw from the highway. Considering I was already short on rest and needed to be on my best for next morning meeting, that was not an option. The Holiday Inn front desk told me there was nothing they could do because I booked my room through Hotels.com. I contacted Hotels.com and they told me there was nothing they could do because the hotel already had my money. This is the part of the story that really got me upset. Someone is lying and neither side took any steps to improve the situation, just passing it to the other party. I've happily used Hotels.com over the years and will not again. I'll do my best to advertise my experience.",

The tile floor in one of the elevators was cracked and falling apart. The other elevator was missing the covers for the lights in the ceiling so the flourescent tubes were all exposed. The elevators were very slow and creaked alot. The carpet in the hallway in front of my room needed to be vacuumed very badly and it remained unvacuumed the whole time I was there.
