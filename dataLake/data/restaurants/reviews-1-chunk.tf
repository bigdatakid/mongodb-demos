    "reviewText": "The front desk did not acknowledge us even when we wanted to check in, and did not acknowledge us for the entirety of our stay, the only time they even bothered to look up from their phones or laptops was when my boyfriend walked in with his Navy Uniform, they thanked him for his service and continued whatever they were doing. The woman who cleaned our room was very friendly, and our room was cleaned every day of our stay, regardless of what time we left the hotel. The tub had a hard time draining, but all other appliances worked well. The room only smelled strange when the AC was left off for too long. The area is next to a couple of small shopping centers. Over all, it was not a terrible stay but I will probably not be returning.",
