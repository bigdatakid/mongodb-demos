We made reservations for 2 stays during this trip. one night before our trip to Gatlinburg and one night on our return. we were disappointed both stays. We chose this hotel because of the location, the pool and the hot tub. The pool was so cold both nights (about a week apart) that we couldnt swim. There were other hotel guests also complaining, so it wasnt just us. The hot tub on the first night kept tripping a breaker. Which is a scary thing. The second night we had the attendent to see about getting the pool warmer, and to inform them the hot tub would not turn on and there were lots of bugs in it. She called the manager who stated that he just cleaned the pool and added water and it would take awhile to warm up. ( there were bugs and objects on the bottem of the pool). and that the hot tub was just checked and cleaned. Not Possible. We make several trips a year to Metropolis/ Paducah and have stayed here. If this is the way to please your guests we will be staying somewhere else from now on!!!",

Room had a HUGE bathtub, but it was poorly cleaned with other people's hair still on sides of tub and bathroom floor. Shower enclosure in the bathroom was so tiny that it was almost unusable for my hubby and impossible for access to wash children. No view from our room except the roof of the pool enclosure. Sheets were put on king sized bed inside out and the pull out did not have sheets, we had to request them and then walk down to main desk and put them on bed ourselves. Wifi was unreliable with inconsistent connection and slow service. After seeing room, we decided that we did not want to trust cleanliness of complementary breakfast and so we went out to eat.",

When I tried to call hotels.com to get assistance they gave me a very hard time, made me wait on the phone for nearly an hour and even then didn't resolve my request. The hotel smelled like smoke and didn't even have an elevator. The hot tub smelled really funky and old like mildew. The towels didn't smell clean either. Overall, try somewhere else. This place was rough.",

There was a flat screen TV in this room and a larger flat screen in the separate, king bed room. Sliding doors separate the living areas (including the bathroom) from the sleeping area. This was one of the larger, nicer and better equipped hotel rooms we've stayed in. There was a good selection available for the free breakfast and the dining area was large, and clean with good lighting and plenty of coffee.",
