I didn't even use the bathroom because I didn't want to catch any diseases.This place looks nothing like what was advertised on any website.I will not be staying there again no matter how inexpensive the rooms are.Avoid this place as much as possible.",

    "reviewText": "Booked travel  pkg through Expedia, never again!. Would have left immediately, but everywhere else  booked for this event  and left us stuck !..Dirty filthy ,roaches all over the place. Now I don't expect much from a cheap hotel and it is CHEAP but it is by far the worst I have ever seen and im not a 5 star hotel ,complaining wimp. But I had to write my very first hotel review!!.All 5 of the rooms we went through/viewed  in 3 nights smelled  BAD, the floors were so dirty and gross I never took my shoes off. The bathrooms were full of mold and filth the tubs look like someone tried to paint them 10 yrs ago and you didn't want to be be barefoot in there believe me.One shower had the on/off valve at the shower  head? Nicotine stained ceilings/walls with holes in them. Terrrible beds with bed bugs!  springs popping out ,comforters with all sort of unknown stains.The last room had the stove removed,leaving the natural gas pipe/valve  exposed with no plug on the line allowing anyone to turn it on.That is a very serious Hazard. The kind that LEVELS buildings killing everyone.When I told the desk she said oh thought they plugged those up..Im pretty sure these are rented as apartments during off peak times cheaper.The kind of damage substained to these rooms doesn't come from travelers with their families, there was grease so thick on the range hood and sides of the stoves you could scrape it off.The doors had all been kicked in and broke the trim making the doors barely able to latch",

There were roaches crawling around the room. My shower was broken, I had to hold the metal bar in to keep the water running from the shower head. And the room had a nauseating odor.
