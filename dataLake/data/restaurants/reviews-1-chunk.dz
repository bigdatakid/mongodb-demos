The food in the small restaurant is delicious as was room service and both reasonably priced. My only complaint would be that we requested a quiet room, but our room was four doors down from the swimming pool entrance. It was very noisy and we were unable to sleep. I would look at this as more of a party hotel and less of a place to rest up for a busy day of sightseeing- just because of the constant hallway noise. Im not sure if there is a quieter place in the hotel since we requested such a room but got assigned to the pool area.",

Very lively pool area (loud but fun) and the rooms are delightful. Looks renovated, amazingly comfortable bed, I was on the 5th floor facing a quiet area, cute bathroom, clean and so convenient. Only thing I would have liked is a refrigerator as I'm used to the chains like Marriott and Hampton Inns etc., however, with a foodstore opposite and Starbucks plus other stores, it was no big deal. Will definitely stay there again. Will admit though that the direct rate booking through hotel website was cheaper than Expedia but it was too late, I had used Expedia for this booking.",

It was not even 20 minutes later that I was informed my room was ready. I booked a king guestroom with a city view and it was clean and spacious. The hotel was very prompt with my requests for more towels and an issue with the air conditioner, which was resolved in about only 10 minutes. Overall, my experience was excellent.

These ladies are definitely a dynamic duo and truly are a great representation of the Sportsmen's Lodge. Everyone there was very professional and were always readily available! At times, I felt like I would send so many emails asking questions, but Melissa and Cynthia responded to every one of them so promptly and did not mind. The venue was amazing--my husband and I had the Regency as our reception hall and we married at the North Garden. Even though it was chilly outside, the decorations in the North Garden were so romantic and help set the mood. The reception hall was set-up on time and everything was done to perfection. The staff during the reception were nothing but amazing and always willing to help!Thank you Sportsmen's Lodge and their team for making our wedding truly a dream come true!",

I felt as though I was in a really high end hotel. The staff was so friendly and helpful with everything. They had no problem taking their time in making sure I knew where to park, what accommodations they had, and how we could get to UNiversal Studios the easiest. Our room was an absolute delight. You could tell they really take care of each room. Our sheets were clean and the bathroom very modern and clean. The only reason I gave it a 4 and not a 5 in cleanliness is because in the shower there was a vent - that possible had a purpose prior to the updated renovations to the hotel - and before we took a shower a big spider crawled out from it. In the morning another spider was found in the shower. The hotel also gave my husband and I a smart tablet in the room at no extra cost to use for the stay that told about restaurants, grocery stores, attractions, and information about the hotel. It was so cool and a great help in finding where we could eat late in the night.",
