I checked out the first room...gap in the door frame so large that anyone could easily break in. i asked for another room...got a mini suite. Refrigerator was frosted up so no cold air in the fridge. AC was barely able to cool the room. Room was old and dated. After one night in the room and finding roaches in the kitchen and bedroom I had had enough. I took a shower and I noticed that my feet were leaving dirty footprints in the bathroom floor! I immediately called Expedia and got the room refunded and went somewhere else. AVOID THIS DEAL!",

I had to go to the store to buy bleach and towels just to be able to shower.  I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. EVER no matter how cheap it is.",
