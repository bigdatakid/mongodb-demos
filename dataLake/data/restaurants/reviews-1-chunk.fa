Our first night there we discovered that we had an infestation of vermin in the cottage. One actually ran across my face in the middle of the night. We were up all night fighting the vermin. We called customer service the next morning. When they arrived they told us this does not happen at their cabins. We found the nest of vermin. Were told to go into the city and they would get their gun and shoot them. I called the office and asked that we be moved. We were told that they did not have another cabin like the one we had paid for so they moved us next door. We were told that they quarantined our original cabin for several days. I called repeatedly and received no answer and no call back. After the 7th or 8th call I did get hold of a reprehensive who told me that they would refund one night (minus the 250+ cleaning fee). I asked to speak to the manger I was told that this would not happen and this was over. I don't think it is unreasonable to have an expectation when you pay 500.00 for two days to have a clean cabin. Can you imagine staying at a hotel...having a room full of vermin and being told that they would come in an shoot them...oh and have to pay a cleaning fee",

Many cabins are large enough for two or more families which make it fairly cheap especially when you take into account that you can cook some meals in the kitchen. Also perfect for romantic getaways or a honeymoon.We stayed at the brand new Firefly Lodge and were extremely impressed with the amenities (game room, home theater, private hot tub, amazingly comfortable beds).

    "reviewText": "We stayed at Elk Springs Resort for the week of Thanksgiving. This was our first time with this resort and will not be our last. The resort cabin was exactly as advertised (which is rare) and the resort staff and reservations people are great to work with. Everything is in 1st class condition. The place is in a great location with easy access to Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge. We had about 4 inches of snow and cold conditions which only made the fireplace and hot tub that much more enjoyable. The theater room is very nice. The resort roads were well maintained so we didn't have to worry about driving conditions. This will likely become a family Thanksgiving tradition.",

We were booked for 4 days and didn't want to leave, so we added another night once we arrived. The staff at Elk Springs is the most professional and courteous that we have ever worked with. Thank you for a Christmas Vacation that we will always remember and cherish. We will be back soon!!!!",

We had planned to be out and about most of the time by the cabin was so nice, we actually spent most of our time there. It was so nice to get away from our busy lives for a few days and just enjoy each others company. We will definitely be back!",

    "reviewText": "My husband and I stayed at Tree Tops which is in Bearfoot Resort, but managed by Elk Springs Resort. Up until our stay, I received emails to keep me posted on the status of our reservation. I also received a phone call to confirm before Elk Springs charged my credit card for the remainder of our fees. Everyone I spoke to was extremely courteous and professional. The day of our arrival, we received a phone call to let us know the cabin was clean and ready for our arrival, along with information about the door and security codes. After mentioning that our arrival would be well after dark, we arrived at the cabin to find the porch light and most of the interior lights were left on for us. The cabin was absolutely adorable. The two large flat screen televisions were awesome for watching Saturday's games. The kitchen had not only the basics, but good quality cookware and every small appliance we could possibly need to cook meals during our stay. The best part was the views from the two covered porches. Whether grilling out, rocking in the gliders or eating a meal on the upper level porch, the views of Mt. LeConte were breathtaking! On the lower level, we could enjoy the view from the hot tub or swing, which were my personal favorites! This cabin was a little more expensive than some we've stayed in previously, but it was by far the nicest. We agreed that we will definitely be contacting Elk Springs next time we visit the Smokies!",
