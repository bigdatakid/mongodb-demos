I gave him my $2 and he looked as me as if he is just done saving my life through a critical heart surgery and that I am such a jerk I only paid him 2 dollars. He walked away without even saying \"Thank you!\". Also a night before our departure, we came to an uncleaned room at 5 pm (we left before 9 am for sight seeing and came back super tired), and when I called the front desk, he asked me \"do you want it to be cleaned?!\", Me: \"...of course\", and the response was \"no problem, I send someone to clean the room!\", not even an \"I am sorry!\". We have to hang outside in the hall way while it was being cleaned superfast in 5 minutes.",

I would never have guessed, but there is a pool on the third floor.  The restaurant downstairs (Jackson 20) is very hip and swanky to go for a drink, and dinner there is very good as well.  I can't wait to go there when it warms up to take advantage of the courtyard and balconies.",

A try of food from that 2 hour wait sat in the hall for 28 hours- along with other trays. Twice- service personal quietly locked on the door and then walked in before I could even ask who was there. On the third day, the room was cleaned but they did not actually close the door so my room and valuables were left exposed and vulnerable to theft- which is concerning when you realize that you can walk off the street into the underground garage and go into the elevator with no key and no one seeing you and straight to the hotel room floors. There are other small things but these were the big issues. I stay in hotels a lot- this is the first time I felt it really important to write a negative review.",

We had a unfortunate luck of being placed next door to a rude family with unruly children. The parents decided to take advantage of the wine reception, while leaving their two young children under the age of 10 alone to scream, bang on walls, slam doors and run up and down the hallways for hours. At one point one of the children rode the elevator down with my husband (a complete stranger) to find their mother. I will say the hotel staff did a great job locating their parents and handling the situation. Later in the evening, my husband was confronted by an intoxicated women wanting to join him in our hotel room. Needless to say, the wine reception was a spoil to our weekend. Great hotel and staff otherwise. Don't know that we will be returning again though!",

We enjoyed shopping and dining on King Street, and we also took the King Street Trolley to the Metro Station for sightseeing in DC!

It was not prepared for my arrival and there was some kind of leak so an entire section of carpet was soaking wet. I would not recommend this hotel to anybody.

    "reviewText": "My husband and I, along with another couple, really enjoyed our stay at the Alexandria Monaco. We were there for a full weekend to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. The hotel staff made it very welcoming for us by providing champagne and chocolate dipped strawberries. We upgraded our room to one with a terrace, which was nice because it was a large room, and we got to see another wedding in the courtyard. The front door of the hotel is right on King Street, which was always busy with people walking around. The hotel is within walking distance of so many things. There are several cafes and small restaurants nearby. Parking is reasonable compared to other parking garages in and around the DC area. We would definitely go back to this Kimpton property.",

I wish we had had more time to take advantage of all the hotel had to offer. It was an incredibly comfortable hotel room and the service was always friendly. My roommate needed a lint roller and she called guest services and while they didn't have a lint roller, they tried their best to solve her problem and brought her a roll of scotch tape. We had some drinks and appetizers at the hotel restaurant (jackson 20? jackson #), and the drinks were fun and delicious, as was the cheese and meat plate (I can't spell the fancy word for meat plate--charcuterie?). While it didn't wake me up or keep me up, once I was awake, I did notice that the sound from the hallway was very easy to hear through the door as we were right across from the elevator, but it was not an inconvenience to me, and the rest of our stay was very quiet and private.",

And the hotel is very conveniently located. But if we'd known that this place was going to be overrun with dogs, we'd have booked in somewhere else, like the sister property Lorien (where we've enjoyed staying before). You really should highlight to potential guests that dogs and cats are allowed at this property, so those of us who have allergies or just don't enjoy having animals up close and personal can have advance notice of the situation here. At least give patrons the option of booking a pet-free room!",
