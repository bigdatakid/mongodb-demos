The Fiesta was clean with nice size rooms and great bedding. The hotel restaurant serves a nice buffet breakfast. The location is right beside the popular Hyatt Hotel but much more affordable.

    "reviewText": "Fiesta Inn Centro Historico is right next door to the hotel I usually stay at, and it's less than half the price. Overall, it's a good hotel at a good price. However, there are some logistics problems - the entrance to the hotel is in the back of a small shopping mall area, so you have to go through the mall and take an elevator up to the hotel lobby. There is no real drop off location for taxis, and if someone is picking you up you need to make sure you clarify which of the three mall entrances they will come to ... or walk across the street and meet at the hotel next door. That said, the room was clean and spacious, the hotel restaurant was quite pleasant, and the staff was very friendly and helpful.",

Wow - large dining table, modern living room furnishings, sliding split door into bedroom is what I expect from larger and more expensive hotels. All the modern amenities you would expect of a 5-star hotel are at this hotel. The 4th floor offers courtesy water and coffee every morning. Room service is also excellent, and prices are quite reasonable in light of the current money exchange rates between pesos and dollars. Housekeeping is quick with delivery for more towels, and hair dryer as requested in our last trip to this hotel. Hotel is located 2 floors above the Parque Alameda Shopping mall with several quick service restaurants you would expect in the U.S., a bank, bookstore, coffee shop, sporting goods store. You could stay in the hotel and visit the shops and spend your weekend there and not be bored, but you would then miss the sights and sounds of Mexico City. Definitely will return soon.",
