Also the showers in 1 room did't work, I was quickly changed from rooms, but that room the water never regulated. It went from hot to cold to freezing, to scolding hot. Overall it was what I paid for. I would not stay there again.",

So thick you couldn't breathe. The kitchen was filthy. The walls were yellow and sticky from smoke. I was afraid to sit down in the place. I walked in and left 5 minutes later. We did not stay there! I will be requesting a refund as we had to find another hotel. It was the worst experience I have ever had. Ever!",

    "reviewText": "the hotel owners do not care about the hotel or the people staying there. the building needs a lot of work. the room is dingy, dirty and all the items inside are old and/broken. the room they gave us had a decent lock design, but the frame and door did not match so there was a large gap around the door. the AC unit was coming out of the wall, the appliances are old and dirty(no light in the fridge, frost in about 1/5 of the freezer, blow dryer didn't work due to a bad plug), bulb missing from the lamp in the living area and the ice machine in the hall doesn't work. the cleaning and maintenance crew consisted of older people who did enough to get by. we never received fresh towels or someone to come clean out the room. when the lights went out in the bathroom, it took 3 hours to get someone to come by. instead of bring a bulb, he came, took the burnt bulb and then came back again 10minutes later. Internet was pretty much nonexistence in the room. they kept saying that they have to reboot the router, but after a day of trying, they blamed it on time warner. the internet in the lobby area was great though, but that's not where i want to spend my time working. the pictures on Expedia are probably a few years old. we only used the room as a drop off point for our stuff as we were out most of the time, so if you don't plan on \"staying\" in the hotel, it's ok. still would have liked fresh towels. if i knew i could upload pictures on my review, i would have taken some.",
