I had two beds in my bedroom, so one night I slept in one bed, and in the second night I slept on the second bed. During the second night, I woke up with a few bites in my leg, and it was itching a lot. I ignored, but moments later there were more bites. I changed beds because I needed to get more sleep for my exam, and could not go through something in the middle of the night to change rooms. I told the staff, and all I got was I'm sorry. That was it. The manager did not contacted me, nor was there a concern about my bites and how I was doing. I threw away my clothes that were in that bedroom, and I'm never coming back there. I spent over 100 dollars each night, for one night wake up itching everywhere. The reason why I didn't book a cheap hotel, at the end, didn't make much difference for me.",
