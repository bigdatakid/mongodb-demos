This place is a magical jungle oasis! You actually feel like you are in the jungle with sounds of frogs lulling you to sleep every night. We woke up every morning to the sunrise off the top balcony. The house had all the amenities we needed. We cooked at home for almost every meal and enjoyed the views of the jungle from the screen lanai. We also hiked down to the private swimming hole and waterfall below the house and it was so serene! Be sure to take the path along the right side with the railing; it was SO worth the 5-minute trek! This house is also in the perfect location where you feel remote but you are able to walk into town, which we did every day to go to the farmers market and the kombucha bar. We highly recommend and will definitely be coming back!"},{"_id":"367880085","date":{"$date":"2019-01-05T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"30792780","reviewer_id":"121521420","reviewer_name":"Ben","comments":"Beautiful, brand new, and nicely furnished house with stunning views from the upstairs and downstairs balconies. My girlfriend and I spent 4 nights in Hilo and this place was exactly what we were looking for. We enjoyed meals and coffee on the back screened-in porch and loved the spacious tiled showers, the jacuzzi bath tub in the upstairs master, and the incredible wood finish throughout the whole house. There is also a waterfall located on the property, just a short walk down the hill. Only a 10 minute walk to downtown Hilo, and a 5-10 minute drive to Honoli’i beach which is a great beginner - intermediate surf spot. If you are looking to get away with your significant other or a small group of friends, I would highly recommend this jungle getaway."},{"_id":"404118268","date":{"$date":"2019-01-22T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"30792780","reviewer_id":"18970052","reviewer_name":"Sara","comments":"Stylish, clean house in a quiet neighborhood.

We found the home clean and in good order when we arrived. As it turns out, our favorite perk of this home was the master bed mattress! What a lovely treat to have a great nights sleep each night! The home stayed cool with the fans and windows and we never wanted for any air conditioning. The proximity to Hilo also made this home a great choice for us.

We also enjoyed coffee on the screened-in porch several times.\n\nWe did have a couple of questions throughout our stay, and Sierra was quick to respond via text and email.

On Sat, the farmers market less than a mile away is full of incredible fruits and veg with other souvenirs and things.  Location wise in general is perfect to explore this side of the island.  A bit north is the Tropical Botanical Gardens, a bit south to Volcano National Park and some other impressive coastlines and black sand beaches.

Was told to go to someone's apartment (not the host) to pick up the keys. When we arrived at the Airbnb's location, we had a very difficult time finding parking despite the host telling us that there is plenty of free parking available. The building itself was under heavy construction (wires hanging down from the ceiling in the lobby, clutter in the hallways, etc...). The unit's floors were dirty including in the bathroom, the bedsheets were stained, we found hair in bedding, the heat was very high with no way to control the temperature, and one of the kitchen cabinet doors came off entirely when opened. The mattresses can barely even be called mattresses as they were extremely uncomfortable with minimal support. The pillows were as flat as flat can be (either very poor quality or extremely old). Needless to say, we did NOT enjoy our stay despite the host's \"Superhost\" status. Would not stay with this host again."}]}

Your stylish home is sure to be the wanted reservation for many other young adults in the future. Some things to note could be the somewhat unstable toilet and shower door the does not close fully. Please also note that despite the wonderfully new TV, there was no audio output. Overall, a great stay and would be happy to return. Location is also very convenient and close to bank, grocery store and parking lot. Great small home for groups of 4, clean and modern and reasonably priced."}]}

However, also as seen in the pictures, there’s no laptop friendly work space – even if it’s listed in the Amenities section.\n\nWe arrived to a cold flat after having some trouble finding it (the building doesn’t have a street number), and heating it up took all evening – partially because there’s a big gap under the flat’s entrance door, and the stairwell is open to the outside at all times. Which leads us to the next issue – stray cat feces and stains on the steps. It was cleaned now and then, but not nearly often enough.\n\nThe building is old and full of ‘old house noises’, from neighbors and the environment. While some of this can be charming, I would have expected other things to be in order, easy things like tightening a door bolt so that it doesn’t rattle whenever someone downstairs breathes.\n\nAll in all we’re happy enough considering how cheap the place is and its great location, but there are things we want people to know about before deciding whether to rent."},{"_id":"404449286","date":{"$date":"2019-01-24T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"30921897","reviewer_id":"60709063","reviewer_name":"Артемий","comments":"This is a very beautiful and cozy apartment in the heart of Istanbul.

It was a very clean \u0026 well-kept place, in an excellent location in the old city. There were many restaurants \u0026 stores within walking distance, and it was a quick 10-minute walk to the Blue Mosque (Sultanahmet) area. \r\n\r\nMs. Ece, who lives just downstairs, is the Manager of this place, has good English and was very friendly \u0026 welcoming. We were served cool juice and cookies upon our arrival and were given a good map of the area. Ms. Ece also did a great job in arranging our late night departure for the airport by a private car.\r\n\r\nThe \"apartment\" was small, but adequate, with not much room for your luggage, if you are two people like we were. It has a small kitchen area and bathroom, and the roof terrace was a nice touch. This is really not a full apartment, as there was also an open living area and another \"apartment\" (or room?) on the same floor. But it was private and comfortable.

Show the driver your address and ask him how much it will cost.  It cost us 50 lira to get there.  When we left we took a taxi to the bus station and it cost us 35 lira.  Taking the tram for the first time might be a bit too much.  \n\nThe room was clean and big enough for two people.  It had a fridge and a hot plate if you choose to cook anything.  It had air conditioning which was quite nice to be able to close the window at night to block out the noises.  The building was nice as well.  We did not go on the terrace, but I'm sure it was lovely.  \n\nThe area is touristy enough that you still feel safe at night and not too secluded.  Plenty of restaurant options and little markets to buy snacks are around.  My friend and I got lost often, so I highly recommend taking photos of street names and make sure you know where you are.  The streets are confusing and sometimes there aren't street names.  \n\nSultan was very sweet, as well as her husband, but we mostly dealt with Ece her daughter who spoke English pretty well.  She was very sweet and very helpful with setting up a bus ticket for us, calling the taxi, etc.  A very smart young lady who has a bright future.  \n\nI highly recommend staying here and hope maybe someday I can go back.

The room was fantastic, the top floor of their building, lots of light, patio overlooking a schoolyard. The apartment is literally a 5 minute walk to the center of the Sultanahmet. You might need a GPS to find it initially, but after that, it's all good. It's close to numerous little eateries and stores, as well as Little Aya Sofia. The people in the neighborhood were very friendly. I got lost looking for the street and a local man kindly used his iPhone to get me there. The wifi worked great, the bathroom was very clean and the hot water came up immediately. The bed was comfy.

Right from the first moment, Sultan's daughter Ece took great care of us, bringing us a map and a guide to Istanbul. She went over our itinerary with us and would chat with us almost daily asking us about our day and giving us advice. She was even available on (Hidden by Airbnb) if we had doubts about prices at Grand Bazaar and such!\r\nThe room is beautiful! It is very stylishly decorated and very cozy. The room had counterspace, provision to make tea or coffee and even an electric stove. Like most other hotel rooms in the area, it has less square footage but it is not a problem if you are spending the day sightseeing anyways. The room has a balcony as well and at no point we felt that we were cramped. The bathroom was cleaned daily and served its purpose. Just outside the room is a lobby and you can see the picture of that with a spiral staircase. They keep the fridge filled with bottled water that you can take anytime. Ece gave us a tour of the building as well later to show us their backyard and cute fruit trees. It was overall a very clean, cozy space and we thoroughly enjoyed staying at Bright Apartments.\r\nThe biggest selling point of this place is the location! It is a 10 min walk to Sultanahmet square and the places of historical importance. The tram station is also right there near the Blue mosque and made traveling very easy. Ece had explained to us about the tram system and all the trains available to places of importance. There are also restaurants, and Arasta Bazaar and some decent bars close by if you want to dine somewhere close by to the hotel after a long day of sightseeing. There are shared shuttles also available very close by to and from airports if you dont want a private transfer.

I am a girl travelling alone and I could say this place is pretty safe. The room is super clean, and very well equipped. There are close supermarkets and restaurants so you can find anything you need. The room is a bit smaller than it seems in the picture, so if you are two people it might be a little snug, but if you are alone it is perfectly fine. The hosts are super friendly, communicative, and available. I definitely recommend this place and would stay there again if I visit in the future.

It's a beautiful,  safe, and private locale with top amenities. \n- Beautiful: overlooking a semi-private lagoon onto the gorgeous Pacific Ocean, where we sipped wine for every sunset\n- Safe: the facilities are only accessible with an encoded plastic \"key\". This gets you inside the buildings, use of the elevator, into your room, onto the grounds. You even have to use it to get OUT of the private grounds and onto the lagoon (a feature, not a bug).\n- Private: it's away from the hustle N bustle of Honolulu, but that's just a 45 min drive away on the H1. The grounds are manicured daily,  lots of trees and Hawaiian flora. The Koi ponds are a big hit with the keiki (children). \n- Amenities: Our lanai had 4 beach chairs, 2 bogey boards, a mid-sized ice cooler, and children's beach toys. You can open up the 'wall' to the lanai and make it feel like its part of the room. The kitchen was fully loaded with what we needed to cook, including a cork screw. I liked that the master suite had its own thermostat for the air conditioner. Nice master bathroom too. The WIFI worked. If I had questions regarding the unit, I got answers within hours, not days. There are restaurants and stores about a 7 min walk away, including Roy's, an upper-scale place to get good island cuisine."}]}

It is so incredibly central making for a quick walk to all the best Cafes and restaurants in Surry Hills. The location was perfect for me as I was in Sydney on business so was able to schedule a lot of my business meetings over coffee - David's location subsequently made my time very efficient. Upon arrival David provided clear instructions on the house amenities. He graciously provided a bottle of red wine (which I didn't drink but the thought was very much appreciated). We didn't see a lot of each other due to our busy work schedules. I unfortunately left my wallet at David's when I was in  rush to leave so he offered to post this to me in Victoria. \nHis house is spotlessly clean and I loved having cable tv available in the room when I just wanted to chill out for a while. The house is located behind busy Taylor square but it get like it was locked away in a private suburb - there was no evidence of any street noise at all. A little oasis in a very busy intersection of Oxford and Flinders st. I look forward to having the chance to stay with David again in future.

I wasn't. \r\nOne negative, and it was a big shock with me being from London, was that I came home one day and there were tons of tiny spiders on the wall of my room, that must have come in from the patio. I managed to spray as many as I could, but I must have missed a few as the following few days I kept seeing bigger and bigger spiders in the room. I told DJ about it and he cleaned the dead spiders and spray off the walls, but really what should have happened is that the room should have been fumigated the next day, or I should have recieved some kind of compensation.\r\nI guess spiders are not seen as a big deal in Australia. \r\nSo overall good, except for the spiders."},{"_id":"62290716","date":{"$date":"2016-02-13T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"310414","reviewer_id":"729630","reviewer_name":"Dwight","comments":"Wonderful stay!

She has prepared the room so nicely and I felt welcome from the minute I set foot into the apartment. The view from the balcony is a dream. I could have spent my entire time - and longer - only sitting on the comfortable spot and looking at the view day and night. It is a dream.\nThe location couldn't be better. It is close to all amenities and not in the part of Waikiki that is too crowded and packed with tourists. There are excellent eateries around that provide good food for agreeable prices and the Hilton Hawaiian Village is only a few hundert meters away where there is a firework every Friday night; plus the lagoon is also closeby which is not as crowded as the main beach. Still you can walk to Waikiki beach and the shopping street as it is all close (or take the Waikiki trolley; it's only 2$ one way).\nIn the house itself there is also a pool, sauna and gym. I have to admit that I have only used the pool and that was very relaxing as there was noone around.\nTo sum it up, I would always go back to Lei and Maree's and recommended to all guests. Thank you for making my Hawaiian experience so enjoyable!"},{"_id":"407627832","date":{"$date":"2019-02-02T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"31080472","reviewer_id":"214073265","reviewer_name":"Devesh","comments":"The place is awesome, at a very good location and has everything you need to stay there.\nI was really touched by the hospitality shown.

We stayed when there were 8 people, but it was still quiet and peaceful for so many people. There are three toilets and showers, and many lockers. Chile was very friendly, responsive, and helpful. The location is convenient, with the nearest bus stop (the 720 line to Central) a minute outside the door, and five minutes from the MTR station.
