The coziness, the taste in furnishing the place, in choosing the interior design, the cleanliness, the fragrance chosen for every corner of the flat makes the experience unique.

I can tell you from our experience of living in this city, as well as staying in a number of airbnb's in HK, that this place is very unique in how spacious it is. The layout is one large square, with 1/2 of the space being for the comfy living room and the other half split between the bed and the dining area. There's also a small (by western standards) but completely sufficient (by Hong Kong standards) bathroom with hair dryer and toiletries. The hosts did a nice job of dividing the place with curtains that can be drawn back for light or pulled shut to partition off the different section for a more cozy feel. We enjoyed our short stay here and walked everywhere for meals, as this area of HK has a lot of cafes, eateries, and is very close to the MTR.

First off, the place is huge for Hong Kong standards, especially in such a central location, right next to Sheung Wan MTR! I saw the photos and previous reviews, but was still amazed. I've stayed in many hotels in HK and visited friends in their homes, and this must have been the largest private, non-commercial space I've been in! Lots of lovely touches by the hosts with tips and tricks on how to operate the shower heater, the remote controls, all the little things that make you feel more comfortable and at-home in a new space. I had a couple of friends over for dinner one of the nights I was there, and the kitchen had all the amenities needed to cook up a simple meal, and I bought groceries from a Wellcome supermarket that was walking distance from the place. The bed was comfortable. If you're finnicky about privacy or sunlight, the studio space is designed such that you'll need to draw a more-than-usual number of curtains when you go to bed. Lots of little local eateries and nice restaurants/ cafe around the neighbourhood as well - Sheung Wan is very hip. A great stay overall, reminded me why I love Airbnb. Highly recommended.

The location is excellent with easy access to the MTR. It's also within easy walking distance to so many cool/fun areas and we really felt like we were living in the city as it's on a quaint little side street.\n\nThe apartment itself is very large and was perfect for two people but could easily accommodate a third.  It was super clean and I really loved the interior design, the plants and all of the interesting knick knacks adorning the apartment. Also, the apartment is thoughtfully marked all over with notes so that you can find/use anything that you needed.\n\nLastly, the hosts were really responsive and nice and I wouldn't hesitate to book this place again if we are ever lucky to be back in Hong Kong! =)"},{"_id":"336146442","date":{"$date":"2018-10-14T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"21441057","reviewer_id":"2601835","reviewer_name":"Kristy","comments":"Selina’s place was beyond my expectation!

She had an alarm system so I felt safe and it was easy to check-in. Location was great, in the middle of the Plateau. The only issue, which was quite disappointing is that her place did not provide wifi although it said on the website said that it was part of the amenities. It was also annoying that she did not warn me of this and that it took her quite a while to tell me and I had to text and ask her multiple times about it before she told me that it had been cut off. This was frustrating for me since I was there apartment hunting and thus was dependent on wifi for this. She also stated she would reimburse me for this but still has not yet and it has been a few weeks now. I understand she was travelling at the time but I would have at least appreciated better communication about this. If there were not issues with the wifi or communication, I wouldn't have any more complaints about her place."},{"_id":"270594608","date":{"$date":"2018-05-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"21511027","reviewer_id":"27127866","reviewer_name":"Therese","comments":"Ivonne’s place is in a centralized area in a small gated sub community in the city.

There are also endless amount of place to eat, grab dessert, or grab a drink in the area.  The place is modern and clean. The bed is extra firm and pillows are really soft, so that’s something to keep in mind. There are two small windows in the room, but because of their high location they can’t be opened for light/air. \nI did not get a chance to meet \n\nIvonne because she was on vacation during my stay. However, she is fairly responsive via text. \nAlso, be sure to clarify amenities with Ivonne prior to your check-in, there was no wi-fi or cable tv as listed in her apartment amenities. She also didn’t have the apartment cleaned till the second day I was there. She did state it was due to a call out on the cleaners behalf, but she failed to leave me instructions for where I could find bedding/towels in the meantime. Luckily, I just  opened the room door closest, and I saw extra sheets and towels.  \nAfter all said and done, Ivonne did offer me a small amount off for the lack of initial cleanliness and lack of WiFi and tv in the apartment, but her attitude was a bit nonchalant in general, which pissed me off initially."},{"_id":"279045785","date":{"$date":"2018-06-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"21511027","reviewer_id":"140924410","reviewer_name":"Joel","comments":"Endroit paisible \nTrès près des commodités \nBeau condo"},{"_id":"292272462","date":{"$date":"2018-07-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"21511027","reviewer_id":"1376548","reviewer_name":"Redouane","comments":"Ivonne's place is the place that you are looking for, very modern, air conditioning is huge bonus, specially when we know how humid and hot in  Montreal in July.

Il n'y a eu aucun problème de communication par mail ou en direct avec Rhonda, qui est disponible à tout moment mais pas intrusive. Elle est chaleureuse et nous a accueilli, ma femme, mon fils et moi, dans la joie et la bonne humeur. Son appartement, situé au rez de chaussée d'une maison, est très agréable et a le confort nécessaire que l'on attendait. Le quartier est calme et typique de ce que l'on s'imaginait au travers de nos seuls repères que nous avions, à savoir des images télévisuelles. Rhonda s'est rendue disponible pour notre départ (réveil à 02:45) et à notre demande s'est occupée de nous réserver la veille une voiture pour nous déposer à JFK (30$, contre 60$ à notre arrivée dans un Yellow cab). Le léger éloignement de cet appartement n'a pas été un inconvénient, cela nous a permis de découvrir Brooklyn, cela en vaut la peine de jour comme de nuit, de prendre le métro comme tous ceux dont c'est le quotidien, et de nous échapper de la vie trépidante et du bruit de Manhattan.\r\nJe ne regrette absolument pas mon choix et je conseillerai à ceux qui veulent découvrir NY de ne pas se cantonner à Manhattan et de s'ouvrir aux districts moins \"cosy\" de réputation comme l'est Harlem ou encore le Bronx, et pour Brooklyn je conseillerai l'appartement de Rhonda."},{"_id":"13319694","date":{"$date":"2014-05-25T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2151479","reviewer_id":"12655448","reviewer_name":"Anna","comments":"Rhonda was a most helpful and welcoming host. She was easy to get hold of and promptly answered any questions.\r\nThe apartment was freshly painted, clean and tidy. There was plenty of space for our four suitcases, a wardrobe to hang clothes, tables and areas to charge our mod-cons, spread ourselves out and so on. The double bed has a firm mattress and soft, clean sheets. The windows look out onto the car porch and street but we were undisturbed. The bathroom was newly refurbished with shiny surfaces and a fantastic hot shower which we really appreciated. The dining area was where we caught up on work and watched TV. The kitchen looks out onto an old garden with tall trees. We helped ourselves to juice, muffins, toast and coffee in the mornings out of Rhonda's fridge. In the evenings, the apartment was very pleasant for chilling out without having to go out. There is a double pull-out sofa and a three-seater leather sofa as well. Our children enjoyed visiting us and there was plenty of room. It is cosy, gently-used apartment, with interesting things to look at and think about, including a collection of old and beautiful lamps.\r\nThe street is quiet. There are two laundromats on the same street, sundry stores, a Chinese takeaway and a beautiful Roman Catholic church nearby. We attended mass on a Sunday and admired how beautifully Brooklyners dress for church. We said hello to the priest and attended the crowning of the statue of the Virgin Mary in the garden. We felt like part of the community - the kind that says \"Bless You\" from across the isle when someone sneezes in the pew behind you. I was very happy to attend a mass where people shouted Amen! Gospel style.\r\nThe subway is a short and very pleasant walk away. We walked to and from the station along different streets just to see how everyone lived. There are a number of old, gorgeous buildings in this area. The subway for the A and C takes you to all the hip and happening places in Brooklyn, as well as to Manhattan City. We discovered several great restaurants, like the Black Swan, The Islands, Saraghina, Stonehome, Prospect, and many more in the Lafayette and Franklin areas. \r\nWe were in NY to attend our daughter's graduation from NYU which is held at Yankee Stadium so this Brooklyn apartment was ideal for the airport, the stadium, Manhattan, and our children's apartment two streets away.\r\nRhonda lives in the same building and checked in on us every day. We always had something to ask her. We felt very at home, as if we were staying with friends, and certainly by the second day we had become friends and spent a couple of evenings chatting. It was wonderful to get to know Rhonda and get a feel for the community instead of flitting in and out of places and feeling like you never actually arrived. We will be back."},{"_id":"19331408","date":{"$date":"2014-09-10T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2151479","reviewer_id":"20020018","reviewer_name":"Pietro","comments":"My wife and I have been staying at Rhonda's place for two weeks, and everthing perfectly matched airbnb's descriptions.

I wouldn't consider this as 'private apartment' since Rhonda and her daughters lives right above the place and come in and out our place any time they want without prior notice. \nAfter we started to lock our door the situation improved but they proceed visiting the place while we were out.\n2. There are washing and drying machines standing in the middle of the living room. But you are not allowed to use  it (unless you are ready to pay $50 penalty to Rhonda). Well, it is not a problem, but the problem is that Rhonda is using it for her own needs while you live there.\n3. You should be prepared to hear Rhonda's comments about the way you do things starting from microwave usage to cloths packing basing on what she saw in your apartment while you were out\n\n\nI understand that some of these things might be ok if you renting a room, but we rented the apartment and hoped to have some privacy.\n\n\nOn the positive side - it is quiet there at night and the air is fresh. \n"},{"_id":"20251869","date":{"$date":"2014-09-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2151479","reviewer_id":"7191632","reviewer_name":"Barbara","comments":"Our stay at Rhonda's apartment was perfect in all ways.

For most of the week, I stayed there with one guest. Then, my BF joined us for the rest of the booking. It was a little tight with three adults, but we made it work. \r\nIf you're going to be sightseeing in Manhattan, Rhonda's apartment is an ideal home base. That said, during rush hour, it can take \u003e60 mins to get back from Midtown. Also, the apartment is a \u003e10 mins walk to either subway line. \r\nStaying at this place allowed us to explore Brooklyn as well as Manhattan.

It is close to Metro stations (A and C to Manhattan); The metro is at 17minutes of walk. The neighborhood is nice, with some restaurants and conveninent stores next to the appartment.\ni recommand to take ear plugs because it can be a little noisy outside in the street, as the bed is next to the window on the street side.\nRhonda was very helpfull with her advises. She even allowed us to leave our luggages at her appartment after checkout time, because our plane was late. \nThanks.

The home is on a very cute and quiet residential street, with nice restaurants nearby.\n\nThe main thing I would note is that it's the first floor of Rhonda's home so while there are two doors to close to make it private, it's not necessarily \"the entire place to yourself\" so that is something to keep in mind; it's not as private as we had initially expected. \n\nAlso, if you're going to spend time in Manhattan, it is quite a trek either by cab or subway so keep that in mind.

Rhonda hat alles sehr gründlich geputzt und es war sehr sauber. Wenn man auf der Suche nach einer grosszügigen Wohnung mit einem gemütlichen Aufenthaltsbereich ist, dann ist die Wohnung nicht ideal. Für einen Städtetrip ist man ja aber sowieso mehr oder unterwegs und hierfür ist es ein guter Rückzugsort. Zur nächsten Ubahn ist es ca 12 Minuten - das sollte man im Hinterkopf haben, aber es ist eben NY - aber es gibt diverse Citi Bike Stations in der Nähe. Wer viel und ruhigen Schlaf braucht sollte im Hinterkopf haben, dass die Wohnung im EG liegt und die Gastgeber inkl Kleinkind ebenfalls im Haus wohnen...etwas hellhörig aber hat für uns ansonsten gepasst."},{"_id":"296319708","date":{"$date":"2018-07-25T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2151479","reviewer_id":"97366065","reviewer_name":"Nicolò","comments":"Rhonda is a very good and always available host!!!

Me and my family of 6 (5 adults and 2 children) fit comfortably into Natalie's place. The home is as beautiful as described and photographed. Very well and tastefully decorated in Hawaiian theme. The rooms are big esp the rooms with the king beds. The property is gorgeous. Its a little oasis in the middle of a suburban street. Really loved all the nature surrounding the home, the lovely front patio and driveway with the buddha statues and flowers. \nThe showers were fully equipped with towels, shampoo and conditioner. There were plenty of extra towels and sheets. The rooms were impeccably clean. Great wi-fi which was very fast. Ditto loved the TV which we could watch Netflix on. The kitchen was big enough to have breakfast or dinner together. There were all the appliances necessary in the kitchen including a coffee maker, rice cooker, toaster, etc. Also loved having a washer and dryer in the home to do our laundry. \nNatalie was an excellent host who checked us in and gave us a wonderful welcome of treats such as champagne, banana bread and excellent fruit. She even showed me where to get excellent poke down the street at Tamura's (highly recommend this place to others who visit!) These little touches were unique and greatly appreciated. \nThe location is about 10-15 min from Waikiki via car but also 5-10 min away from key places for a family such as Foodland, Whole Foods, Long Drugs, Leonard's Bakery, etc. Great location for families like us who wanted to eat out and also cook. Parking was provided and we did not have any problem fitting 2 cars on the property. I would highly recommend this home while visiting Honolulu. Its a great price and value for families and groups!

I was in Honolulu for work and I had a mixed gender crew of 3 with me. Since we are all independent adults we need privacy as well as a nice public area to socialize in. Although the place is not huge, it has 4 very nice private bedrooms, an a lovey open plan living, dining and kitchen area. While many Airbnb’s are getting kind of sterile and impersonal, Natalie’s place was the opposite. It felt warm and comfortable, with a lot of very nice hand carved furniture and personal touches. Natalie was a perfect host. Welcoming and very responsive to any issues or suggestions we had.

Greg and Keana also accommodated an earlier check in and Keana was kind enough to provide lots of nice children's toys, high chair, changing table, etc. We should have left our travel crib at home given how nice everything was.

But you should consider the significant hill, if you are comming with a trolley or a wheelchair. However, the place was comfortable for staying with our 6 months old baby, and we enjoyed it a lot.

Cafes  It is hard to have a bad cafe experience in Erskineville/Alexandria (let us know if you do). The possibilities are nearly endless and we have only explored a fraction ourselves. These are our regulars: Ella Guru, 104A Swanson St, Erskineville NSW 2043 Closest cafe - very friendly and good value. Toasted sandwiches a great quick lunch. Meet Gerard,  54 Henderson Rd, Alexandria NSW 2015 Further to walk but our favourite by far. Excellent coffee and delicious breakfasts, cakes and sandwiches. If you need to get a train from Redfern Station (e.g. to go to Bondi Junction) then this is a good place to fuel up on caffeine on your walk to the station. Restaurants Again you’ll struggle to find a bad meal. There are a small number of restaurants along Erskineville Road which are all pretty good and if you venture to King Street...well you can have just about anything.  Here are the local places that draw us back agai","notes":"Here are few things to be aware of: In most parts of Sydney - especially in summer - it is almost impossible to live completely free of bugs like mosquitoes and cockroaches. We have the house professionally cleaned before your stay and use repellents. However, since the weather suits having the windows and doors open, it is very difficult to completely rid a house of them. We have left some repellent, spray and mosquito coils but otherwise, we hope they don’t disrupt your stay. Sydney can get very hot in the summer months. By keeping blinds down during the day (including the lightwell in the kitchen), and running the fan and leaving windows open at night, it usually stays a very pleasant temperature. There is aircon in the upstairs bedroom if you need it. Unfortunately some years we get a string of super hot days. We do hope the temperature is pleasant for you. This is our home most of the year, so some things might be a little different to professionally run accommodation. We hope tha","transit":"Getting there:  5 Ada Street is a short taxi or Uber ride from the airport. We are also a 5 minute walk from Erskineville Station. However, the airport train is about $18 one way (depending on times), so for two people it is often a similar price to take an Uber/taxi, unless you are in the middle of peak hour (around 7:30-9am or 4:30-6:30pm) when traffic is very heavy. Public transport:  There a several train stations at a short walking distance: Erskineville (5 mins), MacDonald Town (10 mins), Newtown (10 mins) and Redfern (20 mins). From Erskineville Station you can take a train directly to Circular Quay and the harbour. You can also take the train to Central (two stops), which has connections to the airport. We encourage you to get an Opal card from a newsagent of seven eleven (there is one just past the station on Erskineville road).

Having always stayed in Manhattan when travelling to New York, we didn't know what to expect from Brooklyn, but Williamsburg is fantastic and we will be going back to stay in the area again. The apartment is in a perfect location, in easy reach of Bedford Avenue where all the main amenities are. Russell was also kind enough to give us a list of bars and restaurants to try around the area, which proved to be very helpful. \r\n\r\nRussell was a brilliant host and was very flexible to our needs given we had to leave quite late on the return journey home. \r\n\r\nWould definitely go back and also recommend to friends and family!\r\n"},{"_id":"26641898","date":{"$date":"2015-02-16T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2153435","reviewer_id":"1962094","reviewer_name":"Nicolas","comments":"Great location, love the neighborhood !\r\nRussell was a great host.

It is 0 minutes to the metros stop, which is only one stop away from Manhattan. The instructions to get into the place were simple and easy. However, when we arrived, the apartment had not yet been cleaned. I tried calling Russell but had no immediate response. Sent an email and he responded quite quickly, and in the afternoon someone very nice came by to clean the place. A couple more things, the terrace is awesome, but shared with the adjoining apartment.

We were quite comfortable staying there. The place looks exactly like the photo, and the bed was wonderfully comfortable too, which helped us get enough rest to keep playing while we visited Brooklyn.  \r\n\r\nDuring out short, two night visit, we explored the neighborhood shopping, and dining. We were delighted to find a cosy place to dine called Juliette which had some fantastic wine and tasty tapas. Our second night, after enjoying dinner at Brasserie Witlof we saw the Book of Mormon musical in Manhattan, and ended our Saturday night by checking out Radegast Hall \u0026 Biergarten. Sunday morning we investigated Mimosa for brunch, and had some delicious bites to go with our cappuccinos. All in all, a wonderful visit.\r\n\r\nThank you Russell!"},{"_id":"54477482","date":{"$date":"2015-11-20T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2153435","reviewer_id":"30953907","reviewer_name":"Logan","comments":"This was one of my absolute favorite Airbnb experiences to date!

We were absolutely in love with the neighbourhood as well and would never stay in Manhattan again. Russell's apartment is a short stroll (no more than 10 mins) to the Bedford Ave subway and it's only a few stops to Manhattan. We also walked down to the ferry and caught that into Manhattan. Just loved the area and were so sad to leave. There is also a great supermarket down the road and it seemed like a perfectly safe area.

This one was disappointing for the price and did not live up to the stated promise of being \"on par with anything you'll find at any 5 star hotel\". I have never stayed in a 5 star hotel that was as noisy as this one. Yes, NYC can be noisy, but this listing should caution that the apartment (and your bedroom_ look over a 4-way intersection, and that cars, motorbikes and loud trucks will wake you til late in the night and again early in the morning. The listing also promises: \"Right off the living room is a huge private balcony\". However, two people from another unit strolled out onto this supposedly \"private\" balcony and peered directly into the apartment while I was standing in the living room in my shorts. Even if you lower the window shades, the shades do not give privacy in the living room or block out light in the bedroom. Also, I have never stayed in a 5 star hotel where the living space had not been swept or vacuumed properly. The cushion on the living room chair was badly stained, so they just flipped it over (even though it looks bad to be wrong-side up). There was no guidebook, so you have to text the owner and wait for a response to basic queries like \"Where is the gym?\" (there are no signs in the building), or how do you work the TV remotes (there are no instructions). On the positive side, the gym in the basement has all the basic equipment (bike, treadmill, elliptical, dumbbells, multi-function weight machine)."},{"_id":"261608792","date":{"$date":"2018-05-06T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2153435","reviewer_id":"71170320","reviewer_name":"Jeff","comments":"This place is an awesome place to stay wether your going to see the sites in Manhattan or want to get the Brooklyn vibe.

We’ve stayed in Manhattan’s trendiest neighborhoods countless times, and this was our first adventure in Brooklyn. So we came into this trip with a lot of unknowns...\n\nRight off the bat, during our very first night, it became clear how perfectly located Ed’s apartment is for enjoying Williamsburg. This exact block cannot be beat! Close to everything, while still quiet for a good night’s sleep. \n\nMoreover, his apartment is atop the whole complex and has the best (perhaps only) views of the Manhattan skyline, including the spacious shared patio. Epic. \n\nEverything else was totally solid. Great communicator and all around 5 star experience. Thank you!"},{"_id":"352751827","date":{"$date":"2018-11-25T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2153435","reviewer_id":"10983782","reviewer_name":"Jairo","comments":"This is an amazing place to stay, close to NYC and right in the middle of the best that Williamsburg has to offer!

Edward is very responsive and on the one occasion when I did need to communicate with him I heard back from him in just a few minutes. The check in process was flawless and the place was sparkling clean and looked very fresh and well kept. I would highly recommend this property and it is a fantastic bargain.

We loved having the little kitchenette, stocked full of everything you will need(paper towels, dish soap etc) If you wanted to prepare a meal or warm things up, it was provided  The condo had extra towels, linens, blankets and provided beach towels! We used the little cooler everyday for our outings and took along the straw mats, boogie boards and umbrellas! Seriously we didn’t have to buy any of these items! Oh and they had beach chairs! For the value and only two blocks from the beach I would definitely stay here again!

There was a security guard at night making sure no one just randomly walks into the hotel so it felt very safe. Parking is a pain though. We had to pay $30/day to park next door and that parking garage didn’t have an elevator.\n\nThis unit is okay. It gets the job done and wasn’t overly dirty or anything. It did have an overall musty smell when you walk in but the whole building smelled this way as well. The carpet should maybe be swapped out for wood floors to cut back on that. The beds were just okay. They were pretty hard so putting some mattress foam toppers would really help with that. \n\nThe lanai is small but nice. The chairs out there were not. They were very old and dirty. Some nice chairs would have been awesome to have so we could sit outside a bit and enjoy the space. It is on a Main Street (Kuhio) and there is a major bus stop right across from your lanai so it does get fairly loud, even with the AC on full blast (and throughout the night). \n\n\nOverall, it was an OK room. If I was very budget conscious I may stay there again."},{"_id":"272671056","date":{"$date":"2018-06-03T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"21541451","reviewer_id":"55853881","reviewer_name":"Ken","comments":"Overall, a nice place with a good location.  It is about a 10 minute walk to the beach, a bit more than the 1 block indicated.  Still, there were plenty of amenities, including beach chairs, beach toys, and umbrellas.  My main complaint, which AirBnB helped me with, was the lack of any indication that there was no parking available. It is listed as an apartment, so I was expecting a parking lot.  It is a private room in the Aqua Bamboo hotel, and parking is available at the hotel next door for $30 per 24 hours. This information was given to us after we called to inform the company we were at the airport.  It was a bit too late, and had I known this extra hidden charge, I'd have probably looked for someplace else.  A prompt call to AirBnB to complain resulted in a credit for the unforeseen parking charge."},{"_id":"284654159","date":{"$date":"2018-07-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"21541451","reviewer_id":"57196749","reviewer_name":"Serena","comments":"The location was amazing close walk to everything and the room was clean and loved the fact there was a kitchen to prepare our own meals if we wanted to stay in.

Check-in was fast and easy. The room is no-frills with just enough space for 2 adults and 2 teenagers. The location is awesome! Turn a corner and you can see Waikiki Beach and walk there in just a few minutes. The pool area is a beautiful oasis. Laundry facilities are on the same floor. We didn’t use much of the kitchenette but it was very nice. The only caveat: this is a privately owned room in a hotel, and boy did we feel the distinction. We knew upon check-in that we needed to call our host’s answering service and not the front desk if we needed anything. But just know you can’t participate in poolside activities or rent a dvd from the kiosk in the hotel lobby. Not a big deal - except that some of the hotel employees made us feel like unwanted stepchildren for even asking.

It is nice that this place has two  double beds,  but just one night stand, I wish they would have another one by the second bed.   Small kitchenette, we didn’t cook a lot so that was OK for us, but the refrigerator was too small.  The biggest plus to this apartment is that there was no cockroaches! Thanks! \nAt first it was a little smelly when we just walked in but after we opened the balcony and turned off AC,  The smell is gone.  We ended up not using AC for All 9  nights,  didn’t really need it.  We slept with the balcony halfway opened but for sure it was noisy, the apartment is facing semi busy road.  The balcony door was kindda  hard to open or to slide,  had To use some muscle.  There are two beach chairs available and some  inflatables:) \n We suggest it to the owner to change dressers because they are smelly inside,  we didn’t use them.   We couldn’t really use the table for eating our lunch, it was too small and the wings were bent half way down. \n Overall the apartment had everything we needed, beds were ok, clean and firm.  The  outdoor furniture for  balcony was a poor choice, wood doesn’t last long outside in the rain so that was looking dated.\n   The location is great,  Close to the beach and food pantry store, restaurants, and  international market Place .  International marketplace have shows every day at 6 PM. \n We didn’t use TV a lot, there are some channels available and the DVD player.  Laundry access on the same floor,  have some coins available.   Pool/ jacuzzi  area was great with some tables to have some coffee in the morning.  Regular Americano coffee is available at lobby for free."},{"_id":"411811139","date":{"$date":"2019-02-13T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"21541451","reviewer_id":"79636988","reviewer_name":"Polly","comments":"Mark很热心,房间位置好离海滩很近,对面就是公交车站,这个也导致有些吵,周边吃饭非常方便｡总之很满意｡"},{"_id":"412529169","date":{"$date":"2019-02-15T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"21541451","reviewer_id":"28479397","reviewer_name":"Peter","comments":"Super value for money hotel room within a complex one block back from Waikiki beach.

It had everything you would expect and much more, including beach towels, beach mats, boogie boards etc. We used the kitchen facilities often and it contained all utensils you would need for cooking, including a very good sized refrigerator. As the apartment fronts the main street there is some traffic noise but it is not overpowering and didn't affect our holiday at all. The location of the hotel is great with only a short walk to the beach, shops and restaurants. The staff at the front desk were always friendly and helpful. and all in all we had a really great time, thanks Mark."}]}

What I did arrive to was nothing in which I had prepared myself for.  The entrance was through a back alley, which I knew before, but I did not realize it would lead to a loading dock with stairs leading to a row of numbered rooms, an apartment or any type of real living conditions.  After getting to the top of the stairs, I was instantly hit with the repulsive odor of the Airbnb.  As I continued walking in, I noticed the bathroom in the dark hallway, which I instantly knew I would not be using, due to the smell getting stronger.  I still held hope for my room, thinking maybe a fellow guest had left the bathrooms a mess.  When I entered the room, I was even more disappointed.  The sheets were clearly not changed and there was hair on the pillows, the floor was disgusting, there was no window and a hole in the ceiling, and the bed was held up by crates.  The smell was just as strong in the room as it was in the entrance and hallway and I did not even feel comfortable putting my bags down.  I sent David a message that the room was not accurately listed, and I was going to find different accommodations.  I stayed at a hostel for the next few nights, only $3 more than David's Airbnb, and it was a dream compared to David's room.  Before my arrival, David was very responsive with Airbnb messages, and sent me a very detailed message regarding my self check-in.  He responded to my message about leaving his Airbnb within a few hours, offering me a different room in the same complex.  I informed him I already made different arrangements in this time, and do not see how a different room could be much better.  I asked for a full refund and he never responded.  I contacted Airbnb, and they were able to get me 1/3 of the initial payment.  Sad to say, but I do not recommend this Airbnb."},{"_id":"355596274","date":{"$date":"2018-12-04T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"21568012","reviewer_id":"220356872","reviewer_name":"Yumi","comments":"This place is good for the price!

Danny was an excellent host! He had his maid clean the place right before we arrived and each separate room in his place is equipped with a/c. The kitchen area is a little small maybe not intended for a long term stay of 6 weeks like ours was, but it’s Hong Kong and space is limited. Luckily Wan Chai is quite the gastronomic delight so we didn’t have a problem eating our meals out and finding new places all around the area to eat. Danny also gave us his personal recommendations which ended up being our favorite restaurants. I strongly recommend staying in Danny’s place if you want something clean, with a prime location and an attentive friendly host!"}]}

Seeing that Sheila was a super host as well is what sealed the deal. I knew that she must have met the high standards Airbnb sets to obtain and maintain super host status. Let me say that she did not dissapoint!!!! \n\nMy best friend and I had never been to NYC before and really had no idea what to expect. Sheila was very communicative and even checked in via text a few times to make sure we had everything we needed. We had lots of questions and she was more than happy to help in any way. The apartment was spacious and well appointed. There was fresh fruit, nuts, pretzels, milk, butter and other condiments in the fridge which was nice since we arrived in the later evening. There were groceries right around the corner at a small market which was a 3 minute walk. The entire street was lively and incredibly beautiful, filled with shops and bars and restaurants. Plan to spend some time there as it's equally cool as the rest of Manhattan.\n\nThe back outdoor area was a definite treat and a charming place to relax. We sat on the front steps on Friday night and watched all the people come home from work. I could really feel the sense of community once Sheila and Manny joined us and the neighbors came around with hugs and we all shared some laughs. I felt so comfortable and safe there at all times. We slept very well every night, even when the street was pumpin, because the apartment is the basement level and towards the back so it's surprisingly quiet. There is private access to the gardens in back and above ground windows so it doesn't feel basement-like at all.\n\nThis is the place to stay if you want an authentic New York experience with natives that really care.

They even let one of our guest keep her luggage at their place after checkout so she could enjoy the city before her late flight. \n\nLocation of Shelia and Mannys place was ideal. We bought subway passes and didn’t use them because everything we did was walkable. We were having a girls weekend full of eating, shopping, and adult beverages! If you’re planning on shows and sight seeing you’ll use the subway more than we did. The neighborhood is lively and full of good food. Check out eater for recommendations, I’ve yet to be disappointed. Shelia and Manny also supply a list of suggestions. \n\nI would recommend this location to anyone!

The kitchen may the be best appointed AirBnb kitchen I've ever experienced. Fresh flowers, fruit, plenty of Kurig coffee pods, creamer in the fridge, even some beer and wine awaited us. Impressive closet/storage space, plenty of bathroom toiletries for your convenience, and I made use of the satellite music channels on the tv while hanging out.

I knew that there were cats on the property and asked if cats were allowed in the rental where I was staying. I was told that they were not. Unfortunately in the morning the cat was at the door waiting to be allowed inside, and upon further inspection, there was cat hair in various areas (i.e. under the bed and in the corners) which was not picked up. This left me with an allergy attack which took away from two days of my vacation, in addition to the extra expense of having to find another place to stay under short notice. Stephanie was very helpful in trying to locate another place to stay in addition to refunding my money.

If you are looking for a quiet, private accommodation this is the place. Stephanie has the place well stocked and it is very artfully decorated. The large tub is a definite plus.

This is one of the quietest places we have ever stayed and even though there were other guests at the property(adjacent cottages), we had sufficient privacy. Special bonus: neighborhood cows, feral chickens and a very friendly cat passed through occasionally. Kailua-Kona waterfront and the airport are a 15-20 minute drive, and the location on Hwy 180 makes reaching destinations north and south very easy.

From the beginning, Stephanie was super helpful and the cottage was perfect for our family vacation. Our goal for our trip was to cover as much of the island as possible in 7 days, so we needed a place that was centrally located to the activities that Kona had to offer, but we also needed to be able to hit the road without having to wind through town to get to points beyond.  We also wanted to be far from the noise of Kona....We like to visit town, not stay there.  \r\nBefore our arrival, Stephanie sent us a questionnaire so that she'd know our basic needs prior to arrival and then shortly before our departure for the Big Island, she made sure we had detailed directions on how to reach their property(You have to have a car to get there.). We followed the directions and made it there with no problem, even in the dark.  Parking was easy and there was plenty of it. She lit the string lights for us on our lanai to make finding the correct cottage easy. Raj, the cat greeted us warmly, but then made himself scarce the rest of our stay. Don't let him in by the way. Stephanie is trying to keep the places allergen free for her guests. It was easy to make ourselves at home. Our 12 year old loved the loft and our 5 year old went up and down the loft ladder a lot, but we didn't allow her to sleep up there. The nights are cooler up in Holualoa, so our cottage was equipped with a little electric fireplace that worked like a charm. We miss having breakfast on the lanai every (Website hidden by Airbnb) peaceful. \r\nCommunicating with Stephanie was easy. She replaced our hot plate as soon as we told her the one we had was having a problem. We had a water issue one day and she had that taken care of by the time we got home from our next adventure. We couldn't figure out how to open our green coconut and the next thing we knew, the troops arrived to cut it open for us! \r\nWe enjoyed our stay to pieces and we had the most amazing time! What a great place! The only complaint we had was that we had no time or energy left in our days to enjoy any dance classes with Stephanie. Our kids were begging to go to bed by dark every day! Ha! \r\nWe suggested outdoor wall hooks to Stephanie and Matt before we left because of all our drippy snorkel gear and soggy towels. We hope we didn't damage their patio furniture with our wet gear..... 2 days or weeks, the Tiny Red House is the perfect home away from home!"},{"_id":"65571036","date":{"$date":"2016-03-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2160805","reviewer_id":"42426625","reviewer_name":"Xin","comments":"She was really friendly, easy to talk to "},{"_id":"76019300","date":{"$date":"2016-05-24T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2160805","reviewer_id":"47119405","reviewer_name":"Lexi","comments":"Well equipped and comfortable airbnb - quite beautiful and very unique.

Marcella has a cosy home with comfortable beds. She was a helpful host who considered all our needs and made suggestions and arrangements for us accordingly. \r\n\r\nThe house is located a short walk away from the beach and local cafes for our coffee runs. We had 12 people (so we really pushed the limits!) and Marcella helped us arrange all the beds as we needed and allowed us the use of the couch and a spare single mattress - I especially appreciated the linen and towel which was set out in the lounge room for these two; it added a friendly welcoming touch! \r\n\r\nThe comprehensive information provided in our Airbnb communications was also printed out and visible on the fridge so we didn't have to keep checking our phones. There was an ample number of power point spaces - crucial so there's no fighting over phone chargers. \r\n\r\nThe only issue we had was that we couldn't turn on the fan ventilation in the kitchen despite following the instructions and pushing on all the buttons, there was a light which indicated something was on, but no fan. It made for a pretty stuffy kitchen especially since we happened to be there when it rose to 38 degrees. We tried to open up the back door but there were too many flying insects and mosquitoes all too eager to fly in and join the feast. We made do and had an enjoyable time regardless."},{"_id":"50294953","date":{"$date":"2015-10-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2161945","reviewer_id":"41777702","reviewer_name":"Joo Young","comments":"호스트가 부재중이였으나, 메뉴얼에 따라서 체크인을 쉽게할 수 있었으며, 비치와 샵이 가까이 있어 생활하기 편리했네요..\r\n\r\n집이 다소 지저분하것 빼고는 잘 쉬다 왔습니다^^"},{"_id":"51436688","date":{"$date":"2015-10-20T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2161945","reviewer_id":"25915799","reviewer_name":"Pasha","comments":"Very easy to find house with easy access to beach and nearby amenities. \r\nKeys provided so we were able to  move in without any hassle. all bedding was clean. \r\ni was concerned about 10 adults all staying on one place, the bedroom space was excellent with everyone having enough room at night, however the living space is small and we were not able to sit together anywhere in one room which was a shame as it was a special family get together - i recommend not too many adults because of this. - dining space max 6 people. limited outdoor space to sit and eat. \r\nbesides this, it was a great opportunity to have time with people we hadn't seen for a very long time and this made up for it all\r\nthanks"},{"_id":"52206242","date":{"$date":"2015-10-27T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2161945","reviewer_id":"33545337","reviewer_name":"Jennifer","comments":"Our stay was lovely.

Loved the enviro conscious rubbish system and the full book shelf in the open kitchen/dining area. The house is cosy and our group loved the back yard to enjoy a coffee chat or our meetings together. Saying that, it would have been quite crowded to have them indoors ( rainy days?). We were there with 15 people, which i believe is too big a group for Marcella's house. The fridge capacity as well as sleeping arrangements ( if you look for average comfort in space and matresses) as well as dining space were not sufficient to host that many adults. Marcella answered to my inquiry for 'what to do?\" but could unfortunately  no find solutions to our space problems. They stayed unaddressed and no compensation was offered.

Actually house is cosy and spacious enough but it’ll be better if it is neater and cleaner. Walls are thin so big groups staying in the house can expect noise being heard anywhere in the house - you will hear people talking in the dining room downstairs and walking up/down the stairs when you are in the upstairs bedrooms.

Nos permitiu fazer um early check-in e também deixar as malas por algumas horas após o check-out. A sua recepção, ao check-in, além de muito simpática, foi cheia de sugestões e indicações sobre a cidade, incluindo locais mais econômicos para o dia-a-dia e um belo restaurante para nossa comemoração de namoro (Casa D'Oro, recomendamos!). Ela e Alexandra, quem não tivemos a oportunidade de conhecer, disponibilizam seu próprio (Hidden by Airbnb) maps da cidade, com ótimas sugestões. \n\nA cidade de Porto é encantadora e o apartamento de Catarina não está aquém. Após um lance de escadas, você encontra aquele charmoso ambiente, bem decorado, com três quartos que são alugados. Há um banheiro completo e um outro apenas com assento sanitário. Quarto espaçoso, com cama muito confortável. A região é muito tranquila, mas acontece durante a noite de passarem automóveis mais pesados que fazem mais barulho, por estar no primeiro andar acima do térreo. Está muito próximo (a pé, tudo 5-8min) de supermercados, metro, autocarros e do terminal rodoviário. Fomos andando nalgumas vezes ao centro e à Ribeira (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) min), mas porque queríamos conhecer.\n\nÚnica sugestão seria ventilador no quarto para os mais calourentos como eu, mas conseguimos ficar bem com o climatizador que havia disponível na casa. \n\nRecomendamos fortemente o quarto, o apartamento, a anfitriã, a região e a cidade. Obrigado, Catarina, pela experiência. \n\nE não menos importante:\n#gayfriendly"},{"_id":"333551054","date":{"$date":"2018-10-07T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"21624000","reviewer_id":"168411125","reviewer_name":"Paula","comments":"B N is a beautiful house very well located.

This makes messy the country in general and Rio in particular. But for this reason we were paying a specially high amount of money, more than 500 reais/night for 1 room flat.\n\nNot to enter here disputable and unsolved big issues, I mention here only three indisputable ones:\n- a complain about cleanliness (which was absolutely fine, according to former experience) and especially sand (!?) while I am paying 180Reais(!!) for cleaning 1 room\n- a complain about trash, when not a single word was told us on how to deal with it (whoever travels, knows that rules change consistently from country to country)\n- an ABSOLUTELY FALSE complain about used condoms left around, which we did NOT use at all. We left some closed ones because we were given those in Carnaval. Either this was a plain lie, or some former used condoms were found in the flat, which would make the cleanliness of the flat really low. However, we did not find any used condoms.\n\nAll those kind of complains, which I found completely bad posed, rendered my relation with the host uneasy.\n\nIn conclusion, if the period of time and your style of travel is highly fixed, and you do not specifically care about the relation with the host, probably your travel here will work without any problem and, I repeat, the location is amazing.\n\nIf, for your travel, it is crucial the hospitality and a nice and smooth relation with your host, this might be not the right place."},{"_id":"369405899","date":{"$date":"2019-01-10T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2163225","reviewer_id":"162377842","reviewer_name":"Daniel","comments":"Marcelo tiene una comunicación en más de un idioma, lo hace bueno para manejarse mejor con él. el apartamento está ideal, creo que podría decir que mucho mejor a lo que representa por fotos.

(10 nuestro caso)\nla ubicación es practicamente perfecta, a 2 cuadras de la playa (el apto cuenta con un par de sillas y sombrilla) aparte de estar realmente muy bien equipado en otros aspectos, tiene esto un plus si también tu idea es hacer playa.\nComo consejo si viajas sin datos moviles, preguntar antes de la llegada numero de telefono o numero de apartamento, para contactarlo al momento de hacer el checkin, no tuvimos esa información y cuando el portero nos hizo pasar al lobby del edificio, (dudaba si dejarnos pasar porque no teniamos mucha información) estuvimos vario rato buscando la forma de contactarnos con el anfitrión para ingresar.\nDespues de todo, fueron unas muy lindas vacaciones, el apartamento es muy comodo para ser un mono ambiente, y no le hace falta nada. sin dudas que si algún conocido vuelve a ir, le recomendaría el apartamento de Marcelo.\npara el que quiera, entrando en éste enlace y creando una cuenta, tendrá unos 30 USD gratis para su hospedaje: https://es.airbnb.com/c/danieli8000?currency=UYU"},{"_id":"401382546","date":{"$date":"2019-01-14T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2163225","reviewer_id":"10813662","reviewer_name":"Roberto","comments":"O apartamento é estilo loft, muito arejado e claro.

Walkers and joggers use the clifftop Bondi to Coogee Coastal walk, with its amazing scenery. Fun fact: Bondi Beach was a working class suburb throughout most of the twentieth century with migrant people comprising the majority of the local population.","notes":"- We only have Chromecast available on our TV as there is an issue with getting reception via an antenna in the apartment.

There are also many grocery stores you can get your supplies at: Foodland, Safeway, Whole foods. There are several drug stores like Longs nearby if your prescription runs out. \n\nAntonio kept his place well stocked with essentials such as tp, paper towels, bath towels, soap, shampoo, etc. There is a washer and dryer which we were grateful for on our extended stay. The kitchen has everything you need to make simple breakfast and meals. We made eggs and portuguese sausage or kalua pork for breakfast. We made sandwiches and loco mocos for other meals, trying to live and eat local. We visited North Shore Grinds and Brew'd for food. Leonard's is nearby for malasadas as dessert. \n\nNot pictured is a cute back yard where there is a bench, and a faucet to wash off your swimsuits, rash guard, and snorkel gear.

It's nice to be outside of the hustle and bustle of Waikiki, but close enough to drive there in 10 minutes. Having the parking space was a definite bonus as many Airbnb places within Waikiki don't include a space and finding parking there can be a major headache. It's a 5-10 minute walk to a mall and a supermarket which is very convenient, and it's also right on the freeway for getting around the island.\n\nThe place is older and could use a few updates in some areas, but overall in terms of location and value it's great. It was nice to open the house up and have the tradewinds blowing through and when that wasn't enough the AC units worked well. There is a small backyard with some seating - it's not in great shape but it's usable. Would stay here again. Antonio was great with communication as well.

You get what you pay for.  Coming from Western Canada the communication was iffy with the translation issues.  This seemed to be resolved before we left.  The host was made aware when we would be arriving...early evening.  We arrived at the door in this unknown neighborhood, and after calling and texting many times over a 2 hour period without a reply, were starting to wonder if we had been scammed.  Finally the door was buzzed open and we went to the unit.  We did not meet or see our host until the 5th night.     The  accomodations were modern, a type of industrial Ikea -look with cement ceilings and clean and simple design.   The bed is a mattress on the floor which proved to be very uncomfortable, along with terrible pillows.  There was no table and chairs to sit at, rather just a couch and chair.   The TV/cable do not work.  We asked about the tv several times during our stay via text and phone call, but were ignored without a response.  The fridge freezer motor is very loud.  There were no paper towels, or clean t towel or dish rag available., as well as no coffee maker(if you are a coffee person that is hard in the morning)  Many cupboards in the kitchen were closed off from access.  There also is no garbage can other than a small one in the bathroom.  The ad suggests and implies that you get the entire unit to use, but once there you really feel that it is just a place to sleep and shower.  Parking is a premium to find and may require several trips around several blocks before locating a spot.  This seems to be normal for Montreal and eventually you get accustomed to it.  Patience is required.  \nAll in all, it was a place to sleep, but we would not return."},{"_id":"273287908","date":{"$date":"2018-06-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"21664003","reviewer_id":"193235652","reviewer_name":"Ryan","comments":"Nice"},{"_id":"275759138","date":{"$date":"2018-06-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"21664003","reviewer_id":"184463259","reviewer_name":"Bradley","comments":"Great value and superior host"},{"_id":"278125545","date":{"$date":"2018-06-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"21664003","reviewer_id":"190503730","reviewer_name":"Graham","comments":"It is quite the commute to everything we wanted to see around Old Montreal and the Gay Village, however it makes up for it because Serge's price per night is UNREAL with how AMAZING it is.

Jaime has a great system in place for check in and her apartment building is very conveniently located near trains and buses. There are some great bedstuy restaurants nearby and the apartment has a small but extensive enough kitchen arrangement to make breakfasts and reheat leftovers. I recommend her place for a single guest or couple, as it is a bit small, but I very much enjoyed the stay!"},{"_id":"223611701","date":{"$date":"2018-01-01T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"21672349","reviewer_id":"113300083","reviewer_name":"Michael","comments":"Loved it!"},{"_id":"236177613","date":{"$date":"2018-02-18T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"21672349","reviewer_id":"49278892","reviewer_name":"Katherine","comments":"Jamie's apartment is so chic and modern.

The main strip of Lahaina is conveniently a little over a block away.  \r\nThe downside is the condo is right next to the highway. If it was on the lower level the wall would block most of the sound, but it is on the second level above the wall. I honestly never really got any sleep due to the vehicle sounds from the highway. When it was quiet the fan in the master bedroom squeaks. As I was in and out of sleep I would awaken to the alternating sounds of truck air brakes releasing and the continuous squeak of the fan.\r\nYes eventually you would get use to it, if you lived there year round.

Staying in old Lahaina is really like old Maui, not the new Kaanapali \"super hotel hustle\" feel. Aina Nalu is secluded a few blocks off Front street (the main drag in Lahaina) in a very quiet neighborhood. It literally takes just a few minutes to get to the old Banyon Tree and the harbor which are the center of all activityin Lahaina. Walking to and from is not only refreshing, but extremely convenient. Lots of shops and restaurants are super close by.\nThe unit itself is very nicely adorned with full amenities including washer/dryer combo, fridge, TV's in every room, a master suite and a 2nd bedroom. The carpet looks very new and we tried to keep our shoes/flip-flops at the door to help maintain the fresh look. The couch is quite comfy and it is just a very nice place to stay. We did not go to the pool area to swim, but it looked clean and kept up and there seemed to be people there everytime we passed by, so in good shape.\nThe Outrigger folks are friendly as well. The only down side is the parking fee which we found out is paid to the landowner not the Outrigger, so that explains they can't really give you any discounts because that is just passed on to the landowner. \nThis is a place we will definitly return to. Oh, also, if you're suba diving, Lahaina Divers is literally a block and a half away so very easy to get to, and they are amazing. \nA whole lot of Aloha going there! Great place to make your Maui vacation relaxing and memorable."},{"_id":"230267925","date":{"$date":"2018-01-27T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"216766","reviewer_id":"13605283","reviewer_name":"Jamie","comments":"The space is great!

From relaxing on some of the world’s most beautiful white sand beaches to the more adventurous undertakings of zip-lining and paragliding. The property's location is such that there are many activities and attractions right at your finger tips. Some of Maui’s top attractions are: Maalaea Harbor - 6 miles - Many boats leave from Maalaea on snorkeling trips, deep sea fishing, scuba diving, whale watching (in season), sunset cruises, and more. It is much faster to leave from Maalaea Harbor than Lahaina Harbor when taking trips to Molokini Crater and Turtle Town. Other attractions include Maui Ocean Center, Haleakala Volcano, Shops at Wailea, Iao Valley, Wailea Golf Club, King Kamehameha Golf Club, Maui Tropical Plantation, and the Whale Sanctuary. The town of Kihei is a quant, laid-back beach town boasting some of Maui’s most pristine stretches of white sand and turquoise waters. South Maui is fun for couples and families ","notes":"","transit":"Kihei is only a 20 minute commute from the Maui airport and is the perfect location if you want to explore the island.

My only complaint is that there’s no WiFi signal in the bedroom (the speed is decent in the living room) and the AC’s kind of loud so I mostly just relied on the ceiling fan instead."},{"_id":"273636660","date":{"$date":"2018-06-06T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"21702142","reviewer_id":"12620356","reviewer_name":"Aditya","comments":"NA"},{"_id":"276450988","date":{"$date":"2018-06-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"21702142","reviewer_id":"176618316","reviewer_name":"Rochelle","comments":"This was our first trip staying at Hale Kamaole and it was absolutely perfect!

We went on a snorkeling tour out of Maalea harbor, sunset sailing and a luau in Kaanapali, Big Beach, sunset on top of Haleakalā and the road to Hana. \n\nThe condo was located really close to the beach in Kihei and within walking distance to restaurants and shops. The condo itself was pretty basic in terms of design, but was clean and spacious and had boogie boards, beach chairs, snorkeling gear and a beach umbrella. Although WiFi is available, it was pretty slow and regularly disappeared and we had to log back on. \n\nOverall this place is a good value for the price and we would definitely stay here again if we come back. \n\n"},{"_id":"299395007","date":{"$date":"2018-07-30T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"21702142","reviewer_id":"164648673","reviewer_name":"David","comments":"Stayed here for two weeks.

Everything was clean and easy to access and John was quick to respond when we had an issue getting connected to the internet. We cooked breakfast every morning and made lunches to take to the beach. A boogie board, sand toys, and a set of snorkel gear was also provided for us to use. The residential street it is located on was clean and picturesque. The beach was only a short walk down a private, gated alley/walkway (which my kids loved) once you get toward the end of the path it opens up to the most beautiful beach scenery! Our favorite part of our trip was our early morning strolls to beach. When it came time to end our stay, my kids didn’t want to leave! We loved our stay here and definitely recommend it to anyone else looking for an easy getaway in Kailua."},{"_id":"247000230","date":{"$date":"2018-03-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"21702934","reviewer_id":"52016888","reviewer_name":"Meghan","comments":"Clean and modern.

We appreciated the fresh modern finishes and new appliances.  The fenced yard with well manicured grass made a great play area for our baby. John is a great host and was very responsive and even offered early check in and late check out options.  I would recommend having access to a car if traveling with a baby.

John was quick with communication and provided instructions for check-in ahead of time in case we had any questions.

There are two and a half bathrooms, a laundry machine, dishwasher and an induction cooktop, alongside an oven and a microwave; internet tv and a huge beautiful yard are great bonuses for sure.\n\nNuria, our host, was very warm and welcoming. Check-in and check out were a breeze. More importantly Nuria provided many tips and suggestions to visit around town. It was like having a private tour guide to take a virtual trip around town. We visited most of her suggested places and definitely enjoyed all of them. \n\nOne small issue is the humidity, especially downstairs, but nothing a cheap humidifier can't fix, if the host decided to get one. \n\nBoth I and my family would love to visit and stay with Casa Amarela again in the future."},{"_id":"288616092","date":{"$date":"2018-07-10T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"21711468","reviewer_id":"64102306","reviewer_name":"Joseph","comments":"Great place and location.

The kitchen has everything you need, the wifi is good, there's a first aid kit and we were welcomed with tasty Portuguese cookies. The apartment directly overlooks a football (soccer) club/small stadium and we loved watching the daily games and practices from our balcony. My daughter even participated in a practice and was invited to play in a game. The location is outside the tourist area, which we loved.  Less busy but the Metro is a short walk away, making it easy to get anywhere. We were actually able to walk to shops and grocery stores, the river, the Ribeira area, the Port Wine Cellars of Vila de Gaia and most importantly to the many declious pastry shops!

Eulalia is not an exception. Quite on the contrary. Your holidays on Porto will be even more special if you come across her and Fiona, her lovely dog. Eulalia always has a smile for you and good advices to where to go/what to do. \r\n\r\nThe house is located not far from the centre. In less than 10min walking you are in one of the main streets of Porto (Rua de Santa Catarina), allowing you to get in touch with the real Porto before reaching the touristic part. \r\n\r\nEulalia's house is cosy and tight. Her guest room has an amazing collection of books - mainly Portuguese written, so its a good excuse to start learning it. You can also appreciate Eulalia's paintings. \r\n\r\nTalk to her about art, literature, travelling, Portuguese traditions. You'll not be disappointed. And please enjoy every single piece of the amazing breakfast that she prepares you every morning.

O quarto de hospedes tem uma excelente coleção de livros – em bom português.

E, por favor, aproveite bem o pequeno-almoço delicioso que a Eulália prepara todas as manhas. Uma excelente forma de começar bem o dia.\r\n\r\n___________________\r\n\r\nLe Portugal est bien connu pour sa merveilleuse gastronomie, journées sans fin de soleil et personnes toujours accueillantes.

Her flat is extremely clean, full of light, books and pictures. The atmosphere there is really creative. \r\n\r\nDuring the night it could be a little bit noisy in the room if the window is open, but it depends on your habits. We live in a quiet district, so as I said it was a little bit noisy for us :)\r\n\r\nEulalia prepares simple but charming breakfasts. She also respects guets' privacy and leaves them alone during their breakfasts in her living room. At the same time she is very easy to talk with. So we had several wonderful conversations about literature, travels and Porto, of course. \r\n\r\nEulalia also has a dog - young, friendly and really sweet Fiona.

I couldn't sleep very good my last night to noisy for me.\nEverything that offers is there and I enjoy very much the few days in Porto."},{"_id":"106480167","date":{"$date":"2016-10-06T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"218191","reviewer_id":"95472557","reviewer_name":"J","comments":"Very clean and comfortable.

Pontos positivos: a casa e exatamente como nas fotos, um ambiente de cultura, aconchegante e excelente para descansar, alem da proximidade de pontos importantes. Outro fator que destaco e faz muita diferença em comparação com outras hospedagens que ja estive é a disponibilidade e rapidez que a Eulalia responde (muito rapida e atenta as mensagens, isso faz muita diferença). ASPECTOS DE ATENÇÃO: aqui nao e nenhum problema em si, na verdade informações ja podem estar no anuncio mas e importante reforçar: vc nao terá acesso a cozinha e nao pode comer no quarto, a proprietaria pode acessar seu quarto durante a hospedagem porque ela mantém itens pessoais nos armários e estantes, você deverar programar corretamente um intervalo de no máximo 2 horas para fazer o check-in, o banheiro é compartilhado com a proprietária para banho e não possui tranca, o sabonete oferecido para banho pode ser em pedra e ja utilizado pelo hospede anterior. (Esses pontos no meu caso nao foram negativos, a Eulalia foi muito transparente quanto a eles, no entanto chamo atencao pq sei que  para determinadas pessoas sao pontos mais sensiveis) por fim, super recomendo."},{"_id":"284373542","date":{"$date":"2018-07-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"218191","reviewer_id":"174400754","reviewer_name":"지윤","comments":"중심지에서 조금 떨어져있어서 주로 지하철로 다니긴 했지만 숙소는 너무 깨끗하고 좋았어요! 인테리어가 고풍스럽고 예뻤습니다 강아지도 너무 귀여워용 호스트분도 혹시 불편한점은 없는지 매일 잘 챙겨주셨어요~"},{"_id":"285704857","date":{"$date":"2018-07-04T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"218191","reviewer_id":"91251126","reviewer_name":"Verónica","comments":"Eulalia es una anfitriona increíble: educada y atenta, pero en la medida justa para respetar, la independencia del huésped.\nSu casa está muy limpia y cuidada,  la zona es tranquila y nada ruidosa.\nSe llega al centro caminando en unos 15 minutos, algo más si vas a zonas más alejadas de la Ribeira.

A fürdőszoba tiszta és gyönyörű,  látszik rajta Eulalia elegáns stílusának nyoma. Reggelente kicsit hangos az utca az autóktól, de amúgy nyugodt, csendes környék. Eulália nagyon kedves, kifinomult ízlésű, művelt hölgy, aki mindig szívesen beszélgetett velem, és nagyon jó tanácsokat adott a város látnivalóit illetően. A kutyái is nagyon aranyosak, barátságosak.

Great location.  They seem to have thought of every detail when designing this hostel.  Beds have privacy curtains, individual lights and fans, and mattresses are fairly comfortable.  However, this is NOT FOR LIGHT SLEEPERS! (You know who you are.)  The bar below plays loud music every night until 4 a.m.  Though the space is well insulated, nothing can block out the thumping bass (including earplugs or noise canceling headphones, which is usually adequate for me in most hostels.) The hosts are thoughtful and offered to talk to the bartenders about the noise but it still kept me up every night.  They did also offer to refund my money for my remaining night’s stay if I preferred to find a hotel due to the noise, but we ended up staying as we couldn’t find an affordable alternative.   I would recommend this place so long as you are not a light sleeper (my friend slept fine though says she’s a very heavy sleeper),  but I will probably not stay here again for that reason.  It was otherwise an enjoyable stay.  It’s a beautiful space and most folks will probably sleep fine."},{"_id":"324182933","date":{"$date":"2018-09-16T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"21865684","reviewer_id":"83264957","reviewer_name":"Pierre-Marie","comments":"Brilliant little hostel with a sense of perfection and cleanliness, all equipped, the best of its price category I've ever stayed in.

Our stay in Brazil was magical for many reasons and this apartment certainly helped facilitate that because of location, location, location. The apartment itself does look and feel much like the pictures show. It is definitely enough space for a bachelor, a couple, or a small family such as we are - two adults and a youngster. If your party is bigger than that, well more power to you, but we wouldn't recommend it. Lol.\r\n\r\nRafael's studio is conveniently located on a quiet street on the edge of a busy boulevard, not too far from the beach, public transportation, and plenty of awesome restaurants that are open at all hours for your convenience. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the building itself is undergoing repairs so the entrance and lobby look shabby, water pressure is low at times, and the electrical grid is very, very temperamental. However, the staff in the building are really pleasant and helpful and Rafael was accommodating and supportive. We were a long term stay - over a month - so we had to suffer through various planned and unplanned power outages that we otherwise may not have endured if we were just in town for a few days. We must mention, however, Rafael did right by us in stepping up to support us in times of need, it was just frustrating to have to deal with these things over time.\r\n\r\nIf the electrical situation in the building gets fixed I would whole-heartedly recommend this place to anyone including families with small children but as a mother, as the place is now, I would say it is best for bachelors, couples, or groups of younger travelers but not for families.\r\n\r\nThe AC cuts out too often, the shower generally runs cool to warm at best, and sparks fly in the kitchen from time to time making it a little less than cozy or charming during this period of renovation. Otherwise the place is very cool, well-decorated, and owned by a well-meaning AirBnB host who I can tell is a really nice guy.

Apartamento limpo, organizado, super bem localizado a 3 quadras da estação Cardeal Arcoverde do metrô, tem mercado próximo, uma feirinha de hortifrutis, farmácias, padarias e restaurantes. 5 minutinhos da praia de Copacabana, e do quiosque que vende ingresso para o Corcovado onde vc vai de van da praia até o Cristo. Vc acha táxi praticamente na porta, ônibus a todo instante e Uber chega super fácil lá. A região é bem movimentada, a avenida que passa ao lado do apê não para dia e noite mas nada que atrapalhe o sono dos justos! Roupas de cama e banho limpíssimas, e um sofá cama mais confortável que já dormi!! Tivemos um probleminha com o ar condicionado no segundo dia, mas foi prontamente resolvido pelo Rafael e sua família, então não tenho nada a reclamar!! Além do AC tem um ventilador bem potente, então quem não está acostumado não passa calor. Rafael foi super solícito via whats em todos os momentos, desde a reserva até o check out. \nJá estou providenciando minha próxima viagem ao RJ e com certeza pagarei este mesmo estúdio!!"},{"_id":"122272478","date":{"$date":"2016-12-22T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2187573","reviewer_id":"95408562","reviewer_name":"Silvina","comments":"Cerca del dpto hay tiendas para comprar lo necesario para comer, restaurantes, transportes públicos, taxis.

Some great food options for breakfast, lunch and dinner nearby.  Also just 7 minutes to the local metro. We felt safe coming and going from here even late at night.  Only thing I would say is that if you can't sleep with traffic noise then this isn't the place for you as it is 6 floors up but on a main busy road in. I'm fine with this living in a city and caused me no bother.\n\nProperty - 100% as photographed.  Clean with plenty of space for two people to stay and having. Shower was powerful and hot enough too. A/C is great and keeps the place nice and cool.\n\nRafael - Great host! Before arriving I asked about having an ironing board and although he didn't have one he ensured one was bought before my arrival. Didn't have to do that at all!\n\nRafael provides a great list of local bars and restaurants which we visited a number of and they were some of the best we visited during our stay. Bar urca after sugarloaf was a great evening, Cervantes provided a great pork sandwich for lunch and Nova Capela was a great traditional place in Lapa. The lamb is great there!\n\nDuring our stay we had some questions with regards to the cooker and shower and despite being away on holiday himself, Rafael was always quick to respond.\n\nAll in all, if you're looking for a reasonably priced apartment for carnival, or any other visit to Rio for 2, this is a fantastic choice!\n\nObrigado Rafael!"},{"_id":"139082841","date":{"$date":"2017-03-23T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2187573","reviewer_id":"93440885","reviewer_name":"Elmar","comments":"Rafael hat auf alle Anfragen sofort reagiert und war sehr hilfsbereit.

Situé au quatrième et dernier étage d'un immeuble qui surplombe l'ancien marché en face du Palacio da Bolsa, la vue est magnifique. Les nombreuses fenêtres offrent une belle luminosité et une vue à 180° sur tout le quartier historique.\r\nSa situation est idéale pour visiter Porto à pied.\r\nS'il fallait trouver un défaut ça serait l'isolation. Les fenêtres sont anciennes ce qui en fait un appartement légèrement bruyant et un peu humide.

Le climat n'était pas chaud lors de notre visite et l'appartement était globalement froid. \r\nGlobalement, cet appartement est vraiment bruyant. \r\nLa literie est moyenne (matelas et oreillers). Au niveau des sanitaires, vous aurez le strict minimum, pensez plutôt à prendre votre gel douche, shampoing, serviettes de bains voire même le papier toilette si vous restez plus de trois jours ... La douche ne s'écoule pas très bien si l'on reste trop longtemps sous l'eau.  \r\nS'agissant des communs, l'ascenseur est capricieux. Les informations reçues pour prendre possession des lieux sont très claires. Vous ne rencontrerez pas le propriétaire. \r\nBilan : ce ne sont donc pas les prestations de l'appartement en elles-mêmes qui doivent vous conduire à réserver ce bien, mais uniquement la vue et l'emplacement."},{"_id":"74728676","date":{"$date":"2016-05-16T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2187610","reviewer_id":"16176054","reviewer_name":"Jonathan","comments":"Appartement conforme à la description.
