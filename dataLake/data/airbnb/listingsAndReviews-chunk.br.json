The apartment itself was clean and well kept with plenty of room for guests to store personal items.  She had fresh towels ready for us on arrival, and the bed linens smelled freshly washed as well.  Our only complaint was that the bed was actually more of a futon than an actual bed and was a bit of a tight fit for my 6' 3\" husband and myself. That being said the mattress itself was very comfortable and we were so exhausted that we slept fine despite that.  Overall this place was sufficient for what we needed it for - a place to crash for the night.  I wouldn't necessarily have wanted to stay there for any longer than that.

Abbiamo trascorso un gradevole soggiorno presso il suo appartamento. Vicinissimo alla metropolitana. Melissa è stata molto disponibile: ci ha lasciato a disposizione attrezzi per cucinare, quanto c'era in frigo e quant'altro presente nell'appartamento. Check-in e check-out molto flessibili. Nonostante avessimo tardato per il check-in a causa di un problema con la metropolitana, lei era lì ad attenderci senza alcun problema; per il check-out ci ha consentito di utilizzare l'appartamento fino a tardo pomeriggio così che potessimo lasciare lì i bagagli per un'ultima uscita in New York.

She was always answering all my questions very fast, also during the booking-process on airbnb. Melissa even offered me a reduced price for my stay, as I stayed for a longer term. The apartment looks exactly as on the pictures, the space itself felt even bigger than on the images. The apartment is very clean and Melissa provided us with everything we needed for our stay. As the apartment faces a small inner yard, the apartment is really quiet (no street noise at all!); you can just hear a air-con from a neighboring building which didn't bother me at all. The bed was just perfect - not too big, but totally ok. There is plenty of storage in the apartment (two wall closets, two dressers). The location couldn't be more perfect: the C train is just around the corner, the G and all atlantic terminal trains are just a few blocks away. There is even a citibike-station just around the corner as well. On several streets around the apartment there are plenty of good grocery stores (try out Mr. Melon) and restaurants (try Chuko). I enjoyed my stay at Melissas place very much and would definitely recommend her place!

The apartment is equipped with everything a traveler would need, even for a long stay and the old heating which is a bit noisy sometimes works properly.

One is very old, sick and can't walk so toilet issues are a problem.  I discovered that she had showered the dog in the same shower as I was using (only one shower) to wash off faeces and urine.  As they don't go outside to toilet, the smell was an issue, as poo and pee would sit on the newspaper all day.  The mattress had blood and sweat stains, so slept with my sarong over the sheet.  I think these issues need to be addressed before she continues to do Airbnb.  As I said, she is. lovely person, but I only stayed four out of the seven nights I booked, as preferred to stay with friends rather than sleep on the mattress."}]}

De plus, pour moi qui adore marcher, la location de l'appartement - a 2 minutes de Taksim - était parfaite pour visiter tout Istanbul en se baladant.\r\nL'appartement de Ceylan ressemble exactement a ses photos: il est très beau, épuré, et lumineux. Le bonheur, ça a été de pouvoir prendre un thé et fumer une cigarette sur sa terrasse au soleil le matin. La chambre était très bien aussi, très cosy! Et très important: le lit était confortable et j'ai très très bien dormi chez Ceylan. \r\nLa situation de l'appartement \r\nComme je le disais a Ceylan, mon séjour chez elle a vraiment représenté tout ce que j'attends de AirBNB: de belles rencontres et un moyen de découvrir de nouvelles villes différemment.

She has very precise instructions on how to get to her flat so you won't get lost!  Very easy to follow. My one piece of advice is that you pack light.  Her flat in Taksim is on the 3rd floor (in American minds that means the 4th floor, as the ground floor is ground zero). Anyway, there is no elevator and I had just been traveling from somewhere else and had a huge and heavy suitcase with me.  PACK LIGHT.  That is my big advice for everyone.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this flat is a perfect location.

The apartment is a great location, right off of Taksim square (the walk from the Havantas shuttle wasn't bad, but difficult in the heat with my bags and stairs...). Quiet neighborhood off the main busy streets, and not close to a mosque for the calls to prayer. Really cute street with horsedrawn carriage vegetable cart!\r\nThe apartment is beautiful, shared space is great, fast wifi (mostly in the living room, not as good in the bedroom with the door shut). The kitchen was great for cooking things and she has a easy to use washer always a must for travelers!\r\nThe room was fine, bed was comfy, albeit quite hot. The airconditioner is in the living room, so to keep the room cool when I slept, I needed my door wide open. In the summer months, the a/c is a must.\r\nCeylan didn't stay in the apartment while I was there, there were other airbnb guests in the other rooms. But they were nice.

That also means that, you can come across any type of people around the vicinity ranging from tourists to locals as well as unfortunately the refugees that live on the street. When I first got there, as i only put the street name without the door number on (Hidden by Airbnb) maps, i went through multiple streets that looked dodgy to the eye with many homeless refugees around. Do not make the same mistake i made, as i got lost in those streets and started freaking out. Put the building number as well while trying to find the flat and you will see it is located right below the main road (Gumussuyu) next to five star hotels. The proximity of the flat to the transport links dazzled me once i went out to discover the vicinity. The restaurants, bars, shops, everything is within 10 min walk tops. I stayed in the smallest room in Ceylan's flat and it was good for one night stay. However if you have a massive suitcase, i would strongly advise you to book one of the larger ones, i have seen them, quite beautifully decorated and spacious, as you may not fit your suitcase in the tiny room. Ceylan was great, literally went out of her way to get me the keys, postponing her plans to meet up with me at a place of my convenience. Strongly advise anyone to have a decent and economical stay in Istanbul, better than staying at hotels especially if you dont want to constrict yourself in a room and feel the comfort of home:))"},{"_id":"105540259","date":{"$date":"2016-10-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3237666","reviewer_id":"97263521","reviewer_name":"Mohamed","comments":"Everything as described, Ceylan is very good, honest and helpful person ..

Actually I preferred sleeping on the floor with my camping mat and it was better. Ceylan is not living in this house nor did she stopped by or checked/messaged if everything was ok. During my 3 day stay she only communicated me on the checkout day and asked me what time I was leaving. \r\n\r\nThe ugly: There were 2 other guys in the house which both were noisy and very unfriendly towards me. Ceylan told me about them but did not introduced us. Since they would not talk to me I do not know their history but It looked like nobody took their consent about airbnb and they were not happy about it.

It's conveniently in between Findikli and Taksim square, so there's easy access to the metro and the tram. This works better than being closer to Taksim where you can only get the metro, which doesn't go directly to the old town. Using the tram you can get to Sultanahmet in 15 minutes. The apartment is also a brief walk from lively Istiklal street and all the food of Asmali Mescit. There is excellent nightlife in those areas.\nWhile I was there, I used one room and the other two rooms also had visitors. So the atmosphere in the apartment was very much like a small hostel. There is ample space in the living room for people to hang out. There's a small kitchen but I stayed for only a few days so didn't get to use it. The bathroom is shared between everyone.

Utensils and plates were greasy and almost unable to be washed, so I did not use them because they were disgusting.

I had to squat at all times while showering and when I would step out of the shower, I literally felt like stepping in a big puddle.

The apartment offers what you need...and more! Daniela really cares about her guests and is such a lovely person. My best friend and I already visited NYC a year ago. We were looking for an alternative program this time (not the typical tourist sight seeings...). Daniela always had cool ideas about nice places and shows to visit or where to get a delicious meal. Her husband also gave us some good ideas about what to see or where to go.\r\nBoth times we visited NYC we stayed in Brooklyn. It's a very nice and safe borough with loads of things to do. Commute time to another place in Brooklyn or to Manhattan is approx. 1 hour (sometimes more, sometimes less...of course, it depends where exactly you want to go...), which is absolutely normal in New York. The subway offers good connections from Daniela's place and you can even use different lines. One subway is approx. 5-7 minutes and the other one approx. 10-15 minutes away (by foot).\r\nWe also liked that there were other two rooms (therefore other guests) in the apartment. We had some funny and interesting conversations with people from all over the world.\r\nAnd last but not least: Thanks to the AC we slept very well (summers in NYC can be very hot).\r\nThanks again for having us, Daniela! :-)"},{"_id":"20085079","date":{"$date":"2014-09-23T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3261569","reviewer_id":"17420013","reviewer_name":"Fabrizio","comments":"Good location near subway"},{"_id":"20454136","date":{"$date":"2014-09-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3261569","reviewer_id":"21239150","reviewer_name":"Susana","comments":"It's a beautiful place to stay and rest after a day on the streets of the Big Apple: clean, tidy with all amenities.

The apartment was clean, cozy and conveniently located within walking distance of the A an C lines and some good places to eat. There's easy and safe parking, too, which was something we were grateful for, having driven up from NC. We went to two of the restaurants she had marked on a map that's on the fridge, and both of them were PHENOMENAL (the pizza place and Peaches). \r\n\r\nThe room looks just like the images — the three of us stayed in the one with a single and a double bed and had plenty of room. I also appreciate a room with lots of light, so I loved having those two windows. The rest of the apartment was beautiful and clean, as well. It was a great place to come back to every night after a long (and in our case, wet and cold) day walking around the city.\r\n\r\nDaniela is quick to respond to messages and had some helpful recommendations for things to do in the city that made our stay easier and more fun. We met in person briefly a couple of times, and she was lovely.

The room is exactly as described and very comfortable. The beds are spacious and firm, and I had an enjoyable night's sleep each night of my stay. The room was relatively quiet for its location and I didn't have any trouble with noise. Access to the bathroom can be problematic at times, but there is a sign up for shower times in the kitchen that helps alleviate any problems.\nThe location is excellent, and is located near two subway stations with access to any part of the city. We took the train into the city each day and didn't have any problems. You can be in Manhattan in 20 minutes. We drove a car and had a little trouble finding a place to park but found one a few streets down. Make sure to check for fire hydrants and signs for restricted parking.\nDaniela was an excellent host, always responding to messages quickly. She is very helpful. During our stay another guest had a problem with their room and she was quick to provide assistance and solve any problem. If you get a chance, stay with Daniela. She will make your stay perfect "},{"_id":"34920352","date":{"$date":"2015-06-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3261569","reviewer_id":"20337412","reviewer_name":"Tira","comments":"Very warm welcome from host.
