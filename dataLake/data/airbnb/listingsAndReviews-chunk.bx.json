Cozy, clean, and in the heart of Williamsburg. She had anything and everything you need to make yourself comfortable. she didn't bother us but was eager to help i.e. suggest great food places when we asked. Even though we didn't meet her face to face, the experience was smooth, completely convenient and secure especially for two young ladies roaming around NYC.

Our favorites were Joe's Pizza across from Fabian's coffee shop, brunch at Sweet Chick and Rosamunde's Sausage Grill. \nKatie is helpful and we got all help we needed. \nIf you are traveling to JFK airport try booking UBER since other taxis cost about $42. \nHope you enjoy staying there, we would definitely go back ! :) "},{"_id":"89706095","date":{"$date":"2016-07-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6225501","reviewer_id":"52249672","reviewer_name":"Katherine","comments":"I've lived up in New York for 7 years, now back in the South where I grew up. Two of those years was spent in Brooklyn, one of my favorite places on earth. I knew when I was planning my trip that I would prefer to be around Bedford Ave in Williamsburg. Finding Katie's apartment was awesome it was in the exact location I wanted to be, right near the L, you can't find a better spot. Katie's apartment is an absolute gem. It's near some of the greatest food and bars not only in Brooklyn, but the whole island of Manhattan (**make sure to try Rabbit Hole's eggs benny if you're a brunch lover). Her bed and that lovely couch were so comfortable and inviting to come back to after a long day walking around. My sister and I had everything we needed for our stay and she was incredibly quick with responding to any questions we had about key pick up and drop off. Thank you Katie for letting us live in your world for a little while, what a fun place to be!!! Rent this place ladies and gents, you will NOT be disappointed.

The apt is close to Waikiki beach but the building is dank and run down. I was not thrilled with the roaches that greeted me as I opened the microwave door each morning or the kitchen cabinets. I understand that Hawaii has a lot of roaches on the Island we can’t always control what our neighbors do. It is extremely difficult to control each facet of an apartment especially when you are out of town. The cleaning service was mainly to blame for the bugs.I entered the apartment and opened a cabinet door to find opened chips and other snacks left over from the last guest. There was grime and filth next to the garbage, fridge and stove. The cabinets were sticky and the counters weren’t properly wiped down. The one good thing I can say about my experience was that Joanna and Dave were sympathetic to our plight and send an exterminator and an extra deep cleaning service.

That said I think the place can be a bit cleaner and less musty. There is only one air conditioning unit, which means one of the bedrooms isn't air conditioned. But all this said, the apartment is decent for a short period of time. Having a kitchen, washer and dryer while on vacation is fantastic, after all.\n\nThe main thing that made our stay a bit weird was Derek's communication. My mother, who I was traveling with, asked if we could have a few more beach towels as there weren't enough for the 4 of us. After he said that he didn't, my mother texted that he should probably have more. Granted, I have no doubt that my mother's tone could have been better. But I don't think it excuses his response. In response he called her, mad that she texted rather than called (it was late), raised his voice and said things like \"I don't have a thousand towels to give you.\" The conversation ended with him hanging up on her. The experience made us avoid communication with him for the rest of our stay.

My friend and I spent 4 weeks here and it truly could not have been a better, more comfortable stay. Derek is so sweet and helpful, and was always very easy to reach via text/call. \n\nPros:\n-Quiet but literally 1.5 blocks from all the hustle and bustle (restaurants, bars, ABC stores, groceries, shopping, beach, etc.)\n-Gated very secure building. We kept the front door open most days while we were home and the worst thing that ever happened was we had an adorable toddler come visit us\n-Balcony with table/chairs and a gorgeous view of the canal\n-All kinds of beach supplies (chairs, umbrella, snorkel gear, floaties, beach towels)\n-In unit washer/dryer\n-Fully stocked kitchen (pots, pans, dishes, coffee maker, toaster, blender, etc, even some tupperware and plastic/paper supplies)\n-One sink in each room (shower/toilet are shared)\n-Reserved parking space in gated lot\n\nCons:\n-Mattresses are fairly firm (plus or minus depending on your preference)\n-The smaller bedroom has shutters separating it from the kitchen/living room. My friend and I had similar schedules so this was never an issue but the shutters really don't block out any sound.\n-WiFi is not the fastest. Pages take a second to load. We were able to stream Netflix some days, other times not at all.\n-There's only 1 AC unit and it's in the master. While I was very concerned about this before our trip, we hardly ended up using it. If you open the front and balcony doors, there's there's a strong cross breeze that cools the apartment well. Also there's a large fan in the smaller bedroom which I used at night.\n-You can't receive mail/packages here"},{"_id":"152091154","date":{"$date":"2017-05-14T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6262269","reviewer_id":"2046621","reviewer_name":"Pavel","comments":"It was a great vacation.\n\nDerek met us at the airport and took us to the apartment.\n\nHe showed us the place where we will live, answered our questions, advised the places that should be visited.\n\nThe presentation was excellent, we immediately liked the apartments.\n\nThe location of the apt is very convenient, a few minutes walk to the ocean, in the neighborhood there are several shops, at night it is very quiet, so nothing will interfere with your sleep.\n\nThe apartment is fully consistent with the photos.

Her responses prior to our visit were fast, informative, friendly, and thorough. From the very beginning of our conversations to the end of our stay, she was helpful and available. Prerna went above and beyond by giving us numerous local recommendations for attractions, dining, etc...and even left some yummy cookies for us upon arrival with our check-in information! The apartment was clean and as described in the listing.  We were happy to have a doorman and an elevator in the building - very safe and convenient! Everyone we encountered on building staff were also very helpful and friendly. The apartment was a perfect fit for my husband and I. It was extra spacious for an NYC studio apartment with a well-appointed kitchen, dining, living, \"bedroom\", and bathroom. Prerna has done a nice job of creating separation and privacy between the bedroom area and the living area, which was a plus! The bed was comfy. We had all the linens we needed and access to dishes, internet- based TV services and wifi without any problems. There was a lot of natural light, and the apartment was centrally located within walking distance of Times Square (7-10 blocks), Central Park (about 7 blocks) and theatres (1-8) blocks. We walked or took public transit everywhere. No need for cabs unless you just want to use them. Overall, a wonderful experience and would recommend this listing highly to others!"}]}

You've even got chic clothing boutiques, hip coffee shops, and parks in case you want to take a jog. Don't know where to find the boutiques? I'll circle them on the map for you. THIS IS STILL A VERY \"LOCAL\" NEW YORK SPOT. In fact, you can see the transition taking place right now. Is it safe? YES. There's a primary school across the street. You'll hear the kids playing when you're outside when school is in session. There's also a police department a few blocks south east. In general, New York is pretty safe. The movie depictions are pre-1990's The Williamsburg bridge is right nearby for a relaxing walk over the water!

He sent a packet of very detailed info that not only helped me find his place, but to get around, have things to do, etc. \nI was there with two short days to find an apartment of my own and he actual volunteered some advice and helped me know which trains to take.

As such, it's the perfect place for travellers who have never in the US or NYC before. A lot of information provided and Tanner is extremely helpful, friendly and communicative. If you're worried about being a big city, Tanner is a great host who will guide you along. This was also the cleanest Airbnb I've been in, with many amenities provided. The bed was extremely comfortable and the shared living place was a great place to relax after a day out in the city. The location was personally ideal for me as well! Secluded enough from the noise of NYC but also easily accessible to the best of the Lower East Side (Chinatown, Little Italy and the East Village are all walkable). The Williamsburg Bridge is right outside, as well. Depending on the time of the year, I'd definitely recommend doing a run or walk on it and exploring Brooklyn on the other side.

You can already see that he is a considerate person from the very detailed listing. Well, everything matches exactly what is advertised and this level of detail and consideration persists throughout the stay. He provided a ton of information (in the form of a house manual, instructions for check in, tips on getting around the city, etc) that helped us have a smooth stay and enjoy the city a lot. The apartment is very clean and the bed is comfortable. The eletronic lock is convenient for check in and check out. Although we didn't stay around the neighborhood much, it seems quite nice. We never felt unsafe, even arriving at 2-3 AM by subway. It was a pleasant experience overall and my wife and I would definetly stay at Tanner's place again."},{"_id":"242313405","date":{"$date":"2018-03-11T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6262821","reviewer_id":"55603931","reviewer_name":"Katie","comments":"Tanner was a brilliant host - I’d definitely recommend staying here!

It was the perfect launching point for all the things we wanted to do in Manhattan and Brooklyn. It felt so safe to stay here, being right across from a school and a police station. You have your own basement entrance and your own half bathroom. The shared TV room is also in the basement next to your room, but Tanner nor his roommate came down to watch TV during our stay. It was very private! The only \"inconvenience\" is that the shower is upstairs on the first floor and you have to share with Tanner and his roommate. This is CLEARLY stated in Tanner's description, so I do not have any issue with this-- just want to point it out again. Also, there is NO closet in the room and again this is clearly stated in the description. He does have  a hanging bar with hangers where we put our clothes. Tanner is very quick at responding and went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable!

The apartment itself is a small self-contained studio in the basement of a nice building - bigger than many NYC hotel rooms, though not very spacious. The bed is incredibly comfortable, and shower excellent. Cooking facilities quite basic (kettle, microwave, fridge) but perfectly adequate for our needs, i.e. just breakfast and occasional snacks. Extremely quiet location but very close to lots of shops, restaurants etc. The area to the west towards Graham Ave. and beyond is great (Williamsburg) but going east less so. We really enjoyed our stay and also found it very convenient for Manhattan, just a few stops on the L subway line.

Abbiamo comunicato esclusivamente via email (per comodità), e Michael ha sempre risposto nel giro di pochi minuti. Lo studio è carino e accogliente, molto pulito e dotato di quello che serve (asciugamani morbidi e abbondanti, saponi e shampoo, anche un microonde e un bollitore), armadio a muro, e riscaldamento a pavimento. Bagno grande, pulito e moderno. Si tratta però di un interrato, quindi la luce viene solo dalla portafinestra di ingresso. Inoltre, il pavimento è in cemento (con tappeti), il che guasta un po' l'atmosfera. D'estate potrebbe diventare parecchio caldo, ma c'è l'aria condizionata e un ventilatore. Il quartiere è tranquillissimo e di notte non si sente un rumore (che, per NY, è incredibile). Lo studio si raggiunge in 5' dalla fermata Grand St della L, camminando lungo la Powers (la strada consigliata da (Hidden by Airbnb) è meno indicata). Il quartiere non offre un gran che, ma già a qualche blocco di distanza si arriva a Soho e Noho che sono molto più carini. Per arrivare a Manhattan ci vogliono circa 30', da casa a Time Square, via metro. Noi siamo rimasti 3 giorni, e dopo un po' di disorientamento iniziale, che credo sia inevitabile per chi arriva a NY per la prima volta, siamo rimasti molto contenti della posizione dello studio, in quanto è comoda al centro, servita dalla metro a tutte le ore, in un quartiere tranquillo e silenzioso. Noi siamo sempre rientrati dopo mezzanotte e non abbiamo avuto alcun problema ne' in metro ne' per strada. Michael è stato anche disponibile a tenerci le valige l'ultimo giorno, anche se abbiamo lasciato l'appartamento la mattina. Le abbiamo recuperate la sera, in quanto lo studio è lungo il tragitto in metro per andare verso al JFK."},{"_id":"124360202","date":{"$date":"2017-01-01T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6269517","reviewer_id":"99938633","reviewer_name":"Suzan","comments":"Michael was a great host.

When I arrived, there was none to be found until I called and spoke to a girl who spoke english and gave me a tip.  Would have been helpful if I got this in the original emails.  \r\nSecond, the room is some walls built up in the middle of the small apartment, with about a foot or two of open space at the top.  Therefore, you can hear everything.  They built an air conditioner, but the hot air went out to the main apartment and then this just blew up over the space at the top of the \"walls\".....very strange.  \r\nThird, I counted about 6 people living there.  One of them spoke some english, so it was a full space of people and kind of hard to communicate.  There is one bathroom and at one point there was a line for it.  Again, you can hear everything, even over the \"air conditioner\", and a few of these people were talking late and cooking early in the morning.  I didn't sleep, and was only there for one night of sleep before my flight.   This was also due to the fact that the bed was as hard as a rock.  :(\r\nFinally, the internet went in and out, which I only used for about an hour.\r\nI think people should be aware of what they are getting, which is why I'm sharing my experience.  \r\n"},{"_id":"41248730","date":{"$date":"2015-08-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6269968","reviewer_id":"31854578","reviewer_name":"Momo","comments":"The host family was very nice.

There is no ceiling, only 4 wooden planks cobbled together to make 4 walls ... thereby having an intimate moment is absolutely impossible: the Chang family hears you and you constantly hear. There is no ceiling, so we constantly feel the smell of food in your room: This IS DISGUSTING !!It is IMPOSSIBLE to sleep !!! From the first night we are annoyed because they turn on the light at 4am, and they do not die !! NO RESPECT ! Besides the snoring of the Chang family ...There are people who enter the house early in the morning, or a big bell in the middle of the afternoon when you go rest. They excrement DIRTY! We hear the spitting, burping and farting is AWFUL! And that's from morning to night ...They are very uncommunicative they hardly understand English ...the positive aspect: NOTHING !!!! \nWe had a HORRIBLE stay with them! Do not go!

It quite possibly was just a box spring. Might as well have slept on the floor. The prior reviews are correct in that the room is very small and in the living room constructed out of plywood panels, providing visual privacy but no auditory privacy. The host, however, was very nice and responsive in communication prior to checkin. Limited street parking but lucked out finding a spot after circling several times around. If rickety elevators are a phobia of yours, this is not the place for you. The kitchen also stunk of old/rotting food the next morning, so we got out early... But, we booked this place because it was cheap and 2 miles away from Citi Field, so it fulfilled its purpose. However, I would not stay here again.

To make matters worse the man doesn't speak a lick of English so it's hard to communicate with him. He should post this problem in his ad.

So first the host speaks Chinese I think and since I didn't need to communicate much it was fine with me. Room looks much nicer in photos. It's like a box 14x14 the room itself is just created with wooden walls in the living room and made into a room. The top of the walls are open so you can hear everything from the other room, kitchen and bathroom. Host was an old man and nice showed where everything was during check in. So the noise is an issue you can hear everything pretty much like there was no walls at all. The door had a lock and key but when I closed it and locked it I could easily pull/push it open and is pretty much not even a lockable door. BE AWARE The bed is hard as fk, I think it's just a mattress topper with no mattress. It was pretty uncomfortable to sleep and even lay down in. Room is a small box with lamp and a standing lamp. At night it got cold the heater didn't work in the room had to use all three blanket type covers to sleep. Bathroom was acceptable and kitchen didn't use much at all. Pros: cheap, location, visual privacy, nice host Con: Uncomfortable bed, not considered rooms more like cardboard boxes, zero noise reduction in rooms, unlockable door. Overall cheap place to crash for a night and the host told me to give them 5 stars  and good ratings. Think this place has good ratings because the host is an old man and didn't want to give an honest review.

The apartment was in the walking distance from the main st metro station and was pretty easy to find. We got there close to midnight, but the host waited and welcomed us. He gave us some suggestions on the nearby dining and shopping places the next day. The price is also very affordable and hard to beat in the flushing area. The only thing is that the walls weren't very sound proof and we could hear someone talking in another room, but that didn't bother us too much. Would love to stay there again next time we go to flushing, NY.

Cali has been very kind with my request about time of check in and out. The bedroom is spacious, quiet and clean. Location is perfect, I already knew neighborhood I chose for that reason.

Checking in was odd. Was supposed to check in at 3pm and was asked around 11am that same day if I could come at 6:30pm. I was on my way into the city and needed to check in at 3pm. She said she wouldn’t be home until 6:30pm but when I arrived around 3:30pm she was home and then I left around 5:30pm and she had never left. She was there the whole day. But told me she wouldn’t be home till 6:30pm. It also took her a very long time to respond to my messages when I was trying to tell her I needed to check in at 3pm. Which was just irritating. Then she said that she would message me instructions and leave a key. I never got any instructions and when I messaged her again because I was at the apartment she said she was home and to just buzz and come up. I did get in around 3 30pm so I was grateful she let me in but didn’t appreciate the stress of her possibly not letting me in until 6:30pm. I had tickets to a show at 7pm. If this had been discussed with me prior to that very day I would’ve made different arrangements. It took her two hours almost to respond to me and every time before that at least a half hour. And I was on a schedule. She also had a family member sleeping on the couch the whole time who in the mornings took an awfully long time in the bathroom. And then my last night there Cali herself was on the couch with her family member because she had rented out both her rooms. So instead of two people there were four. Which is just too much. And awkward. When I use Airbnb I usually stay in cheaper places out in queens and Brooklyn but thought I’d treat myself and spend a little extra money to stay on the island and on the upper west side. I’ve had infinitely better stays at the cheaper places and found this to be more stress than enjoyment. It was also clear that the room I was staying in had somebody else in it when I was not there, which I really did not appreciate. The bathroom was a mess. Hair all over the place. Crumbs and other dirt on the floor of the bedroom and kitchen. It was just a mess. She’ll say otherwise about all this and I can’t help that. But I’m not picky. I always leave 5 Star reviews because i just appreciate someone opening their home for me to stay in. If it’s a messy place at least make the person feel welcome. In this particular instance I felt incredibly unwelcome and felt more like an inconvenience than a guest paying to stay at the apartment. The area was incredible though. Very close to the train with lots of restaurants and shops around.

My experience wasn’t that great - she left the keys in a lock on the grate around a tree on the street side, which was really hard to find with street parking and tons of trash bags around. I called twice, no answers, after standing downstairs for 20 mins she finally got back to me saying she was in a movie, and sent me a few brief directions. It was dark I can barely see anything around the tree. The trash bags were piled high around which didn’t help either. So I basically had to dig into the trash bags to search for the keys. People were giving me weird look it was quite embarrassing. Out of curtesy I texted her after getting in, to apologize I wasn’t able to keys in the first place, no response. And after I left the house the next morning, I text her that I left the keys in the room, no response again.

When we got into the apartment, it was messy and there were no clean sheets and I had to go through a pile of dirty laundry trying to figure out which sheets were clean, which was a very gross experience. The bathroom was not clean and the sink and shower do not drain properly and there was hair in the bathtub and the trash was not emptied. When cali arrived the day we were checking out she did apologize and cleaned the place and was nice enough to let us keep our luggage there for the day as we ran some errands in the city, but overall, it had been the worst experience in airbnb for me mainly due to the unsanitary conditions. There was also another 2 guests staying at the apartment who were equally as frustrated and asked us to clean the hair out the shower (it wasn’t ours as we are black and it was Caucasian hair). \n\nOverall, Cali is a nice person and apologized for the condition her apartment was in, however she did not meet expectations with her hosting skills and I would hope she would not let this happen again in the future.

Cali wasn't there since she was traveling.  The couple who previously booked the room were still there when I arrived, and they mentioned that the apartment was already dirty when they arrived 5 days earlier, and there had been no cleaning service at all.  They mentioned that multiple people had booked the 2 bedrooms in the apartment while Cali was out of town, so by the time I got there, both bedrooms were dirty, there were no clean sheets on the bed and the bathroom was dirty.   What's worst is that Cali seemed completely unapologetic for that.  Even the Airbnb support staff who reached out to her told me that she seemed unconcerned about the situation I was in.  Her attitude was pretty much: \"oh well, please cancel\".  She did not acknowledge the immense inconvenience of having to look for and book another place that same evening.  Airbnb support staff tried to help me find another place but there was no where else available that same night in the vicinity for the same price range that also had an elevator (I had heavy luggage to carry).  I therefore walked a few blocks to buy clean sheets and Airbnb reimbursed me for it.  Thankfully, I only needed to stay 2 days in the messy apartment.  The words \"sorry for the mess\" did not come out of Cali's mouth (via text) until the day I checked out.  The apartment is in a good location and relatively spacious by New York standards, but the lack of cleanliness and painful check-in process was not worth it."},{"_id":"339986743","date":{"$date":"2018-10-22T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6270767","reviewer_id":"144929581","reviewer_name":"Nikki","comments":"Well described, great location, good neighbourhood with easy access to the sights of NYC.

It has a lovely, unobstructed view of the pool and the ocean. It is wonderful to relax on the lanai and hear the waves break on the rocks. The beach is small and not for everyone as the lava rocks need to be negotiated, a bit tricky if surf is high. However, we found a wonderful beach minutes away with a grassy park, large welcoming sandy beach and wonderful snorkeling. I spent a half hour swimming along with a turtle one day. There are also turtle to be found right in front of the condo. Deb alerted us to local events, steered us to other beaches, stores and local events. The layout of the condo is perfect for two friends, the kitchen has everything. After dinner, it was lovely to go out to the lanai and enjoy the stars and the moonlit sea. Mahalo, Deb, for 9 days of delight. I will be back. Soon, I hope.

Paga a tiempo lo acordado Si llega el día del pago del alquiler, no te retrases en hacer los pagos o transferencias. 2.  Mantén la limpieza y el orden en la cocina Cuando uses algo, intenta que se quede después tal cual estaba. Por ejemplo, si vas a coger una sartén y tú la has encontrado limpia, ¿se la tiene que encontrar sucia el siguiente? Si todos mantenéis esta regla en casa, la convivencia será mucho mejor. Ya que el apartamento dispone de lavavajillas, cuesta el mismo trabajo dejarlo en la pica que colocarlo en su interior y por supuesto colocarlo en su sitio después del lavado. 3.

The flat is confortable and is full of natural light in the living room and the kitchen the whole day long. The exterior room is also light-filled, especially in the morning. The kitchen, although it doesn't look recently refunished, it has all the commodities and it's clean and confortable. There's a dish-washer, a senseo coffee machine, a washing machine which can be programmed to start even in an 8h time, oven, microwave, mixer, mincer and all you can need to make your cooking easy. It has heating and air-conditioning and the house gets warm very fast. The mattress is fine, you won't end up with a back-ache after sleeping there. You have a pretty spacious wardrobe and he will give you the towels and sheets for change without having to ask for them. The bathroom is very confortable, recently refurnished, clean and has a window. The temperature inside the bathroom is warm, the water goes out with good pressure and temperature and there's a hanger for the shower head.\r\n\r\nThe host is a generous, open and kind guy who will make you feel at home and will make you feel free to use all spaces at home, to turn on the heating (unlike other places in Barcelona) and use whatever you need as many times as you need. I happened to fell sick 3 days after arriving and he even went to do a small shopping for me to have sth to eat and he boiled some rice for me. He is flexible and willing to listen what whatever input you want to make. \r\n\r\nThe house is located in a building with lift. The neighbourhood is safe, quiet, although humble and there's no neighbourbood feeling. Around the corner, literally, so 2-min away, there's a supermarket open until 21:00 and 2 streets away there's another Spanish supermarket which open until 1:30 in the night or so. \r\n\r\nAlthough you won't be right at the city center, the area is well communicated. The flat is 6 minutes away from metro line 2 which will bring you in 10 minutes to Sagrada Familia, in 15 min to the city center (Passeig de Gracia), and in 20 min to Diagonal - Provença, a key metro - train (Rodalias) hub. Very convenient.\r\n\r\nYou have to know that the bedroom window opens to the kitchen, to the sink, more precisely. You may need earplugs if you're not an early bird, but the host is very thoughtful and won't turn on the washing machine or the dish washer if you're in bed, unless you insist that it doesn't mind. Since you can spend all your time at home in the living room, this is a minor thing. Nevertheless, he has another exterior room you may choose, instead. \r\n\r\nAvoid this place if you are orange-colour averse! ;P \r\n\r\nEnjoy your stay! ;)"},{"_id":"71973400","date":{"$date":"2016-04-30T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6314518","reviewer_id":"62753093","reviewer_name":"Miguel","comments":"La estancia, por lo general, estuvo bien.

Il prezzo della casa è competitivo rispetto alle altre strutture in città e la posizione è ottima se non si ha bisogno di vivere in centro (metro a 2 minuti a piedi). La camera corrisponde esattamente alle foto, ma avevo sottovalutato il fatto di non avere una finestra che desse verso l'esterno. La camera è infatti completamente interna. Per far entrare un po' di luce è stata creata una finestra che affaccia sulla cucina, esattamente all'altezza del lavandino, per cui gli odori di cucinato inevitabilmente entrano e faticano e disperdersi per mancanza di altre prese d'aria. Questo sicuramente il limite principale della sistemazione. Javier è un host assolutamente raccomandabile.

In addition to stocking the fridge, pantry and bathroom with essentials, she *hand-drew* a walking map of the area that included her personal suggestions for restaurants, grocery stores and coffee houses (all spot-on, by the way). The apartment was beautifully appointed including Netflix access, towels, bedding...just everything we could possibly need. Dana and her darling son showed us around, gave us tips about the area, and Dana made herself 100% available to us at any time should we require assistance. \r\n\r\nWe really enjoyed our time in New York, but our experience with Dana has solidified in us a desire to use Airbnb exclusively in all our trips to come.

The place is exactly like the photos.  I found the apartment spacious, clean and conveniently located.  It is near two subway stations and easy to get around.  Dana will provide you with assistance about supermarkets, shops etc nearby.\r\n\r\nI spent a lot of time in Manhattan and often traveled home very late at night (midnight or later).  As a single woman traveling around, I would however recommend exercising some caution if walking around the neighbourhood very late.  So I took an uber and taxi all over the place.  I know that Dana will tell you that it's quite safe and it probably is, but I felt safer uber-ing after midnight as I was alone and carrying many shopping bags!  Once or twice, when I came home very late, the roads were closed off by NYPD and we had to detour.  \r\n\r\nI am a good sleeper but I noticed that you can frequently hear loud ambulance or police car sirens throughout the night and loud music (I think there is a club nearby or one of the neighbours is loud) so I found that closing the bedroom door helps drown the sound out.  I slept with the windows open and did not use the air-cond (even though it was humid) as I like the natural air and found it very pleasant.  This is New York and I think that it is common to have constant sound of ambulance sirens.  \r\n\r\nPlease note that the apartment I rented is on the top floor of a brownstone so be aware if you have heavy luggage or back problems/walking problems.

We liked the neighbourhood, we found it safe even late at night. There are a few shops around as well as places to go for breakfast, dinner or drinks and Dana will give you some good addresses. It was well located, quick and easy to come from/go to the JFK airport. The closest subway is a 10min walk and the subway lines make it easy to go to Manhattan - about 20min for South Manhattan - which is not that long considering it's New York!

The information regarding local amenities and eateries they provided us with was invaluable. Shops are relatively close to the flat. A smaller grocery store is around the corner (about a 5 minute walk), a larger supermarket about a 15-minute walk away. Dana was also more than accommodating on the day we left, letting us leave our suitcases in her hallway before we checked out and left the city. The flat was exactly as described. It was comfortable, clean and had everything we needed. The photos don’t really do the rooms justice. The flat is private, tastefully decorated and all facilities are in perfect working order. The immediate neighbourhood felt safe and travelling to Manhattan was very simple via the subway system. It takes about 20-30 minutes via the express line (from Utica) to reach lower Manhattan. Obviously, as in any big city, some caution should be taken when travelling the subway system late at night. I would also suggest familiarising yourself with the various exits and entries to the subway stations prior to travel, if you are not used to the subway system.

A beautiful brownstone. Our apartment was on the top floor and felt very private. The place was spacious, bright, nicely decorated, and very clean! We had everything we needed and loved coming back to it each night to cook dinner and hang out. The area was exactly what we expected and with the help of Dana's tips, we knew the perfect breakfast and bakery spots to go to before heading to Manhattan. We were spending most of our days in Manhattan, coming back to this apartment at the end of the day, to hang out in at night and relax. And it was perfect, felt very homey in a quiet area. The proximity to the A/C subway line is perfect! The subway stop is on both the express and local A/C line, so coming and going to Manhattan and other areas of Brooklyn was very fast and easy! ! Loved the experience :) Dana was also extremely fast to answer any questions, and was so helpful with our check-in times! Great host!

I dreamed of staying in a Brooklyn brownstone for my first Brooklyn adventure and this place made my dreams come true. Walking distance to some cute places to eat and convenient shops. Definitely check out Tree House on Marcus Garvey St. The place was soooo clean! I slept like a baby on the full sized bed. I would stay here anytime! Seriously. The best!

It feels more that way than much of Manhattan.\n\nThe place is in the middle of the neighborhood, so it's a 7 minute or so walk from any of the three train stations, which is a bit far.  But those three stations offer five unique lines, so you can get to many places without transfers.  Certainly to the major stations in Manhattan. \n\nThe roommates are extremely nice and welcoming. We chatted a few times and they do their best to make the experience a pleasant one. They said I could use their dishes, eat their food, watch Netflix on their PS4, and all that. Very nice, and not really expected from strangers!\n\nThe room is small but just fine. The main problem was that it didn't have air conditioning. There's no AC in the apartment as a whole, and nor is there in the room. There's a fan, but that doesn't go very far when it's over 80 and the air source (an alley) doesn't get wind and tends to stay warm. AC would make this an excellent listing."}]}

The owner was very accommodating and provided all the information we needed in a timely manner. We liked the location because it was in more of a residential section, so, while still busy, it was out of the hustle and bustle of Soho and Midtown. The layout worked very well for our group of two couples and the bathroom was generously sized compared to some of the hotels we've stayed in near Times Square. We made use of the patio almost every night and it was such a nice feature to have. We've already recommended this apartment to several of our friends and we would definitely stay here again.

You","neighborhood_overview":"I lived in many neighbourhoods in Montreal and I believe this one is the most agreeable for its proximity with the St. Lawrence River and the Lachine Rapids (that you can ride with jet boating or rafting), the biking and running paths,  the parks nearby that make you forget that you are so close to the city, and the close distance to both downtown and the airport (we are basically midway between the airport and downtown). Wellington Street has many types of restaurants and cafés,","notes":"The apartment is fully equipped, including a washer-dryer that you can use to wash your clothes, a dish washer, and air-conditioning in the kitchen and the small bedroom.","transit":"The bus stop #58 is 200 meters away and from there it takes 9 minutes to get to subway station De L'Eglise on the green line, which takes you to downtown Montreal in 10 to 15 minutes, depending on which station you exit. Another option during summer is to rent a Bixi bike (the closest station is 200 meters away) and ride all the way to downtown, staying on reserved bike paths almost all the way. This will take you about 30-40 minutes, again depending on your destination. Or you can take the Bixi up to the subway station (about 13 minutes).","access":"You will have exclusive use of the entire apartment. We use an electronic lock so that you won't need to keep the apartment keys with you. At the time of reservation, please tell us which 4 digits of your choice you would like to use and I will program them in advance of your arrival.","interaction":"I live in the other apartment on the first floor and I am usually present during the evenings in case you need any help or information about the area.","house_rules":"This is a familial neighbourhood with young families living on each side of the apartment and so no noisy partying will be tolerated. PLEASE READ: Unfortunately, once in a while, I host a group which comes in late from a party and starts speaking loudly in the apartment, disturbing everyone around them. In that case, I will issue a single warning and then retain the security deposit if the group doesn't quiet down.

The kitchen has great quality pots \u0026 pans, a drip coffee maker and a Krups pump espresso machine for us caffeine addicts. The wall AC unit was great and will be very useful in the summer months.

There is a problem with the second bedroom window, which lacks an insect screen, a necessity particularly in summer. The 2 double bedrooms are fine, but the sofa/bed is not comfortable. Subject to these points being fixed, we recommend this."}]}

The only things to consider would be that it gets pretty warm in the apartment in the summer, Jerry provided fans and we were pretty comfortable. Also, the shower is a bit finicky. But those are easy concessions to be made when it's so convenient to the train, many groceries and restaurants, and you feel safe. \n\nLast but not least, Jerry is awesome!

We konden niet anders dan laat inchecken (vanwege het uur waarop we landen in JFK Airport). Hij maakte er geen enkel probleem van.

Zijn appartement bevindt zich dicht bij enkele metrostations (enorm handig om Manhattan te gaan verkennen) en is gelokaliseerd in een rustige en veilige buurt, voorzien van vele winkels, ontbijtzaken, etc. Je vindt er voor elk wat wils. Het appartement bevond zich in een oud gebouw met houten vloeren, wat wel zijn charmes had. Het was proper en voorzien van alles. Het enige minpuntje voor ons was dat we de verwarming niet konden regelen. Ze sloeg 's nachts plots aan en dan kon je niet meer goed slapen door de warmte (het was er verschrikkelijk warm).

The entire apartment is yours, including a private bathroom. There is a apple tv that includes Netflix so you have some entertainment. And most importantly, the apartment is very clean. My one minor take back is that the bedroom is connected to another apartments bedroom and is only divided by a single close door so, you can hear every single word and foot steps on the other side, and of course vice versa.

Smit was very understanding of my situation and did a great job to accommodate me. He was super responsive and everything went smoothly. If you book Smit's place you can be 100% sure that everything will go as planned. No fear of sudden cancelation or unpredictable surprises. That is huge since lots of Airbnb hosts tend to cancel on you without any explanation. Apartment is great, located in the middle of everything and Smit's room is quite spacious by NYC standards. Oh, and the best part of the apartment are Smith's roommates. They are smart, chill, respectable, thoughtful, worldly, and lots of fun. They really added a special touch to my NYC experience with their energy, music taste and stylish roof tops with gr8 cocktails. Two thumbs up for #44 Crew!

We would just walk the neighborhood and if something smelled good we'd stop for a meal in a local eatery, every meal we had was just great. Local fare and great drinks. Everywhere we went, the people were very nice and helpful, even when we couldn't speak the language very well. Barcelona is a great city with great people, even with the Independence vote going on. The general strike was kind of a pain, but we dealt with it. Very safe city as long as you didn't look like a pickpocket victim. We'd love to go back. Thanks again to our hosts.

The location is in a quiet, safe neighborhood with plenty of cafes and bakeries in walking distances. Ramon had his colleague arrange a Taxi service to come meet me at the airport.

This is such a wonderful touch by Ramon to make it a stress free arrival. The flat itself has all the modern conveniences and is tastefully decorated. I loved it! Note, you are not in the hustle and bustle of the city. This is the best part. You get a chance to live the the life of a Catalonian. Park Guell is about 15-20 minutes in walking distance... it took me 20 because it is up hill. Truly, you are 15 minutes away from all sites. The Taxi service is very convenient and at great prices. In the late afternoons, I would take a break and return to the flat, open up the balcony windows and just sit and relax. Such a comfortable place.

Only 5 minute walk to Carrer Blai which has tons of great choices. Apartment was clean and pretty spacious for Europe. Kitchen, dining and living area are quite roomy.  I think comfortably the max would be 4 adults in the apartment because of the bedrooms. 2 people in the main bedroom and 1 in each of the smaller rooms.  The smaller rooms do have a 2nd bed you can pull out but then you have no room to walk so it is a little tight, if it's kids then no problem, I think 6 adults would be a bit much. Beware of the shower, there is only a half glass so water shoots out all over the floor and there are no extra towels so that was a bit of a nuisance.  There was also a leak in the ceiling of the shared bathroom which they didn't have time to fix before we checked in but it only started leaking again on our last day. It looks like it has been an issue for some time with the stains on the ceiling. I have a feeling they have had a steady rotation of guests which is why they haven't properly fixed the issue.

I was given keys for a faulty lock and was locked out of the building the first night. The host fixed the issue the next day. But it was a stressful situation and ruined my first night in Barcelona. The house was not clean and we cleaned it. The host offered to bring a cleaner, but by that point we already bought supplies and cleaned the place up. The elevator wasn’t working, and he fixed that the next day which is great. \n\nThe place is great for sleeping. We visited in November (low season) and found it a quiet place.

The flat is quite cozy but if you're just using it as a small place to stay while you're exploring the city, it's perfect. There's a great little terrace that gets the morning sun, so if you're travelling in summer you can sip a coffee, or a sangrea, out there and take in the sounds of the city. One thing to note is that there's a second room which may mean that you're sharing the flat with others during your stay, but if you're up for meeting new people, again that shouldn't be too much of a problem. Also, if you're travelling in early spring like I did, the flat can get very cold. Darko gave me additional blankets and a storage heater so it was warmer, but just it's something to note. Either way, I would definitely recommend!"},{"_id":"244209059","date":{"$date":"2018-03-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6418336","reviewer_id":"160248008","reviewer_name":"Mikahlia","comments":"Darko is a super host!!

The apartment is nonetheless very quiet, and there is a small roof terrace. There is even a TV in the room. But this is a rather basic accommodation that may not be for everyone. It is an older building, and Darko's apartment is the attic, up more than one hundred stair steps, no elevator. The toilet doubles as the shower, and it is tiny, barely over a meter square. Showering with the handheld shower without constantly banging into something takes a bit of practice.

It was great getting to know them in our small short stay of 17 hours :D.\r\nThe place was ample for my husband and I but can accommodate a family of four or perhaps some a group of close friends. I like how Linda is making this very family friendly for those with very young ones by including a bassinet as a sleeping space.\r\nThe room was in construction while we were there, but well put together for our stay. It's obvious that all will be arranged perfectly in the end. Linda shared great \u0026 warm personal decorating ideas that should leave guests remembering her space. \r\nPops Diner was a great recommendation \u0026 walkable breakfast spot that features one of the Landivar's figurines - you gotta check it out! Plus the diner was great for food \u0026 prices. It shows that it's been an icon in the area. We trekked to the Queens Botanical Garden and ended that with a tea and dessert at Tous Les Jours - a must!!! Delicious \u0026 best croissants plus a moist sweet potato mousse cake - oh my! And I'm a sucker for Harney \u0026 Sons tea.\r\nA stroll back to Linda's for picking up luggage that they were SO graciously guarding while we enjoyed the day. I like the location, so close to Laguardia. PLUS we were kindly driven to \u0026 from airports for a lot less than taxis. The best!\r\nWe hope to keep in touch with this passionate kind couple for future stays.\r\n"},{"_id":"33480403","date":{"$date":"2015-05-28T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6422511","reviewer_id":"29409506","reviewer_name":"Horng Yi","comments":"Linda and her husband have been very helpful to me and my friends.

It is just shy of a 1 mile walk to the 7 train, which takes you into Manhattan. We were in town to go to a Mets game, and this place is particularly convenient for this sort of trip. There are plenty of yummy restaurant nearby, though be prepared for a pretty severe language barrier is you are an English speaker.\r\n\r\nThough we did enjoy our stay, there were a couple of hiccups here and there. Our door-code was inaccurate, which led to a 15 minute wait outside of the apartment. The apartment was also out of toilet paper. There is free parking on Linda's street, but we did get a ticket because of street-sweeping (there was a well-hidden sign that we missed). The internet was a bit slow. Finally, it was a bit unsettling that you could not lock your specific unit when you left it vacant. The door-code gives you access to a building with 3 of Linda's units, but your specific unit can only be locked when you are home as you are not given a key.\r\n\r\nRegardless of the above, I would stay again if I returned to Queens. The location may not be for everybody, but I loved it. Linda is a very attentive host, and appears to dedicate a great deal of effort to maintaining her properties."},{"_id":"38033872","date":{"$date":"2015-07-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6422511","reviewer_id":"10217527","reviewer_name":"William","comments":"the apartment was basic but clean and met all of our requirements"},{"_id":"38330898","date":{"$date":"2015-07-14T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6422511","reviewer_id":"5534905","reviewer_name":"Xiaomeng","comments":"This is my 10th time to NYC and 4th time stayed in Flushing, but very first time to do Airbnb.

We were there over the Christmas holiday and they left gingerbread cookies for us.  My son was welcome to play with their children and I spent time in their living space while they wrapped presents.  We stayed in both a room and the apartment and were very comfortable.  The home is a bit old and could use some repair (peeling paint) but everything works fine.  There is no door between the rooms in the apartment and parking is challenging after late afternoon.  \r\nI strongly recommend their home if you need a warm and friendly place. It's convenient to mass transit and there's free WiFi and Neflix (but no cable tv).  \r\nThere are two cats that are also friendly.  \r\nThey are really nice people and very responsive if you need something.

Robert picked us up from the airport. They were quite warm and helpful with regards travel information and the logistics to get to the different attractions. We rented 2 rooms with a private kitchen and bath. Their home is a good 45 minutes to Midtown (plus walk and bus ride of 10 minutes) and  another 25 minutes to Downtown. The location seems safe and the environment is family oriented. There's a laundromat a steps away and a bus stop as well. I would suggest though that the hosts would add outside locks in the rooms so as to ensure privacy. The toilet is quite small and the kitchen needs a bit of sprucing up. The rooms need more than a fresh coat of paint but the hosts' warm was made it worthwhile. We would definitely stay with them again in our next NYC trip."},{"_id":"74217387","date":{"$date":"2016-05-14T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6422511","reviewer_id":"69126004","reviewer_name":"Ken","comments":"The house is in the residential area but it also pretty close to the Flushing town and stores.

Linda/Robert will make you feel very welcome.\r\nFor a minimal fee, pick up and drop off at the airport is included and that is hard to beat.\r\nTh space was big and could easily fit more kids/people. Linda left a few children's toys that entertained my daughter well.  The beds are comfortable and neat. It is a space, especially, in NY that is hard to find especially if there is more than 2 in your company. \r\nThey are updating the space as much as they can and it will show some parts (toilet/bath) are a little outdated but it is more than functional and clean, most importantly. With items/choices that you can use, e.g.: shampoo/conditioner, lotion, etc. There were some occasional odd noises at night and we figured out it was from the heater. \r\nIt is a good walk to the subway station, maybe just 10 mins but would stretch to 15-20 due to heavy foot traffic. Then again, you could take the bus to make it quicker but we did not do that.\r\nThe convenience to food and restaurants is excellent! Food that is really good and cheap.\r\nIt is a safe, family friendly neighborhood  and a great place to stay after a day out in NY, and that was primarily the reason why we chose their home.

First off she's an amazing host and went out of her way to provide amenities to us like baby swing, high chair etc. She was extremely communicative and responded within minutes to questions, and check in was super smooth.\n\nThe apartment itself was perfect for our needs with a bunk bed and main bed. Everything was pleasantly set up, with slippers, towels, and linens all provided! \n\nWhen entering, the living room/bunk bed room is connected to the bedroom, which is then connected to the kitchen with the bathroom off to the side. One thing to note if privacy is an issue is that all the rooms are connected without doors in between (except bathroom of course), just to be aware~! It wasn't an issue for us but if someone wanted to watch TV and others wanted to sleep it may be difficult.\n\nWe had a great stay at Linda's apartment and would love to stay again!

Linda goes above and beyond-more than just offering a place to stay, she enables you to have the smoothest visit possible and offers a lot of great extras like parking and pickup options and really goes out of her way to make sure you have what you need. Clear, fast communication and a friendly and efficient host. So for anyone traveling to the city, this is a great Airbnb. \n\nBut it’s particularly ideal if you are traveling with young kids. Linda and her family have set up the space to be comfortable for everyone in the family-lots of places to sleep, toys and essentials like packnplay, high chair, potty seats are available as well as thoughtful touches like childproofed furniture and device charging stations, removable soft floor surface for crawling babies and toddlers, etc. We were traveling with a 7 month old and the homey aspects of Linda’s place and her helpfulness in so many ways really made a trip that could have been very stressful much more smooth. What a lovely individual she is-we felt like friends rather than customers! \n\nI also loved the area-although some have mentioned noisy streets, this was actually rather quiet for a city neighborhood and the apartment itself was very quiet inside-we had no trouble with street noise at night. The area is very safe and on the many pleasant walks we took we felt like it was almost like being in a dozen countries at once with all the different cultures represented in businesses, restaurants and places of worship and the families we interacted with in the parks and common spaces. \n\nAs far as getting into the city, I had business in Manhattan every day of our stay and found the commute very straightforward and easy-this line of the subway is easy to figure out and pretty fast since you don’t need transfers-a 30 minute subway ride after the 12 minute walk to the subway.\n\nAll in all a fantastic experience and we will definitely stay here again if/when we’re back in the area again!"},{"_id":"300236025","date":{"$date":"2018-08-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6422511","reviewer_id":"6924436","reviewer_name":"Kristel","comments":"Linda's place was really nice and cosy. it's a really nice place if you want to stay for a couple of nights in New York.

The space is perfect for having kids with a bunkbed, play space \u0026 bathtub. Linda also provided a highchair, nursing pillow, stroller, and pack n play for us to care for our newborn son in an unfamiliar space. On top of that, our toddler got sick while we were there and she even lent us some cold medicine. Every little thing that we could need was provided and they were just so kind and hospitable. The icing on the cake was the ability to pay for airport transport. Robert picked us up and dropped us off at the airport for an extra fee so we could avoid navigating public transit with 2 kids and 8 bags.

This was our first airbnb experience so I was a little nervous but the apt was exactly as described and Demi was a really great host. She answered all my questions and even let us go into the apt early due to a redeye flight. The place was very comfortable and looks just like the pictures. She has a great eye for decorating. You have the entire top floor so with the windows open, it's a really nice breeze throughout the apartment on warm days. Everything is provided that you may need. Nice kitchen but we didn't use it due to all the great restaurants in the area. The apt is walking distance to Prospect Park which has a fun farmers market on Saturdays, many great restaurants, cafes and bars. It is also an easy walk to a few metro stations and the Brooklyn Museum.

The apartment is located in the second floor and was really clean and decorated as the pictures on airbnb displays it. Whenever we had a question or needed a safe bet, we could address oneself to demi. It was our first time booking an apartment at airbnb- but now we wouldn´t choose another way. It really enriched our time in New York and was the right decision. Betting is that we will come back- so we highly recommend demi´s place for a stay in New York.

Knowing the neighbourhood from previous visits (having family living just around the corner from Prospect Place), we felt at home at once. The appartment added certainly to the feeling: beautifuly and colorfully furnished (remnants of the shop Demi once had), wooden floors, comfortable beds and sofa, huge trees on both sides, looking out on a tree-lined street on one side, a big garden at the other side, completely equipped with everything you could need (even a well stocked fridge and cupboard with - fresh - leftovers from former guests), toiletries, etc. etc. And it was spotless on top. It was nice talking to Demi, who leaves her guests at ease. But she is there when you need her and is always helpful. I would certainly recommend the apartment (and neighbourhood) from which you easily can reach Manhattan but also Coney Island. Our suggestions: our longtime favorite is Tom's diner, just around the corner, serving hefty breakfasts and lunches. Unfortunately we didn't visit the botanical garden in Prospect Park, we've heard it's a beautiful place. But we did make a bicycle tour, crossing Manhattan-bridge coming from Brooklyn, following the bicycle-path along the Hudson to the north, very nice."},{"_id":"12925273","date":{"$date":"2014-05-14T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"643328","reviewer_id":"9640784","reviewer_name":"Chris","comments":"We loved Demi's beautiful apartment.

I chose it primarily because I appreciated the style and decor, an important thing I consider (along with value) when choosing a place to stay. The apartment delivered on all accounts. It is a top floor apartment, with a walk up a couple flights of steep winding stairs. We arrived amidst a heatwave, and Demi was kind enough to install an air conditioning unit in the bedroom which was most welcomed. The weather cooled the next day and it was barely needed at all. \n\nTo be clear, this apartment lies in Prospect Heights, a vibrant and diverse neighborhood that lies just north of Prospect Park. It's about a 10-15 min walk to the Brooklyn Museum stop, and a fairly short subway ride to Manhattan from there. The neighborhood is still one in transition, something that does not bother me, but don't expect Park Slope or the West Village. It's still a bit rough around the edges, but I didn't feel unsafe with my daughter at all. We enjoyed the Brooklyn museum and Botanic gardens being so close as well as the quick subway ride to Coney Island. There are myriad great dining options within walking distance along with a couple bodegas that are open late. \n\nThe lone downside was the deafeningly loud block party our last night, though that was far out of the control of our host. \n\nI would gladly recommend Demi's apartment to anyone who wants to truly experience the best Brooklyn has to offer.

We were able to spend a lot of time exploring Brooklyn and felt like we got to experience a different side of the typical touristy NYC trip. At the same time, the subway stop was only about half a mile away so we could easily get to Manhattan if we chose (though it takes a little while). The apt was furnished beautifully and was comfortable and spacious. Demi even provided some fantastic homemade granola that I wish I could have taken back on the plane with me!

There are also great bars, deli, pharmacy, liquor stores etc, and restaurants in adjoining and parallel streets, that make a lazy night out close to home easy, and this is welcome after beating the feet all day. The two flights of stairs are worth the effort as once the bags are up there, you have light and space, a very decent kitchen and a comfortable bed in a large airy bedroom. The shower has great pressure and the added bonus of the bath was great. I have stayed in fabulous Airbnb apartments in Barcelona and Paris, and now New York is added to the list of wonderful homes away from home.

We had a heat wave (upwards of 95 degrees) during my stay which was a bit challenging, but the a/c unit kept the bedroom very comfortable. Very walkable to markets, restaurants, shops, Prospect Park and the Brooklyn Museum. 40 minutes door to door to Museum Mile on Manhattan's upper east side.

Help was at hand, but everything was so well set up and accommodating in the apartment that we needed no further assistance during our 5-day stay.

The two main rooms are relatively spacious. The bed was comfortable. Great kitchen facilities - mainly used for breakfast with Demi's Granola. We found some  days and nights quite warm and very humid - so the two air conditioners were much appreciated.\nThere are plenty of public transport options to Manhattan, and lots do do closer to home ( \"in the neighbourhood\") too. Try Prospect Park, Botanic Gardens, Brooklyn Museum and Library, even a swim at Brighton Beach - if you have already seen the tourist sites and want to wind down a little.\nDemi is a warm host, who likes to keep a fairly low profile, but is very responsive to txt or email throughout the stay.\nWe would not hesitate to return and are happy to recommend."},{"_id":"287797041","date":{"$date":"2018-07-08T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"643328","reviewer_id":"7054828","reviewer_name":"Katherine","comments":"Great central spot to a lot of storefronts, bars \u0026 restaurants on Franklin Street in Crown Heights and Prospect Heights.

Also, we were asked to turn off our AC one night and the street can get quite loud after dark (even all the way up on the third floor).\nI definitely recommend staying with Demi - it's a beautiful neighborhood and there's so much to do.

And it offered us a quick trip to Coney Island for the Friday fireworks. A perfect location for those that want to escape the hustle and bustle of Manhattan. \nDemi was/is a great host. She was very accommodating to our travel needs and even met us with a great smile once we arrived many hours late (flight delays). She gave us our space during our stay but was very quick to respond to any messages I sent. She provides many guidebooks for the city and even suggested many great restaurants in the local area. It was so helpful to us outsiders. \nAs for her place, it was clean, bright, spacious, and quiet. Not much noise from the outside life so we could easily sleep at night. She has all the requirements for dining in with many quality markets close by. Again, a central location. My wife and I even had the chance to run around Prospect Park, which has a great local market on Saturdays. \nWe can’t express enough how great our stay was.

Their pride and love for Montreal is expressed elegantly in every corner of their home. They truly make every accommodation possible and enjoyable  with impeccable taste and exceptional attention to detail. The room and bed are extremely comfortable and the closet space generous. Their spacious apartment is conveniently located near any available mode of transportation in the city within a city block's distance. It's prime  location in \"le plateau\" places you at the heart of one of the most exciting neighborhoods in the entire city with  restaurants, cafes and entertainment all around where you can enjoy delicious food, beer and great live music.

Trata-se de um apartamento muito bem localizado que está a aproximadamente 500 metros da Sagrada Família. Em frente ao prédio há uma parada de ônibus sendo possível se locomover facilmente para os principais pontos de interesse da cidade. Existem 3 estações de metro que estão a aproximadamente 500m do apartamento.  O apartamento é muito agradável, possui uma reforma recente e está bem decorado e equipado com todos utensílio necessários para uma temporada.

It was clean and fully prepared for my arrival. It was great to be able to use the roof terrace a few times in late summer, with its view of the Sagrada Familia. Check in and check out were smooth with no problems.  As a landlord Sascha was personable, friendly and professional, responding promptly and fully to any queries. He also had left out some guide books to help me explore the city, as well as clear instructions for the operation of any appliances, where necessary.

You have plenty of supermarkets and restaurants nearby, and also metro and bus stops.\n\nSascha was a great host, always fast to answer to any questions I had, and he even was nice enough to upgrade the Internet to a faster one when I asked (I work from home).\n\nThe only things I would improve would be changing the TV for a newer and bigger one, and adding some extra light to the living room, which can be a little dark at times. Also, the apartment is at the 5th floor, and there is no elevator. But these are all small things.\n\nI would rent the apartment again for sure. Recommended!"}]}

There's a helper who is very kind and friendly, which also made us feel comfortable.\r\nThe house was clean and lovely. It has a beautiful garden, fully equipped kitchen and spacious roof top overlooking great view. Our kids loved playing with the dog and cats in the rooms. We felt as if we had come to another country leaving busy, hectic life in a city of Hong Kong.\r\nThe house is located in a remote place, so make sure you know where to get off a cab coz we got totally lost after dinner!\r\nWe got off a cab on an ally next to the right one, but it's really hard to find out the house during night. Anyway, the helper came to find us so we finally arrived at home. Eventually, it made funny memory for us;)\r\nThank you very much!!

Some have argued that it wasn't easy to reach and a bit too far out. But this argument proves illogical while they are comparing to anything else more urban - hence this be called a 'getaway'. However I find this to be a perfect solution to be out in the mountains surrounded by the full force of green vegetation all the while only a five minute taxi ride into Sai Kung town for all your amenities, enough choices for eating out and a convenient terminus to head into the city about an hour away. What more can you ask for?\r\n\r\nThe British family hosts are friendly and generous. Although I've always seen B\u0026B's to mean 'bed and breakfast', this accommodation is more like a 'B', since breakfast was, as clearly defined on the site, not included. However their kitchen is free to use and one only needs to bring their own groceries up to the house to cover the stay. Rooftop BBQ was a promised highlight but the grill was so rusted out from under-use that my planned steak BBQ turned to a stove-top fry down in the kitchen instead.\r\n\r\nOverall I still highly recommend this stay to anyone who wishes to find a nice quiet stay to gaze out in late afternoon/evenings under the stars on the rooftop or just to hunker down for a few days watching countless DVDs available or to hike on the plethora of trails that lead out and around the surrounding mountain sides. Whatever you end up doing, you'll come out fully rested and ready for another round from Hong Kong city's knockout attack on your whole being.

It was our first Airbnb experience so we were not sure what to expect.  Philippe was great to deal with.  He always responded quickly and even though French is his first language we had no problems communicating in English.\nThis apartment is about a 10 minute walk from two metro stations (Pie IX and Joliette) and if you have luggage you can take a bus to/from the metro station (the metro is down the hill from this house), the bus stop is right around the corner from the house.  When we arrived Philippe greeted us with the keys and gave us a tour of the apartment.  He thoughtfully had a small snack on the table for us and showed us lots of things he set aside  to help us out on our trip such as maps of the city and a booklet with information to help us find grocery stores, malls, etc.  \nThe apartment was cosy with lots of  things to make us feel welcome.  The kitchen was well equipped, although we mostly ate out enjoying the great food in Montreal.  There is lots of room in the fridge and appliances to make meals or reheat leftovers.  The bathroom was very clean and modern.  There is a nice sized storage area to keep empty suitcases and bags.  Everywhere we looked in the apartment we found things set out to make our stay a good one - there was a candy jar, coffee, tea, jams, bread in the freezer, a first aid kit, sewing kit and a laundry room.  There was even local art on the walls and lots of decorations around the place to make us feel at home.\nI have nothing to compare this experience to other than hotel stays but both my wife and I were very impressed with both Philippe and Marie and the apartment.  If we are ever back in Montreal I will be sure to check the availability of La maison aux raisins."},{"_id":"287038624","date":{"$date":"2018-07-07T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6457918","reviewer_id":"6428177","reviewer_name":"Manuel","comments":"Excellent séjour, comme à chaque fois!"},{"_id":"295460311","date":{"$date":"2018-07-23T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6457918","reviewer_id":"64640802","reviewer_name":"Jessica","comments":"Super appartement ! en demi sous sol donc éclairé mais quand même frais, très propre et bien équipé. dès notre arrivée nous avons très bien été reçu par Philippe qui avait laisser des muffins pour nous dans la cuisine.

We found Philippe's place to be a wonderful value for the money and it was a very comfortable apartment. It's a basement level unit with Philippe living right upstairs so the host is always conveniently nearby. We found that he responded to messages quickly.  We met him during check-in when he showed the apartment to us and pointed out where we can find items we may need.  He gave us the keys, showed us how to lock the doors and walked us through how to park. He was very pleasant. There were many thoughtful items left for us: a couple muffins for breakfast, water, juice and beer in the fridge, plenty of tea in the cupboard. The kitchen was well stocked with pots and pans, a variety of dishes, etc. The mattress was firm and while I like a softer mattress (my husband prefers one that is firm!) I found that I woke up well rested and comfortable.\n\nWe found the location of the apartment to be absolutely wonderful.  It was a short walk (about 5 mins) to the Biodome, Botanical Gardens and Pie IX metro station. The apartment is located on a wonderfully quiet residential street and we felt very safe leaving our car parked on the street. Near the apartment is a grocery store as well as 3 local parks that were beautiful to walk through. We couldn't have been happier with the location of this space.

The apartment was beautiful, apparently new, and well-equipped, on a quiet street. Philippe went far beyond what we could have expected in helping us. When we were having trouble finding our way from the airport, he came and picked us up at the Metro. He was available every time we needed any help planning what we would do in Montreal. \n\nThe most fascinating place we visited turned out to be the botanical garden, unlike any we’ve seen anywhere else, and the big chain of greenhouses with plants from around the world and information about them. They are a short walk from Philippe’s house, as is the Metro. There's a bus to a different Metro station that stops even closer to his house but we didn't use it.\n\nAltogether, Montreal was a great vacation for us. The only downside was flight delays in both directions, to and from Boston. We could have gotten there much faster and easier by car, which is how we will go if we have a chance for a second trip."},{"_id":"334228407","date":{"$date":"2018-10-08T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6457918","reviewer_id":"110880662","reviewer_name":"Kelley","comments":"This was our third trip to Montreal since our son and daughter-in-law got married, and Philippe'S home will be our go to from now on.

It is super super clean and it is decorated very nicely.   While parking didn't come with it there is parking always available right under the expressway across the street.  There is a great little bar in the base of the building where they serve lovely cocktails and no need to worry about any noise coming from there either. Only noise I could hear was typical of a city.

Super comfortable bed and pillows, perfect end to a busy day!\r\n\r\nIt is right by a busy intersection so you do get traffic noise, however, it was not much more than my stay at the Renaissance hotel in midtown. I think that's just the norm for that area and it did not interrupt my sleep one bit. \r\n\r\nAbout the area: Beaner Bar OMG!! It's a short walk just south of the apartment and the Mexican Hot Chocolate or Mocha is just bliss! About a 5-7 minute walk you can enjoy Lella Alimentari an Italian Cafe that really sets the ambiance and you feel like you are in Italy! I just loved that these gems are so close to Franky's apartment and there are so many more to discover. \r\n\r\nIf I find myself vacationing in NYC again, I will be looking Franky up again.

Just felt bad because she was late and yet she did not want to spend anything, not even a penny for a call or text (:p), to make it better for her waiting guests or offer any apology. Place is good but the waiting and stress and inconsiderateness of the host is a turn off. \r\nAlso the neighbors' kid cries 24/7 and you can hear their voices thru the wall especially when you are on the bed. \r\nLocation and design are great but the host really ruined it all.

Ended up waiting to get into the room for 2 hrs only to be told it is not even ready and that I had to wait another 1-2 hrs for the room to be cleaned. I initially wanted to check in at 3pm which is past the designated time to begin with, I would have assumed that the room was at least cleaned. When I finally got into the room, it was as described but there was no wifi. The host arranged for the provider to fix the issue but I was left without wifi for 4 days out of the 6 I was staying. I think if you just need a room to sleep in then this would be fine but I don't think I will be staying again after my horrible experience.

Carolina is a fantastic host, very accommodating and her responses are always prompt and helpful (replies within mins). The location is tremendous - surrounded by plenty of eateries (low to higher end), short walk to Victoria Harbour for the amazing view, airport express shuttle bus, 24 hours supermarkets, shopping malls and laundries literally just downstairs, 5 mins walk to TST MTR Station, also short walk to TST East and Jordan stations, also the new West Kowloon Station for high speed trains to China, walkable to the Macau ferry terminal if you fancy taking a day trip there like we did. Most importantly the apartment is super clean, very cozy, feels just like home and you can see how she cares for her guests by the attention to details - very well equipped for a long stay, flat is relatively spacious in HK standards. The Wifi connection is reliable \u0026 fast. Lastly, she is very helpful, kind and enthusiastic, check-in was a breeze. Overall, every aspect of my stay was positive and I would definitely recommend her place to anyone! Thank you for the awesome experience!"}]}

Hernan is very neat and organised, so that added to the comfort level.\r\n\r\nThe Bedroom :  Has a queen-sized bed, bedside table, small wardrobe, chest of drawers, writing desk.   More than adequate for a single traveller, though room size may be a little compact for two pax ... but there's always the living room and balcony area to chill in.\r\n\r\nTransportation :  Not a problem because I had a car.   Public transport within walking distance.   Even if it is not smack in the city area, I have always encouraged travellers to experience the beautiful suburbs of Sydney.  Time permitting, travelling by bus (as opposed to trains) will allow you to see a lot more.\r\n\r\nSurrounds :   Nice restaurants/eateries and a couple of large supermarkets are all within easy walking distance.   I managed to stock up on some groceries and had a few meals at \"home\".   The lovely beach is just a few minutes' walk away.   I would encourage guests who drive to explore other beaches and nooks to get a good feel of the district.\r\n\r\nThank you, Hernan, for your warm hospitality and being such a gracious and kind host.   I definitely recommend a stay at this apartment.

That said, the bus stop is a short walk away from the house, and I took it several times to the train station and directly into the city.

When my plans fell through, I needed a place to stay in a hurry before leaving super early for the airport. Hernan's place was a 15min taxi ride away and he gave me the number of a local firm. Air bnb's app was causing some issues and Hernan was so patient and kind with my many messages and took the time to really help me. I was sorry I didn't get to meet him personally to thank him, but I really appreciated all he went through to help me book the room. The bed was so comfortable and the room was super spacious and clean. Hernan's place was easy to get to by bus or train, next time I'd love to stay longer, its right next to a beach!

Although only for two nights and due to Australia Day we didn't interact very much, he was very kind and helpful with directions and public transport. He makes you feel at home very quickly. His apartment is very clean and tidy and situated in a great area. Just walk out the street to the beach, lots of shops and places to eat and drink, very close to the airport. At the beach you can see the planes arrive and depart and ships sail into Botany Bay. The only thing one should consider is that his apartment is on the second floor, no elevator, so if you are not travelling light, then you need to be fit.\r\nI had a great stay and hope to chat a bit more next time.

For example.. for me the \"main entrance\" means the entrance facing the street.. Difference of culture? I didn't notice also while bookingthat I'll have 2 floors to climb with my luggage, late night..But Hernan even he wasn't here, helped me a lot by phone, he is a really good host and his flat is simple but very cosy. The price is very good as well. I write this comment from an other AIR BNB host close to the airport like Hernan's home, but I regret to have booked this one (done before Hernan, couldn't cancel).

It's located in heart of the city but the rooftop location means you can relax in perfect peace and quiet before experiencing the best of what the cuty has to  offer.","neighborhood_overview":"","notes":"","transit":"","access":"","interaction":"","house_rules":"","property_type":"Apartment","room_type":"Private room","bed_type":"Real Bed","minimum_nights":"3","maximum_nights":"8","cancellation_policy":"strict_14_with_grace_period","last_scraped":{"$date":"2019-03-08T05:00:00.000Z"},"calendar_last_scraped":{"$date":"2019-03-08T05:00:00.000Z"},"first_review":{"$date":"2016-08-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"last_review":{"$date":"2016-08-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"accommodates":2,"bedrooms":1,"beds":1,"number_of_reviews":2,"bathrooms":{"$numberDecimal":"1.0"},"amenities":["TV","Internet","Wifi","Air conditioning","Kitchen","Smoking allowed","Buzzer/wireless intercom","Heating","Family/kid friendly","Washer","Dryer","Smoke detector","Essentials","Shampoo","24-hour check-in","Hangers","Hair dryer","Iron","Laptop friendly workspace","translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_50"],"price":{"$numberDecimal":"45.00"},"security_deposit":{"$numberDecimal":"250.00"},"cleaning_fee":{"$numberDecimal":"25.00"},"extra_people":{"$numberDecimal":"0.00"},"guests_included":{"$numberDecimal":"1"},"images":{"thumbnail_url":"","medium_url":"","picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/e13dbda9-f55f-410a-8d4e-966526de1564.jpg?aki_policy=large","xl_picture_url":""},"host":{"host_id":"6036222","host_url":"https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/6036222","host_name":"Skd","host_location":"London, England, United Kingdom","host_about":"fhlfhaslfhalkfh","host_thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/ff6b2711-cb0e-4d1e-880d-79028d502ad5.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","host_picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/ff6b2711-cb0e-4d1e-880d-79028d502ad5.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","host_neighbourhood":"","host_is_superhost":false,"host_has_profile_pic":true,"host_identity_verified":false,"host_listings_count":1,"host_total_listings_count":1,"host_verifications":["email","phone","reviews"]},"address":{"street":"Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain","suburb":"Ciutat Vella","government_area":"Sant Pere, Santa Caterina i la Ribera","market":"Barcelona","country":"Spain","country_code":"ES","location":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[2.17781,41.38502],"is_location_exact":false}},"availability":{"availability_30":0,"availability_60":0,"availability_90":0,"availability_365":0},"review_scores":{"review_scores_accuracy":10,"review_scores_cleanliness":6,"review_scores_checkin":10,"review_scores_communication":10,"review_scores_location":10,"review_scores_value":7,"review_scores_rating":80},"reviews":[{"_id":"91445832","date":{"$date":"2016-08-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6530907","reviewer_id":"25587287","reviewer_name":"Bart","comments":"We had a great stay at the apartment of Jonathan.

First off, Karina and David themselves were wonderful. They are respectful and helpful, kind and understanding. I felt like we (my partner and I) were staying with friends the whole month. By the time we left Barcelona, we both felt equally as sad leaving Karina and David. \n   It is important to note, first, that the bed in their room is the most comfortable bed (and pillow) I have ever slept on! I have been searching, to no avail, for a pillow like theirs since I left. Also, there is a desk space in the room, which is not always the case in many airbnbs. I appreciated this as I was doing a bit of work from Barcelona for the month. There is also a chest of drawers and clothes bureau which has ample space for both a single occupant or couple. My partner and I fit all of our things in there no problem – and we stayed for a month.\n   Also, Karina and David keep their house very clean and tidy which makes for a very comfortable stay. And they helped us with things we needed around the house at any time. They were also available via text or phone at any time if we had a question when they weren’t home. We never were left needing something for long. \n   Equally as important, they live extremely close to many metro stops. One was just a short stroll down the street. Very convenient for getting around Barcelona!\n   But I have now written too much without mentioning their two beautiful kitties Sofia and Mimi. Mimi is lazy and calm and will, at most, curl up behind your head on the couch. Otherwise, she likes to spend her time sleeping on cool surfaces or on the porch (which is also a wonderful space in the house!) Young Sofia will steal your heart too. She loves bothering Mimi and playing in the porch flowers. I still ask Karina to send me pictures of them so I stop myself from going out and adopting two cats just like them!\n\n   In sum, we have left Barcelona with more than touristy memories and Sagrada Familia souvenirs. Thanks to Karina and David, we felt we experienced the real Barcelona because we experienced the thing that makes the city so great – the people that live there. \n\nThank you both for everything :) we will back!"}]}

And if you are new to Montreál, you will not find a greater introduction to really living like a local while still having all the tourist areas so close at hand.

We stayed in Richard's stylish and cozy apartment for a week in early July, and have nothing but praise. The location in Plateau Mont-Royal is great. In a quiet street with two-story buildings, close to a nice park in a vibrant and great neighbourhood. Downtown is only a 30 minute walk away. With Plateau and Parc Mont-Royal within walking distance in the other direction. And a metro stop close by if you need to go further - or if you don't want to walk. Richard was very helpful with advice and tips, and made us feel very welcome. We travelled as a family of four, with two boys in their teens. The apartment worked out very good for us. On an evening with unexpected rain, we had no problem retreating to the apartment to relax there. Plateau was without doubt the right district to stay on our first visit to Montréal. Relaxed, informal and easygoing. Full of charm and character. Picturesque buildings, good restaurants, and an area where we felt totally safe. If this is what you're looking for, we're pretty sure you will be just as satisfied as we were with this apartment."},{"_id":"85814161","date":{"$date":"2016-07-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6589965","reviewer_id":"52763126","reviewer_name":"Michael","comments":"The host canceled this reservation 23 days before arrival.

The kitchen had everything we needed (except a teapot!). The bathroom is a good size. There was lots of space everywhere in the house so we weren't tripping over each other. It was great to have a private outdoor space. Everything is on the ground floor, so there were no flights of stairs to climb. We very much enjoyed our experience in our first stay in an AirBnB.

I could live there. And we chose a fantastic place. Upon our arrival the room wasn't quite yet ready, so Mariana's mother took us, by car, on a tour around the city. It was fantastic, as we were able to see more than we would have been able to cover on foot in two days. The apartment itself was lovely: simple, clean, and decorated with Mariana's own beautiful artwork. There is no kitchen, but M\u0026J provided some fruit and water, and it's a five minute walk to cafés and restaurants. The apartment is above their gallery and located in a wonderful artistic district. We spent one wonderful day in particular exploring the old city, walking the bridge, riding cable cars, and tasting port across the river. We also ate a fantastic dinner at a restaurant called Portugalia (on the beach, near where the river meets the sea). M\u0026J were very attentive, helpful, and friendly.

The location is a convenient base, from which to see the city, plenty of bars, cafe, restaurants etc close by to suit your needs. You can understand why travellers vote Porto one of the top cities to visit in the world. The San bento main train station was only a 10 minutes walk, Ribeiro around 20 minutes, the Carolina Michaelis metro 20 minutes, with heavy luggage. Sad to see the gravity of the graffiti vandalism in Porto in general, particularly, in the  old city, historical sites included, the   bone fide artists colony around Bombarda street was also not spared.\n"},{"_id":"55632816","date":{"$date":"2015-12-03T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6601944","reviewer_id":"21998027","reviewer_name":"Peter","comments":"Mariana \u0026 Joäo are a lovely hosts, who are always looking to improve the experience of their guests at the gallery.

It doesn't take long to see why the  city of Porto is rated in the top few of the most liked places to visit in the world. A negative feature in Porto, is the sight of graffiti vandalism particularly in the old city,  on historical places of importance especially. It is an eye sore, and, sad to see. Even the area around the bone-fide artists colony, hasn't escaped this problem. \r\nThe \"Gallery\" has it all to make your stay an enjoyable one.

Communication with Mariana was smooth throughout and even though, unfortunately, we didnt meet her until we were leaving because she was on holiday herself, she was constantly responsive to my messages and made sure that that the apartment was ready for us and somewhere was there to meet us to hand over the keys. Initially, i was going to ask for her Porto tips of where to visit and eat but we had fun working it out ourselves and there was a TimeOut guide to Porto in the apartment which was our valuable companion for our 3/4 day stay. \r\n\r\nAs everyone has pointed out, this is in a great area, in a groovy street of galleries,  really lovely cafes and a restaurants a fabulous tea house across the road and some really interesting shops. Also we walked everywhere from here, only caught the tram once to go Foz and the bus back to the airport. \r\n\r\nThe apartment has the most lovely feel with its solid walls, sense of history and original creative style. Its a perfect city apartment, uncluttered but still put together with flair and love. The basic food preparing facilities are just enough for this kind of trip and staying here for myself and my 11 year old son was really great fun. It is exactly as it says but the experience itself, in this apartment, in this street in this wonderful, old, vibrant and inspiring city was more of a delight than we had anticipated. If you err to the more creative and bohemian, you will really love this place!

The location is above a gallery/exhibition space in the art district in Porto. I found the location to be handy enough and was able to walk to all the areas I wanted to visit. The Port houses were only a 20 minute walk away and the famous book shop is about 7 mins. The street is covered with excellent, tasteful and thought provoking street art which made wandering around even more enjoyable. \n\nMariana was incredibly helpful and even took the time to sit down with me for 20 minutes recommending local restaurants, bars, and things to see by marking them on a map. This was such a nice touch and I really appreciated her going out of her way to do it, especially as she was in the middle of setting up for an exhibition that began the following day. \n\nThe space itself is perfectly adequate, the bed is comfortable and the shower is powerful. Noise levels weren't a problem as the street is perfectly quiet. I would however describe it as more of an ensuite room than an entire apartment, as it is quite small and there's no separate kitchen facility. This was not a problem as there are lovely coffee shops and a really nice breakfast spot further down the street. 2 breakfasts with coffee for less than €10!! \n\nAll in all I would happily stay there again. The location and the hosting was unbeatable.

As we were with kids and a grandma the flat was not spacious enough for us, though we asked. The 2nd bed is in a walk through room between 1st bed (which leads to the toilett) and exit. Also garden use is only possible when the host is in the gallery. Still, the flat is nice and fine decorated and you can find plenty of opportunities to eat or drink or watch close around. The host knows the area pretty well and has pretty good recommondations. As it happend, a board of a table came down when we put a daily bag on it and we somehow stained a towel (which somehow stained another towel) with coffee. so, of course, we had to compensate the host. so, at the end, we paid pretty much for a medium experience. but, as it goes, not really to blame the flat or the host.

Having a parking space in Waikiki is also incredibly convenient, as is the Skytower's location near beaches and amenities (but it's on a small side street, so you miss out on a lot of the noise).

It has a homey feel to it. The view was fantastic, as it was on the 25th floor. The kitchen and laundry/dryer was very useful. The building was very secure, as a transponder is required to open the garage door, the building entrance, and to use the elevator. The parking stall was easy to get in and out. The location was great. Five minute walk to the beach. The apartment building was only a few hundred feet from Kuhio Ave, yet it was very accessible by car, as it is situated on a secluded street.

Even as a first time traveller the accommodation selection process can be a little daunting and is often handled by a travel agent. \nBUT........If you are looking to travel to Hawaii at any time and for any reason I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this apartment at Waikiki Sky Tower!\nFrom the initial booking stage to arriving in Hawaii, Tiare was extremely helpful every step of the way. Tiare was very easy to communicate with and has a passion for the area as well as ensuring our stay at the apartment was stress free! As we arrived  on a mid morning flight, Tiare met us at the apartment early and provided access to be able to store our luggage - no stress!\nThis apartment is situated in the absolute heart of Waikiki, with everything at your doorstep. The apartment is in a quiet street only one block from the beach - and the view from the 25th floor is sensational. \n One (of many) standouts for choosing this apartment was its security. Access to the building requires a security fob, as well as access to the lift and car park. (We hired a car during our stay and the ability to park the car for free, in a secure parking area within the building was FANTASTIC.)\nThis apartment has everything you need for a 'self sufficient' type of holiday that no motel 'room' can provide. The apartment is has every appliance and utensil  from a washer dryer, to the coffee pot and the knives and forks to the air conditioner you won't be found wanting anything!!\nThe location of this apartment is another of it's many benefits. With only a few steps from the building you can catch any one of the many 'trolley' transports, find a supermarket, dine at any number of restaurants, shop at so many diverse locations (retail / markets / boutique) and of course access Waikiki beach - it is all right there!!\n\nWe loved our stay in this apartment and can't recommend it highly enough - thanks Tiare!!\n\n"},{"_id":"10796013","date":{"$date":"2014-03-08T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"660316","reviewer_id":"477399","reviewer_name":"Birtu","comments":"I and my husband stayed five days during our Hawaiian vacation first week of March. We had a fabulous time in Oahu thanks to Tiare's fantastic apartment and her incredible kindness. She allowed us to check in directly when we arrived and we were able to check out later than we needed to because her next guests  were not arriving until a day later. I mention this because this meant she would have less time to get the apartment ready for the next people but she took that inconvenience upon herself to accommodate us and make our stay wonderful. Her apartment location can't be beat. It is in the heart of Waikiki, only half a block from buses, 3 short blocks from the beach, incredible balcony overlooking the ocean and the city which we enjoyed very much during breakfast and some evenings we decided to stay in. Within the apartment, the bed was very comfortable, the bed sheets so soft, and the kitchen stocked with all the cookware we needed, and more channels than we cared to watch on the TV, and overall very clean. The other huge plus was the free parking. We rented a car the last two days of our stay so that we could drive around the island and explore more of the city, and her parking spot came in handy. Overall, we LOVED staying in her apartment and if we ever return to Oahu, we will definitely contact her if her place is available and if its, we will see no need to check elsewhere.  Thanks, Tiare!

The location was absolutely perfect; in a quiet side street but less than a 10 minute walk to the beach. There were also plenty of basic food stores, shops and restaurants in the area.

It was everything and more than we expected.  Tiara is an absolute joy to work with.  Upon our arrival the unit was clean, well stocked with lots of ammenities your typical hotel would not have had, and the best part was the free parking.  \r\n\r\nWe were happy to find a bunch of beach toys and accesories (snorkeling gear, boggie boards, floaties) all clean and ready to use.  There are dozens and dozens of towels including beach towels.  There's little knick knacks that you don't considering packing but once you get there you realize you need (ziplock bags, wipes, etc.).  We can tell Tiara is very thoughtful and considerate of guest, young or old.  I'm huge when it comes to attention to detail and Tiara knocked it out of the ball park.  \r\n\r\nLastly the location is fantastic!  Two blocks from the heart of Waikiki beach, 5 minutes from the main freeway to get you to any other part of the island.  We spent probably only 15% of our time in Waikiki and the rest exploring the island (the North Shore, Kailua, the Lagoons by the Disney resort) and having such easy access around town was phenomonal.  \r\n\r\nWe look forward to our next stay here again!"},{"_id":"12710704","date":{"$date":"2014-05-09T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"660316","reviewer_id":"11553506","reviewer_name":"Dee Dee","comments":"The Waikiki Skytower was beautiful.

This condo beats hotel rooms in every aspect: size, amenities, large patio, etc..\r\n\r\n- Parking space included! Note that this is at least $35 value per day if you park outside. Not to mention the hassle of finding an available space along the street..\r\n\r\n- A *usable* kitchen. Unlike some other airbnb rooms, the kitchen in this condo was fully equipped. Plenty of dishes, pans, silverware, etc.. We even found a mixer.\r\n\r\n- Wonderful view. The pictures in the listing tell the truth. But we found the view at night was more wonderful.\r\n\r\nIf I'm to be nitpicking, then the only thing not that good was the amenities were a little bit old.

The well-stocked kitchen made it easy to go to the supermarket (a couple blocks up the street) and buy food and supplies instead of eating out every meal.  Rather than eating at a restaurant, it was far more pleasant to buy a plate dinner and some salad and fruit from the farmer's market, bring it back to the condo and eat out on the lanai with some beer and wine.  \r\n\r\nOverall, a wonderful stay, so much better than a hotel."},{"_id":"49307522","date":{"$date":"2015-10-03T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"660316","reviewer_id":"25202673","reviewer_name":"Soyoung","comments":"Tiare was very responsive.

A gorgeous high floor view and a fully equipped bathroom, kitchen, living room and bedroom with a washer and dryer that came in very handy once we started going to the beach (we reserved our first week for activities and started our short walks to the beach on our second week there). Tiare was an excellent and highly responsive hostess, giving clear directions for getting there and simple instructions upon our departure.  But the best part were the extras like her offering to print some documents when I needed that or responding within the hour to a washer problem that we experienced.  Tiare came in person to inspect and immediately called the technician who came and fixed the problem also within the hour.  This also gave us the wonderful opportunity to meet her in person which was very nice!

Nice kitchen with washer/dryer, very convenient for washing after swimming. We love the many towels that were stocked in bathroom. The shower was wonderful, very strong power pressure. The TV needs to be bigger. Elevator was fast going up and down. Parking downstairs was great, also gated. Great short walking distances to Waikiki beach and all the shops.

The view cannot be beat, my husband and I spent many hours just sitting on the balcony watching the city and ocean. Tiare has thought of everything, beach towels, cooking aids, you name it. The space is quiet (like super quiet, I'm one of those people who is super bothered by people playing music in rooms next to you or any random noises in my home space) and incredibly clean, and the breeze is so amazing that you never need to turn on the AC units.

This is our second time staying at Waikiki Towers and became easily familiar with the area. The location is walkable to everything with the beach being a short 10 minute walk. Check in and check out was easy. We had our privacy and it felt like it was our own little place. Everything you need is provided including beach towels, chairs and beach toys for the kids. The only thing the building is missing is a workout center which would have been the cherry on top. However, all the walking you do will definitely takes of those extra calories from being on vacation. I would say this is a great rental for families. My kids loved it. Not to mention, the building is very secure and you also have gated garage parking. Its safe to walk at night, there’s so much going on all the time. I would highly recommend this rental and would come back to stay again.

She sent detailed notes prior to our arrival in Hong Kong giving advice on how to get to the flat from the airport, details of local shops, restaurants and guidance about local transport around the city.  \r\nThe flat is a real gem!  It is located on the 14th Floor in an area surrounded by a variety of restaurants, and bars.  However it was extremely quiet.  We couldn't hear any street noise from inside the flat.  The building had a doorman and felt very safe.  Neighbours were extremely quiet and were very friendly.  The flat had been recently decorated and was beautifully presented  It is small which is normal for a flat so central but was ideal for three people.  The air conditioning, showers, washing machine etc worked perfectly.  Andrea was there to meet us on arrival and over the course of our 6 week stay was prompt in dealing with our queries.  We asked for an iron and ironing board and she delivered one the same day.  We had a cleaner every week and clean sheets and towels were provided.\r\n\r\nThe flat gives very easy access to all the sights of Hong Kong.  It is situated minutes from the Central Escalators and it takes no more than 20 minutes to walk to Central mtr , the Piers and to the Peak Tram.  It is about a 10 minute walk to the tram to Pacific Place/Causeway Bay area.\r\n\r\nI would recommend this flat and would have no hesitation in staying there again."},{"_id":"51895572","date":{"$date":"2015-10-25T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6609516","reviewer_id":"27187700","reviewer_name":"Shigejiro","comments":"We actually didn't get to stay in this apartment in front of TMQ.  There was a water problem few days before we arrived and it couldn't be fixed by the time we get there.  Instead Andrea offered a newly refurbished apartment on Po Hing Fong.  It was bit far from where we originally wanted to stay but turned out to be a very nice neighborhood.  8 minutes walk to Sai Ying Pun A1 exit (remind you from A1 exit you will need to walk another 8 minutes to get to the platform with the help of moving sidewalk). If you walk back to the apartment, you need to climb some slopes and stairs.  It's not something we enjoyed after eating and drinking much.  \r\n\r\nMany of the taxi drivers know how to get to Po Hing Fong, but when you go out you will need to go down to Tug Hwa Hospital or Hollywood Road to catch a taxi\r\n\r\nSo one reminder is when you leave the apartment with big luggage, it is not very easy to go down.  You may want to ask Andrea for the number of taxi company if you are travelling with many luggage or kids.\r\n\r\nThe apartment itself is very clean and nice with 2 bedrooms just enough to fit double bed in each of them.  Kitchen was small for any real cooking but we really didn' need to cook in Hong Kong.  Bathroom - I wish the toilet bowl was a tad bigger.  Showerbooth was ok with the water pressure on the weak side.  The heater provided very hot water so that helped.\r\n\r\nBed - the mattress was firm - just the way I liked it.  I kept my windows open and did not need to turn on the aircon.       \r\n\r\nAndrea was a great host.  On our first night, because the unit was still newly refurbished, there was no wifi installed, yet.  So she offered me to use her office nearby and her husband offered his iPhoneto be used as a hotspot.  I couldn't take it but it was a great gesture.

Typical Hong Kong small space apartment, however the mirror placements and decor helped a lot without the claustrophobic feel. Bathroom is spacious with hairdryer (which all of us ladies appreciate it so much).\r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood is AWESOME, close to many attractions and great bars. But follow Andrea's advice and take taxi there from MTR station (Hong Kong or even Central) because with the luggage it was super challenging with the steep hills! If taxi driver doesn't get the address (we even got scolded by them, so much for Hong Kong 'hospitable' service), tell them \"Aberdeen Street - PMQ\". Easiest milestone is a pressed juice shop on the corner.\r\n\r\n7-Eleven is just around the corner, Gage street fruit market is nearby, and we can just walk to famous food place (Tsui Wah, Mak's Noodles, etc).

Beds are quite firm but not as hard as some Asian mattresses I've slept on... one of the bedrooms has a fairly large closet with hangers and a hanging shoe rack, which was great for me. My favorite thing about the space is how bright and airy it is. It was a great sanctuary after walking around the city all day.\n\nThe only drawback was how humid it was in the apartment.... sheets and clothes constantly felt damp, which was pretty unpleasant. However, this is obviously beyond the host's control and is probably typical of every apartment in HK during humid weather.

We could have lived with all of that, but the biggest fault was the hostess. Never mind the fact that we didn’t get any tips or recommendations, the host just didn’t answer when she didn’t feel like it. She gave us her number, but when we wrote to her via whatsup, she said to only contact her via Airbnb. I made a mistake and booked an extra night- she answered she was busy and she will write later- which never happened. We asked to stay later on our last day- it took her a day to answer. In other words- the host didn’t host us at all. We arrived after a long flight, exhausted from it, there wasn’t even a tea bag in the kitchen. She blamed other guests for stealing the power adapters when I’ve had 5% battery.

In 2007, Park Slope was named one of the \"Greatest Neighborhoods in America\" by the American Planning Association \"for its architectural and historical features and its diverse mix of residents and businesses\".  And in December 2006, Natural Home magazine named Park Slope one of America's ten best neighborhoods, citing area greenspaces, neighborhood gathering spaces, local farmer's markets, strong public transportation, and interesting locally owned businesses.","notes":"Please note a few pieces of feedback we have received from our guests: 1) There are stairs leading down to the basement studio.

You do hear the train roll by ever so often, but it is a distant sound and did not interrupt our sleeping. The location is convenient and safe - many food stops/banks/drug stores close by.\r\n\r\nAs far as the host himself - Andrew provided me with information before I arrived and he was very keen on answering all of the (many) questions I had before we arrived.

It helps to keep your travel costs down to grab a delish breakfast and come back to bask in the sunshine on the private patio garden. The bathroom is great with a large shower. Downside for some is the absence of a TV (not for us) and a large book collection to peruse if you left your book at home.

The place was very clean and well stocked for visitors. The location was perfect for getting to Manhattan and was walkable to many shops, places to eat and a 24 hour Rite Aid. My family enjoyed the weekend and found the basement to be very comfortable. My only complaint was that there was no air conditioning and in the summer it was definitely hot down there. There are fans, but on a warm day the room was very hot. I would say putting in a wall air conditioning unit would be a great addition to enhance a persons stay in the summer months. Andrew was fair and reasonable when some things went awry with his water heater and when my child damaged a plant in his back yard-- I REALLY appreciated that. I thought he was an excellent host and would stay here again! I I would also recommend this spot to friends who would like to come to the city.

For two people it was more than enough room.  Andrew was an incredible host, very accommodating and always there to provide you with anything you need.  The location was perfect, in a very safe neighborhood that you can walk around at any time (even late at night) without any worries.  It is only a few minutes walk from the subway which makes it super convenient to go anywhere (and conversely, easy to get back to at any hour).  The private entrance makes it easy for you to get in and out of the room discretely without having to trouble the host, which is perfect for us since we would spend the entire day exploring all of NYC.  The bed was very comfortable for two people, we slept like a baby and woke up refreshed everyday.  The bathroom is newly renovated and very modern and comfortable.  There is also a dehumidifier which is sorely appreciated (Andrew thought of everything). All amenities were included, and when we ran low, a simple message to Andrew was all that was needed and he would take care of it.  He honestly wants to make sure you are having an enjoyable trip and is always there to make sure that it happens. When we come back to visit NYC we will definitely come back.

He was an attentive and respectful host.\r\n\r\nThe whole place was clean and comfortable. It would be very spacious for two or even three people, but if you use the convertible sofa as a queen-sized bed, there's not much room left in the main part of the apartment. The bed was very comfortable, the hide-a-bed mattress significantly less so. \r\n\r\nThe location is excellent -- less than a block to the subway station, a short train ride to lower Manhattan, and plenty of excellent restaurants, coffee shops, and other amenities around any corner.\r\n\r\nWe did not use the patio.

The neighbourhood itself felt very safe, plus the apartment is conveniently close to a metro station, shops and places to eat. I'd recommend staying here to anyone wanting to check out Park Slope/Brooklyn, and I personally wouldn't hesitate to stay here again for a future visit!"},{"_id":"215407071","date":{"$date":"2017-11-29T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6611547","reviewer_id":"6136866","reviewer_name":"Kayla","comments":"This was a great stay for a quick stop in NYC.

Park Slope great neighborhood if you want something less hustle-y bustle-y —a lot of young families and great places right around the corner for a quick bite or if you need anything. The actual space was very comfortable (the AC unit was a huge plus, and the bathroom was spotless) however you do hear the subway pretty much at all times, which is to be expected for the location. The space also felt very large and very private. it’s a  quick 20 minute train to downtown, and to get uptown takes you about 45, which doesn’t seem so bad if you’re familiar with public transit. Overall would recommend to anyone who is very comfortable with public transit and familiar with NYC, otherwise your uber’s may cost you a lot."},{"_id":"245527115","date":{"$date":"2018-03-22T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6611547","reviewer_id":"912481","reviewer_name":"Mirek","comments":"Andrew's place was exactly what we were looking for: clean, centrally located and within walking distance of a lot of different restaurants and bars, and private.

Only downside is that it is underground with no natural light. However the AC and dehumidifier keep it cool and dry - but these can be noisy at night, as can the fridge. Although there is a fridge and microwave it'd be hard to do more than breakfast or make sandwiches as there's no counter space or kitchen sink.

Francisco was super responsive, even while on vacation with his family, and Gonzy - his brother - met us at the metro, showed us the apartment, drew a detailed map of everything we should see in Porto, and then personally led us to an excellent dinner spot and a to a bar to listen to fado.

Furthermore there were some building guys renovating the neighbouring flat starting at 8am (maybe only in July?)\r\n\r\n- windows blade not really \"fixed\" and lightcovering. May be an issue if you don't like to be woken up early by the morning light\r\n- bedmattress in the bedroom: you feel the steel springs, not comfortable at all. By chance there was the sofa in the living room. Ok for one week if your friend doesn't move too much by night.\r\n- toilet paper forgotten at our arrival and cleaning lady came before the agreed leaving time at our departure day. It can happen but it would be good to pay great attention to such essential details.\r\n\r\nHaving this in mind, we still would recommend the flat to other Porto travellers :)\r\nObrigado.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nAurélie"},{"_id":"87286518","date":{"$date":"2016-07-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6639953","reviewer_id":"5619193","reviewer_name":"Michelle","comments":"The appartment is great, same as the pictures.

The apartment is super well located, in the middle of old town/ shopping district, everything is reachable in a 20 minutes walk. The flat was cleaned nicely. Only negative thing is the amount of the hot water, you have to save some to be able to take a shower, although it was march, in the summer it should not be a problem I guess. So all together is a great apartment to rent to get to know Porto and around."},{"_id":"138212189","date":{"$date":"2017-03-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6639953","reviewer_id":"27228701","reviewer_name":"David","comments":"We stayed for two nights in Franciscos AirBnB, the location was perfect, directly located at the biggest shopping street of Porto. Nightlife was just 5 minutes walk, as well as the Waterfront near the River. We found everything in our accomodation we searched for. The furniture as not been very emotional but everything you need is at the right spot! The only thing, we worried about has been a construction site just one house further down the street, on Friday we woke up early because it was a little bit noisy, but on the weekend it was alright!

It was also close to shops, restaurants, cafes, nightlife, the historic district and various other nice sites.

Our flight was delayed resulting in a late arrival at the apartment. Having called Francisco on arrival this was not a problem and Francisco arranged for his brother to meet us and take us through everything at the apartment. His brother detailed all the great things to do in Porto on a map, of which we took great pleasure in ticking off! Thanks for your suggestions. The apartment was situated in a fantastic spot! You will find shops, restaurants, bakeries, cafes and bars within in a short walking distance... literally the moment you walk out of the door. We very much enjoyed Cafe Majestic \u0026 Bop, which are only a stone throw away. You can walk to the river within 15 minutes and along the way you'll find lot's of cafes, restaurants and tourist attractions. There is also a taxi pick up/drop off point close to the apartment making it easy to get around if you'd rather not use the metro or buses that are also only 2 mins away from the apartment. Oh and a market selling fresh veg, fruit, cheese, meats and other goodies! I can not express how perfect the apartment was located for us! The apartment suited our needs perfectly and we very rarely spent much time there other than to shower and sleep. We did cook a take on the classic English Breakfast one day and even though the kitchen is small cooking up sausages, bacon, eggs, tomatoes and toast was not an issue. Lot's of pots, pans and cooking utensils available although the kitchen would benefit from the purchase of a toaster in my opinion. The under counter fridge/freezer was large enough to accommodate our requirements having stayed for a week. There is also an iron and ironing board available if you need it. Overall the apartment is fantastic, it's not 5* but certainly works as a superb base for you trip and at the end of the day, holidays or not to be spent indoors! My only additional suggestion would be to provide more towels however I am 100% sure if I had called Francisco to ask for more then he would have been happy to arrange for this. Porto is an absolutely amazing city! The people are extremely friendly and enthusiastic to help tell you about the history and hidden gems within their amazing city! The nightlife is buzzing, loads of cocktail bars (I recommend the Tonic Porto's) and everything else on the cocktail menu haha! There are some distilleries to have Port tasting sessions. You can jump on a very affordable tuk tuk tour around the city, jump on a boat or even a ride on a cable cart. There is a wealth of history within Porto and there are tonnes of historical monuments, churches, chapels and museums to explore. We enjoyed discovering the places that you'll not find as many tourists and although this can mean an 2 hour walk you can hire a bike..."},{"_id":"161719507","date":{"$date":"2017-06-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6639953","reviewer_id":"5106128","reviewer_name":"Markus","comments":"Despite our late arrival, Francisco and his friend gave us a warm welcome at the flat and gave us great tips what to do, where to eat and so on (follow his advice on where to eat fish, it's worth it!).

The apartment is extremely well situated—close to many tourist hotspots but also within easy walking distance of the old city and Ribeira. The stairs up three floors were less of a hassle than I expected and the bed was wide and comfortable. The view out over the largely pedestrianised Rua Santa Caterina is endlessly fascinating and while the noise levels increase towards the end of the week, I did not find this a problem. Being on the edge of the inner city, I was also encouraged to explore the northern arc from Trindade to Campanhã to areas such as Bonfim where relatively few tourists are encountered and real life plays out. \n\nThe apartment is good value for money, but correspondingly cuts some corners and if at all fussy or fastidious you would be advised to look elsewhere. The facilities are basic and slightly tired. The kitchen facilities are extremely modest. Some basics such as toilet paper and a tea towel were lacking. The wifi was flaky at first but Francisco promptly responded to my pleas for help and the problem was resolved. (Hint—plug the modem directly into the USB socket of your laptop; downloading the NOS app seemed to help also.) Portugal is noted for many achievements and excellences but it is not a world leader in plumbing so expect a few malodourous moments (the incense burning in the stairwell gives you the hint) and some erratic behaviour of the basics. The sink and basin are well behaved but the shower answers to itself—it was usually either cold or scalding hot with little nuance in between. Make the most of good moments here. \n\nBut it is hard to be too critical of this apartment given its price and location, and I would recommend it for the seasoned single traveller or younger couple seeking clean, basic accommodation."},{"_id":"303332080","date":{"$date":"2018-08-07T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6639953","reviewer_id":"185474995","reviewer_name":"Coutant Georget","comments":"Super bon emplacement mais rue et immeuble un peu bruyant (travaux...) l'appart gagnerait à avoir quelques équipements en plus.

There is also multiple cafes on the doorstep and 2 mini-supermarkets about 5 minutes walk away.\n\nWe chose this apartment as it was a) the same price as a room in Porto but with the comfort of an entire apartment\nb) the amazing location\nWould I stay again? No, probably not, unless Francisco listens to the reviews and gives the apartment some updates and provides more basic amenities. We had a fab time in Porto but it was a shame the apartment wasn't the standard we've had across Portugal on our trip.\n\nIf you chose to stay here then note there is no shampoo, very few kitchen utensils, no mugs, no toaster or microwave and a random array of cupboard \"bits\" (E.g. Pasta \u0026 rice crackers) and the kitchen cloths looked like they'd been used for several months. There is a fan in the bedroom but not much sound insulation from the street below as there is no shutter for the bedroom doors. \nFrancisco was quite slow to reply to messages and did need follow-up messages to get a response, but he was very prompt to check in and seemed a nice guy. He sat down to orientate ourselves with the map and gave some personal suggestions which were great!"},{"_id":"316007001","date":{"$date":"2018-08-30T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6639953","reviewer_id":"77932633","reviewer_name":"Alina","comments":"The flat was really nice.

Die Lage war wirklich super, direkt in der zentralen Einkaufsstraße (logischerweise ist es dadurch nachts und morgens relativ laut, geräuschempfindlich darf man nicht sein). Leider war die Wohnung nicht wirklich sauber, es gab Schimmel an der Decke, die Handtücher waren fleckig, der Boden fühlte sich staubig an, die Duscharmaturen waren überaus verkalkt und auch die Ecken im Bad waren nicht geputzt. Zudem stank es extrem im Hausflur - wir wissen nicht, woher dieser Geruch kam, jedoch stank es nach Fekalien. Die Begrüßung war durchwachsen, erst war die Gastgeberin etwas patzig, dann hat sie sich Mühe gegeben und uns nützliche Tipps für unseren Aufenthalt in Porto gegeben und auch einen Portwein zur Begrüßung organisiert. Die Gastgeberin war allerdings nicht die Person, auf die wir uns eingestellt hatten - wir hatten viele Monate im Voraus bei einem Francisco gebucht und kurz vor Ankunft schrieb uns eine Chris, dass sie die neue Gastgeberin ist - Francisco hatte super Airbnb-Bewertungen, Chris leider nicht - und unsere Erfahrung war wie beschrieben nicht gerade schön.

The apartment is nicely decorated but could be better cleaned. The building is old and there is not much ventilation, especially in the bathroom.

It's a very social house with lots of visitors and sometimes an extra person would stay. It didn't bother me too much as the place is spacious and everyone was very friendly. I guess the only issue was that the dog isn't house trained so you would find the occasional 'presents' around the house (especially in the kitchen that wasn't so nice).

The building is guarded 24/7 so we felt very safe, its in copscabana next to a bank, a super market, a variety of restaurants and its just across the road fron the beach. And still, the biggest advantage of all is Mari herself! Mari makes it feels like home,she helps with everything! And she is always there. She is a warm, loving and kind woman. We have enjoyed every moment and were sad to leave."},{"_id":"259718538","date":{"$date":"2018-05-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"664017","reviewer_id":"39772669","reviewer_name":"Thomas","comments":"깨끗하고 접근성이 좋습니다. 다소 개소리때문에 시끄럽지만 동네 특성인듯 합니다. 추천합니다"}]}
