Since the apartment is located on the hill, the options getting there is quite limited. You can get there by taking the escalator but I highly recommend taking the taxi downhill as it only costs you about HK$30-40  then you have plenty options of transportations that you can take to places. \n\nNate and Anthi are amazing. They have been super helpful and accommodating throughout our entire stay at the apartment. \n\nThank you so much again.

She had also very kindly left three Opal cards for us to access public transport easily, which we made use of.\nHer apartment could not be more central as within minutes we were in the shopping area or The Rocks near the harbour. As this was our first time in Sydney, this made it very easy to navigate and see all the attractions we had intended to.\nShe had high speed Wi-Fi in the apartment and the rooftop pool and spa definitely relaxed us in the evenings. We also made use of the hotel restaurant which had very friendly staff and good food.

It is in a building shared with a hotel, and although reception has nothing to do with this AirBnB, it means when you come home at night you feel safe. The apartment is spacious, and it has good air conditioning. There is currently some building work on George Street, but it was not an issue, it's on a par with any other city noise you would expect in a town - we did not notice it at all and it was very quiet at night. We stayed for 6 nights and we were not disturbed by any people or traffic noise at all. The beds were very clean and comfy, there is plenty of linen/towels in the flat, and also some basic food (tea, milk, sugar) and toiletries, which is great when you arrive after a flight.

This place does NOT have an elevator. The elevator goes ALMOST to the floor it's on, but not quite. So if you have mobility issues or don't want to haul your luggage up a few flights of stairs, you're out of luck.\n2. The Wifi NEVER works. So better bring your own - even though it says there's Wifi here, there isn't. Doesn't matter how many times Jessica comes over to \"fix\" it. Guaranteed less than 12 hours before check-in you'll get a note saying \"oh the Wifi isn't working, but it should be fixed today!\" That's bull. The Wifi never works.\n3. The bedrooms are NOT bedrooms - they have NO closets and NO doors.\n4. The bathroom spray attachment is held together with a bent, rusty wire hanger.\n5. The tap water smells like sewage.\n6. Location: Right in the middle of streetwalker alley. If you are either a) a prostitute, or b) looking to pick one up for cheap, this is the place for you. You're a disgusting sex tourist, but hey - have at it. If you DON'T want to stay in someone else's for-pay wet spot, though, avoid this place like the plague.\n7.

I happened to have booked my trip during El Merce, which is a 4-5 day long festival that happens all over the city. \r\n\r\nThe location is absolutely perfect if you intend to use the Barcelona Metro (which I recommend), it is near the D50 and D20 buses as well as Mercat Nou or Sants metro station. Talking about 5 minute or less walk to any of these stations. From there you are connected to all of Barcelona and it rarely took me longer than 30 min to get anywhere. \r\n\r\nLast tip! If you like Japanese food and buffet's there is one just a few minutes away called Koyo, about 10 euros gets you unlimited sushi, gyoza, and etc.!\r\n\r\nPlace was perfect for me, when I travel I don't spend too much time in my accommodations other than to sleep or rest.

You are 10 minutes from Williamsburg, which was great for me since the nightlife there is awesome. Bedford Stuyvesant is a very safe neighborhood, with small jewels like cozy bars, cafes, wineries, restaurants and friendly people (this one a rare condition in manhattan new yorkers). A boheme experience if you are looking for more than the traditional touristic experience. Ravanna is accessible, always pending on your needs, but never overwhelming.

I didn't meet Ravanna directly, as it was his brother Jetta who was taking care of my stay, but let me tell you, he could not have been a more warm, lovely, and hospitable host! I was travelling with my parent's and my dad managed to get the sink stopper stuck in the kitchen sink (of course) - Jetta was 100% understanding and instantly fixed it! When I arrived he also gave me some great tips on where to eat and pick up things like groceries and alcohol, which was really helpful (I needed a good drink after a long day of travelling!).\r\n\r\nThe apartment itself is exactly as it looks in the photos! Everything was freshly cleaned when we arrived, and the comfortable beds were a welcoming site after my parents were delayed up in Toronto for a number of hours. The apartment is EXTREMELY quiet, and we never heard anyone else in the building, even though we were told there was a group staying below us, which was absolutely wonderful. \r\n\r\nEverything about booking and staying at this location was quick, easy, and very pleasant. I would highly recommend this location to anyone who doesn't want to be in Manhattan and is looking for a more \"local\" feel to their stay in NYC. With that being said, my parents and I found travelling up or down Bedford (instead of Nostrand) was much better, especially at night to and from the subway lines. The A line was closed for most of the time that we were there, so we ended up taking the G line from Bedford-Nostrand and then connecting to the L line at Lorimer into Manhattan for most of the time we were there and actually really enjoyed that commute, as it allows you to jump off at Williamsburg (Bedford stop on the L line) on your way into Manhattan! \r\n\r\nI hope to be back in NYC in the next few years and would feel great about staying at this location again :)"},{"_id":"10903013","date":{"$date":"2014-03-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1646432","reviewer_id":"3136118","reviewer_name":"Gerald","comments":"I can certainly recommend Ravanna's house.

The apartment was comfortable and clean. \r\n\r\n The master bedroom was very large and provided us with lots of space to spread out.  The second bedroom was smaller but our friends did not seem to complain.  The beds in both rooms were all prepared for our arrival and were very comfortable.  My only complaint about the bedrooms is that the window shades did not really provide much shelter from daylight in the early morning.  Not great for a light sleeper. \r\n\r\n The kitchen was well equipped but quite small.  I imagine this is normal for NYC apartments and we managed quite easily with the limited space.  We were not anticipating cooking for a party of 10 so the kitchen suited our needs quite well.  \r\n\r\nThe living room was very spacious and clean.  We were two couples and we had plenty of space to relax and kick back after a long day out in the city.  The wireless internet provided was very useful to plan our dinners and sightseeing routing.  The large flat screen tv kept us entertained during March Madness while we waited for the girls to get back from shopping.\r\n\r\nThe Norstrand stop for the A and C lines was a 5 minute walk away and took us into Manhattan within 15 minutes.  Taxis on Bedford street were readily available to take us to Williamsburg for some delicious dinners and good bars.\r\n\r\nLastly, the towels provided for us were amazing. I stay in hotels on a weekly basis and these towels were the softest ones I have ever used.\r\n\r\nAll in all we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would go back again.  Any questions or issues were addressed quickly.

Ravanna's brother, Jeddah, was very accommodating and greeted us when we came in late at night (12:30pm). He even let us check out late (noon) and stored our luggage for us in his room until our flight. The place was spacious and clean and within walking distance of restaurants and markets. If you are coming in late, be sure to check out Black Swan, they serve food until 3pm! This place is great for big groups, as there are plenty of fold out beds in the closet. It is a quiet street which is nice after a long day touring NYC. I would recommend this place to anyone vising NYC. It takes around 35-45 minutes with walking and subway to get to south central park in Manhattan. Taxi rides from Mid Manhattan to the place range about $30-$35. Our lyft ride was $38 from JFK to the house at night with no traffic."},{"_id":"21276432","date":{"$date":"2014-10-14T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1646432","reviewer_id":"15887402","reviewer_name":"Dottie","comments":"Our stay at Ravanna's couldn't have been better.

He showed us around and we were happy to see that the property was as displayed in the pictures on his site. \r\nThe suite was spacious, clean, and the beds comfortable. All the comforts of home except a couple of wine glasses would have been nice. As it was, we roughed it by having our coffee mugs do double duty, lol!\r\n Lots of brochures and maps available to help make choices for places to eat and how to get around on the subway. The subway stop was about a 5-10 minute walk through a safe neighborhood. It takes anywhere from 25 to 45 minutes to get to downtown Manhattan, depending on the time of day you travel, with start and end of workday being the busiest (naturally). By the way, I would recommend buying the $30. subway card. We were there for 4 days and easily spent that much in single subway fares.\r\nThere's a very well stocked supermart within walking distance and for Mexican we loved the huge tasty burritos at a quirky place called Taqueria Villa Pancho at 1047 Bedford, and another evening very much enjoyed dinner and wine across the street at a place called Black Swan (1048 Bedford).\r\nWhen we had a question, I wasn't able to get hold of Ravanna by phone or text after our initial meeting but when we resorted to ringing his doorbell we got the information we needed from another occupant of his home.\r\nI would stay in Ravanna's place again.

The major downside for me was that *very* strong cleaners, detergents, and air fresheners are clearly used to clean this place-- and the smell gave me pretty extreme nausea. I actually opted to stay elsewhere for part of the trip because being in the apartment was so unpleasant. Aside from the scent issue, the apartment itself was reasonably as represented. The furniture was a bit worn, and the doorknob and lock were flimsy, but if it hadn't been for the smell I believe we would have enjoyed our stay. \r\n\r\nI never actually met Ravanna-- his sister let us in, and his nephew (very nicely) brought us more blankets around midnight because I thought replacement blankets might smell less strongly of industrial detergent. However, he was incredibly responsible by phone and text. I think this would be a good place to stay for a big group of people planning to go to NYC and not spend a lot of time in the apartment (and who aren't sensitive to scents, obviously). \r\n\r\nVery sorry to give these nice people a 2-star review, but the apartment unfortunately didn't really meet our needs.

She had the necessary beds out for us and they all had fresh linens, and there were plenty of towels too. The kitchen had all the necessary dishes and utensils to make meals; all you had to do was take the groceries. The place was clean and organized. We had no problem with this, but it might be helpful for others to know due to age or physical activity. We had the 3rd floor of the condo, so there are quite a bit of flight of stairs to climb, and the walk to the nearest sub station was about 6 blocks away.

Our hosts were super easy to work with, communicative and flexible, didn't ask for much from us on checkout. The kitchen is pretty tiny, just enough standing room for one person at a time, but as long as you aren't doing a ton of cooking, it has all the amenities you could want -- bagel-sized toaster, microwave, gas stove, full-size fridge, 6-cup auto-drip coffee maker. The shower was great. Tons of nice soft \u0026 clean towels/linens, ironing board and iron, even paid-subscription cable channels on a nice big-screen TV. We really enjoyed staying here and felt the hosts took great care of us. The property is within walking distance of a variety of grocery/convenience stores, a few restaurants/bars, and a few different subway stops. As a fairly naive tourist from Oregon, the neighborhood felt a little less safe than I would prefer, but without much NYC experience to compare it to, it's hard to say if that was just my imagination.

The amenities are bare basics and nothing fancy.\nRooms are a good size for NYC.\nSome pieces of furniture were well worn, others seem brand new.  Appears the host is continuing to make improvements, which is great.\nIt is a pretty far walk from the A line, but still felt pretty safe even late at night.  Street was also very quiet.\nThere are grocery stores at each end of the block, which was convenient.\nWe had some frustration with the fitted sheets coming off every night, leaving us sleeping on the uncovered mattress, which appeared new, but still not a pleasant situation.  I encouraged the host to get mattress covers for the beds and some deeper pocketed sheets.  Hopefully they do.\nHost did not respond to any form of contact when we accidentally locked ourselves out one morning.  After a couple of hours with no return contact, we eventually called a locksmith. We buzzed the first floor apartment to ask them to let us through the main door, and it turned out to be the host who gave us a spare set of keys but we still ended up having to pay the locksmith because for driving to the location.  Host never mentioned us trying to contact him.\nSummary: cheap place to stay in Brooklyn.  Worth what they charge.

You are in an old part of town which is what we wanted and there were lots of shops and bakeries on every corner. Diego was so helpful and a delight.

If you are looking for a place for the sole purpose of sleeping - great option. But if you are looking for a place to be able to feel comfortable in the space if you have an hour to chill I would look elsewhere (couch was uncomfortable and smelled slightly, beds were extremely stiff, kitchen chairs were also bad to the point of needing a pillow from bedroom to aid in comfort). During the evening the outside noise travelled into the bedrooms, as if the windows were open, but that was minor considering we were downtown.

The only downside for us was the people who are up above this space.  While Antoine cannot control this, if you're a light sleeper I would recommend taking earplugs.  I slept in the bedroom closest to the front door and didn't notice it as much at night time as my daughter did who was in the other bedroom.  Other than that our stay was perfect.

To begin with Esperanza and her family are very well coming people and socially interactive, that you feel to be at home. Esperanza's well come was special from the other places I stayed in so far that she explained me every thing including the bus and tram stations before my arrival. And also she explained me that when I arrive at her place, I will find some body to well come me and that was very true that she herself welcomed me.\nUp on my arrival to her place she explained me every thing regarding the use of amenities in the room as well as the facilities in the neighborhood. She printed out maps for public bus and metro transport as well as for supermarkets and restaurants in the neighborhood.\nThe room has a heater, air conditioner, a very large flat screen TV, a very large locker, a light bulb near by the bed with a small locker. There is also a nice chair with wheels and a corresponding big table. With this spacious room and the various amenities it has, I have really enjoyed my stay as a student. There is also shared bathroom with alternatives(meaning two bathrooms) as well. There is secured wifi and a laptop friendly environment. Since I will be staying for three weeks and since I am a student she has specially allowed me to use the kitchen and the washing machine and that was wonderful for me.\nRegarding location of Esperanza's place, it is centrally located that you can get every thing including supermarkets, cafeterias , metro station  at walking distance of less than 3  minutes.\nIn conclusion Esperanza's place is a place I would like to stay in when ever I come back to Barcelona in the future and it is also a place I will advise my friends all other people to stay at."},{"_id":"133696632","date":{"$date":"2017-02-24T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16479542","reviewer_id":"106000699","reviewer_name":"Kusse Koirita","comments":"It is my second time to stay at Esperanzaz's place and for sure it will always be my first choice when ever I plan to come to Barcelona in the future.\n\nEsperanza and her family are a very kind and caring people, highly well coming. \n\nEsperanza's place is centrally located, very near for public transport access(just 2 min walk to the metro station), full choice of supermarkets and restaurants nearby including a 24 hr serving supermarket.\n\nEsperanza's room is a clean with all the amenities available as mentioned on the website. It is also a quiet place best suited for students like me.\n\nI could not believe when I finished my study and was about to leave Esperanza's family. I wish I would stay with and continue having a great time with such a respectful family, but as a matter of nature I had to go for my study in another country. But for sure Esperanza's place will always be my first place when ever I am planning to come to Barcelona in the future.\n\nI was very much astonished when Esperanza's Dad and Mom surprised me with gifts, not only this her Dad has also given me an all way lift right to the airway during my flight.

He made sure to send me the directions to his place and he even came down the building to help us with our luggage. He was very quick to reply to messages and he made us feel welcomed and safe. Even after check out, he made sure we got to the airport on time and safely.\n\nThe place: Gary's place is very convenient. It is very close both to Jordan and Austin stations. There's a lot of eating place around the area as well and it is walking distance from the Temple street. It's pretty safe and quiet at the area. Take note, Gary is a musician so he has lots of instruments in his living room. Nonetheless, the rooms were clean and comfy.\n\nOverall, my bro and I were satisfied at our stay.

His responses to queries were prompt and helpful. He was also extremely flexible on check-in,  which was important for me because I arrived in HK at 12 midnight. Room was clean and tidy. Toilet/Bathroom was ok, and within expectations given price. Living room was cluttered with musical instruments and equipment (Gary's a bassist), but it didn't bother me.  Location was decent (near MTR) and still somewhat walkable (15mins) even from the Kowloon Airport Express station. This is important for red eye travellers,  as while the Airport Express runs past midnight,  the MTR lines connected to the Airport Express cease operations around 1220am or so,  which means you might not be able to get to your place via MTR at that time. Building is in a very local area though, somewhat analogous to Manhattan's Alphabet City, so it might not be entirely suited for luxury seekers.  All things considered, room was great value,  and Gary was a fantastic host!"},{"_id":"217357708","date":{"$date":"2017-12-09T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16493868","reviewer_id":"159528486","reviewer_name":"梁","comments":"Gary哥人很好,到楼下接我上去,还给我很多当地的攻略以及餐馆推荐｡房子在的地理位置很棒,去哪里都很方便,非常有香港味道,真的值得一去!房间在十一楼,设施都很齐全,也很舒服干净,度过了很棒的两个晚上,下次再去HK还会住在这里的!"},{"_id":"218085223","date":{"$date":"2017-12-11T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16493868","reviewer_id":"85856454","reviewer_name":"Echo","comments":"Gary的房子位置非常好找  逛街也很方便｡而且房主人特别好  很热心  这是第二次住这里  感觉如果来香港 可以很放心的再次入住"},{"_id":"218311365","date":{"$date":"2017-12-12T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16493868","reviewer_id":"161511696","reviewer_name":"Pat","comments":"柯士甸地铁站一出来就能找得到,位置很好,交通便利!房间很干净舒适!最主要的是gary人超级nice!!很热心,很耐心得回答各种问题!非常棒!"},{"_id":"218626266","date":{"$date":"2017-12-14T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16493868","reviewer_id":"160924817","reviewer_name":"Jiner","comments":"地理位置真的很方便,想去哪里可以问问房东先生他会给你指明方向,附近有什么好吃的也会推荐,人生地不熟在附近迷路也会非常贴心出来带｡暖心的小哥哥"},{"_id":"218774270","date":{"$date":"2017-12-15T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16493868","reviewer_id":"159413316","reviewer_name":"Bryce","comments":"房东Gary真的超热情的 而且生活用品准备得很充分｡\n距离station很近,去哪里都比较方便｡\n房间干净整洁｡\n只是toilet早晚的时候比较挤｡"},{"_id":"218968074","date":{"$date":"2017-12-16T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16493868","reviewer_id":"107337989","reviewer_name":"Michael","comments":"I had a short stay and met Gary, who is a very friendly and accommodating host.

Mostly as it is situated centrally in a really nice part of the city, which made it a great experience for us. Wifi was also good. However, some things were a bit sub par, even for being airbnb. \n\nCommunication was mostly very good with fast responses, but unfortunately we got directions on how to get the key one day too late, which resulted in some unneccessary stress. Not having a key for our room was also a bit stressful as there was another guest staying in the other room at the same time. Although it was probably a nice person, it would be nice to be able to lock your things away. Not too clean either, but totally fine for just staying/sleeping there."},{"_id":"271643276","date":{"$date":"2018-06-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16495969","reviewer_id":"74707767","reviewer_name":"Anand","comments":"Decent place at a good location with supportive host."},{"_id":"278418388","date":{"$date":"2018-06-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16495969","reviewer_id":"179454764","reviewer_name":"Melanie","comments":"It was our first time in Hong Kong and it is a very big, exciting and expensive city.

Extremely nice and welcoming neighbors, a bit chatty but in a warm way. Awesome location, close enough if you need any tourist information or anything close to Sagrada Familia but it's in a neighborhood that's more predominately lived in by locals. It's close to three different metro lines for easy access to anywhere else in the city. VERY safe and quiet at night, I slept like a baby every night I was there and had breakfast on the terrace. Easy check in/check out, Susana met me and dropped off the key and then met me when I left. Great service! Wifi was fantastic, never had a problem, good speed and reached all parts of the apartment including the patio.

The apartment is very well decorated, with great interior design. It doesn't look like it but the bedroom is open concept without a wall to close it off and the door is mostly see through, so if you're looking for privacy that might be an issue. \n\nAt night, it can get pretty chilly as there isn't central heating so prepare to bundle up. Another issue I had was the noise late at night, because there is on street parking outside the apartment (which was hard to secure a spot), tow trucks would come around and tow illegal park. They normally alert you with loud sirens before actually towing. Then snow plows would follow to clear out big snow banks. This was annoying as it made it difficult to sleep. The neighbourhood also has many interesting characters.\n\nOther than that, everything was good, keys were easy to access, the apartment was equipped with amenities and was clean. Barbara was also very quick to respond to messages. I would recommend staying here with friends as it's a big space!"},{"_id":"141290821","date":{"$date":"2017-04-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16507273","reviewer_id":"41197814","reviewer_name":"Freddy","comments":"Great stay.

Barbara had already left at this point for her own trip, but she came back, got us in and settled and provided a different key that worked better with the lock. \nMy friend and I visited Montreal on a weekend where they were experiencing a heat wave, so not having air conditioning was a bit of a bummer. But the place has two balconies, one in the front and one in the back, so we opened the doors and had fresh air coming in through the apartment which was nice. \nBarbara has done a great job in decorating the place. She’s an artist so it makes sense. It’s definitely a cute and stylish spot and friend I left with inspiration as to how we may want to decorate our own places! :) \nThank you again Barbara for letting us stay at your apartment.

They also provided fruit and water, along with brochures for local attractions.

The location is in the rural area and we were definitely glad to find it during the daytime.  Diana went out of her way to provide extra toiletries for us after our baggage was delayed.  The fresh fruit and water was also appreciated!  The location is off the beaten path but great for relaxing - you can hear the birds and enjoy the tranquility of the space.  There is another single unit on the property but no one was there while we stayed and there seems to be enough privacy if they did.  The location is a bit further from Hilo but easy to access and a good starting point for the volcano park and 61g east access viewing.  Overall we were very happy with our stay!

There is a Foodland about 15 min from the house and on the way to the park so I was able to stop and grab food for the day driving around the park. \n\nThe place feels very secluded especially at night because it gets very dark as there is little light pollution. Arriving late at night and in the dark the place was easy to find because it was clearly marked and there was great directions from the host. \n\nI had issues with my flight so I landed 6 hours after I was supposed to.

I loved the shopping plaza nearby for groceries and takeout. I did not read the details closely and it was hot inside when I arrived, but cooled off quickly after I opened all the windows. No AC if you plan on staying inside on a brutally hot day, and the fan is less than optimal. There is a TV, but strictly for DVD use.  I was able to watch Merrie Monarch online, but only in certain areas was the WiFi signal strong enough to stream on my phone. The space is super clean, there was fresh fruit and bottled water in the mini fridge. The bed is comfortable. The coquis frogs are deafening, and I live on Oahu, so I don’t come to Big Island to hear nature sounds, especially invasive species. Closing the windows cuts the noise by 50%, which you can do if it cools down. Due to the noise, I would not stay here again as I am a very light sleeper.

Danny was very nice and easy to communicate with. However, while this apartment can be a great value for a large group, it was a little rough around the edges. For example, the oven was caked with grease and there was an old carpet and doors on the balcony. Also, there were supplies to repair the drawer rollers in the bedroom. However, my 8 year old pulled a drawer out on her foot which took us to the ER for an afternoon so I'm thinking the repair hadn't been completed.

The house looked like a model home which was homey and beautifully decorated. They received us with fresh flowers on the table and a basket of wine and goodies. There was everything in the house to make you feel right at home-- all the kitchenware, cleaning supplies, towels, iron/ironing board, hair dryer, shower gel, extra blankets. The beds seemed new and the linens were fresh and very good quality.  It is beachfront property so morning walks were relaxing, the sunset was gorgeous and star gazing at night was spectacular. They also have a closet full of board games, books and a tv. You can buy food at the grocery store and have the most perfect vacation staying home at this property without having to even step out of the house.  Of course, there's a million things to do around here which my family and I did being out or first time in New Zealand but we very much enjoyed every minute of our stay at this house. I would give it an 11 out of 10 and would definitely recommend it. PS- the driveway into the house is a little steep and narrow. It was my first time driving in NZ and with the steering wheel on the right side but I had no trouble getting in and out of the driveway... just be careful and go slow :)"},{"_id":"249232682","date":{"$date":"2018-04-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16551368","reviewer_id":"171521373","reviewer_name":"Cath","comments":"Great place to stay.

The main problem was the sofa bed which is clearly not a good enough quality for 2 people, perhaps suitable for one person. A little trouble as well with the windows who let the cold air in (can be cold in winter when sleeping in the sofa bed, even with the heating on).\n\nOn the plus side, communication is good and we were able to check in 2 hours early very easily. The location is very practical to visit Sydney. The pool is nice.\n\nOrher than that you have what you need in the appartement but unfortunately you get the feeling early on that it is clearly not an appartement with people living in it permanently (only 4 knives, forks, spoons, glasses etc, and the atmosphere is quite \"cold\").\n\nOverall, very good location and practical, with good communication, but the second bed is clearly not good enough.

Keyless entry is brilliant, bed is unbelievably comfortable (and I am not a good sleeper in strange places, I slept very well here). Kitchen seemed well stocked, though I am not much of a chef so i didn't really take advantage of that. Very warm \u0026 inviting common area, and free HBO (not that anyone would watch HBO while in Maui). As they say: Location Location Location. And Mike's house rocked the location, 5 minute walk to downtown Paia which has plenty of food \u0026 store fronts (and an awesome Health Food store - Mana foods - the only one on the island). Paia is also the base for the ascent to Haleakala Summit, whether you plan to drive up or do as I did and peddle a bike 10,023 feet in 36 miles... it's a must see experience! If there were one thing that I would offer critical critique on, it would be that the keyless entry door mechanism has a indicator light on the inside that strobes rather bright. When you go dark for bedtime, the strobing white light can be a little distracting for light sleepers like myself. But it's nothing a washcloth draped over the door knob can't cure, and really it's so minor of an issue it's easy to look past. I will most definitely visit Maui again, and there is no doubt in my mind where I will stay... Mike's House!

More of a quality small market rather than a typical convenient store. \n\nThe place had local Hawaiian character and was clean, comfortable and homey. The whole house/room was thoughtfully set up with everything you could need in the room and attached patio room, and the community kitchen. Having available laundry facilities in the house was nice too. It was really convenient having a code for the main door and room, rather than having to always carry around a key. Read the other reviews that talk more about all these details. \n\nI really appreciated having my own half bath in my room, and spent a lot of time in the pleasant porch room where you could feel the cool breezes and be protected from bugs. Small lizards make their way through the floor boards (since it's really an outdoor patio but is screened in like a room), but that actually added made the experience more interesting.

As Ann lives here and works from home, this isn't a place to hang out in.

There are a lot of pros, but also two cons. \r\n\r\nAnn is very friendly and helpful. She was always there when I had questions. \r\nThe location is simply great. It's only a two minutes walk to the next subway station (W 4 St). The neighborhood is charming and safe, there are tons of cafés, restaurants and shops nearby. I especially liked Amy's Bread (Leroy/Bleecker) for Breakfast and Coffee, the Risotteria (Bleecker) and the fantastic Falafel at Taim (222 Waverly Place) for dinner. \r\nMy room on the first floor was big enough and clean. The bed was comfy and there was also a small couch to sit and relax. With regard to the location it is really tough to find a Hotel room for this rate with similar amenities. \r\n\r\nBut there were also two little downsides. As a guest had mentioned before there was a light smell on the ground floor. It might be from the two cats, although there are exceptionally clean and very cute by the way. But since I slightly noticed the smell in my room and had to work there for a while, I bought a small air refresher. After that it was fine. \r\nSecond, the noise level. For New York, the room is mostly quite, since Leroy Street has almost no through travel and there is no Bus station nearby. But there is a bar vis-à-vis and another one nearly beside the house. On Friday and Saturday both seem to be opened until 4 am. Although I used ear plugs, I woke up a few times during these nights until 4. On the other nights it was absolutely no problem and the noise level from the bars was low. \r\n\r\nOn the whole I would return – but maybe not on a Friday and Saturday.

I am a keen runner and ended up going for long runs down the Hudson shore (just at the bottom of Leroy Street) almost every day because it was so perfect.

It was great to have my own bedroom and bathroom space, but I also appreciated that she was there if I had needed her for anything (not that I did, but you just never know!)  She's a very interesting person and she struck just the right note in being there as a host, but also letting me do my own thing.  \r\n\r\nhe bedroom is quite large for a NYC place, but still, it's NYC and the W Village, so anyone travelling from out of town needs to keep in mind.

It was nice to just walking around the area which is designated as historic on one plaque I saw.\r\n"},{"_id":"100679015","date":{"$date":"2016-09-10T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1656539","reviewer_id":"92884238","reviewer_name":"Jordan","comments":"Ann was an incredible host with a beautiful home...within 5 mins' walk of everywhere I wanted to go in Greenwich Village, and only half an hour's walk from Penn Station.

The real problem is that I had explicitly asked Ann if I could leave my luggage until time for my late plane and she replied yes upon reservation; but it had become no by the time I arrived, without any advance notice. The reason is that Ann had a chance to rent her full appartment to a family, it would earn her a lot of money, and the arrangement we had seemed to not matter anymore. Wake-up on Sunday morning was 8:30 am because the maid had to clean the whole appartment and I was asked to leave my room by 10:00. Much of this would have been acceptable if stated and agreed in advance.

If you like both having the beach nearby and a wide range of eating options, this is the perfect place.

We found the house was welcoming, spacious and well-divided to accomodate our large group. Aida \u0026 Francisco kindly provided us with a crib and high-chair for the baby. They were also very helpful in showing the house and giving indications about Porto.\n\nThe three bathrooms, the large living room and the gorgeous terasse made \"their home in porto\" most practical and convenient. It is fully-furnished, charmly decorated, and it has everything (and beyond) one can expect from a complete house. The dining room and kitchen are small, so we spent most of our days in the warm living rooom or, when weather permits, on the outdoor patio.\n\nThe location is residential but slightly remote from the center. Two metro stations are about 12-15min walk, and the center is 25-30min walk. It is therefore better serviced by bus. \n \nThere are plenty of services around the home area (groceries, bakery, restaurants). It is mostly quiet at night, except the large front bedroom, which gives on the intersection of two important streets and can be nosiy at night. \n\nIn the end, we found it was the perfect home for our two families in Porto. We highly recommend it."},{"_id":"178023699","date":{"$date":"2017-08-04T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16610404","reviewer_id":"16161615","reviewer_name":"Laura","comments":"Maison correspondant parfaitement à la description et aux photos, tres agréable à vivre.\nNous avons séjourné à 3 couples dans cette maison située à proximité de nombreuses commodités. \nUn grand merci à Aida et Francisco pour leur gentillesse et leur disponibilité.

The apartment is really close to the brt station, which is a good way to travel if you don't want to pay more for taxis. The taxis can be a bit pricy because this apartment is pretty far from the main attractions like Copacabana, Cristo, and Sugar Loaf Mountain. The only drawback from this place is the location away from the city center. It takes close to 45 minutes in a taxi and 1 hour and 30 minutes on a bus.

Viajamos com meu pai e minha mãe que são idosos e a televisão e um elemento essencial para a distração deles. Embora o Gustavo tenha respondido as msg e tenha se prontificado em pedir pra alguém ir até o apto para verificar o que estava ocorrendo, nada foi feito.

The entire apartment is lovely and it is directly near the train station. The value of the property is great. Unfortunately, just about every Airbnb rental does not allow you to have parties or any big events, including this apartment. However, this apartment complex has a pool and a place to grill out (where you can bring people) which really sets it apart from other Airbnb rentals. What really surprised me was the excellent hospitality. Jess is extremely trusting and nice because she would always help me out with any possible inconvenience that I encountered. For example, once I requested to stay one night less because of my financial budget since I am a broke college student. Jess said that's fine and asks if she can pay me electronically (for the night that I would not be staying), but I had to ask her if she could pay me in cash because I had zero in my bank account (It takes a few days to transfer) and I needed the money for food for that week (However, I didn't tell her that). I felt bad asking for the cash to be delivered because I knew she had to take care her 3 - week old baby but it was like essential. Without hesitation, she dropped off the money the next day in cash and she didn't know how much that helped me out. Also, they provide you with a pamphlet that lists places to eat nearby, they give you privacy, jess constantly responds to your text messages immediately, and they have the place refurbished with every possible necessity. You would think that they wouldn't care about you and your stay after you give them a down payment, but unlike most Airbnb's, they want you to have a great stay even after you pay. It's like staying at a hotel. I highly recommend this place in particular because I researched all of the possible Airbnb rentals for hours and this was by far the best-valued one that I could find."},{"_id":"229477052","date":{"$date":"2018-01-23T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16635022","reviewer_id":"117635043","reviewer_name":"Pavlos","comments":"It was an amazing place.

(Luggage may be deposited though earlier in the day). VERY IMPORTANT - STRICT CANCELLATION POLICY As this listing is for last minute and often same day bookings there is a strict cancellation policy in place. This means once you have booked your payment is not refundable upon cancellation. Once we confirm your booking request there is no refund if you change your mind or book other accommodation. There will always be a time lag between when you make your booking request and when it is accepted and confirmed - sometimes this is minuscule and we deal with your request almost instantaneously; other times, for other reasons, it may take considerably longer to get back to you.

Feel free to grab one of us if you want some local advice or history or philosophical discussions - similarly if you're here for a bit of a look around maybe we can lend a bit of a hand.

Sometimes for years at a stretch. Extreme tourist as defined by Wikipedia. In between times a performer and photographer and occasionally all of the above simultaneously as photojournalist or touring actor.\r\nI like to think I can tell great stories but I may be wrong...\r\n\r\nDuring my idle hours I enjoy backpacking through universities collecting degrees and living a full life of adventure, discovery and art so if your interests and/or qualifications run to theatre, literature, fine arts, art history or the law then you've a ready partner for intellectual discussion.\r\nA well stocked library is assured for convenient reference.\r\n\r\nAs you can probably tell I'm more than just a little bit xenophilic, enjoying the company of travellers, creative spirits and those just enjoying the freedom and discovery of the road.\r\n\r\nMy home is a sprawling quirkily evolving eclectic canvas; part tropical greenhouse and jungle, part improvisation workshop, part art studio, all of a slightly anarchic constantly changing composition. (I would never consider shopping at Ikea or watching any TV program involving adversarial reality and/or bogan house make overs, although I'm always enthralled and inspired by Kevin McCloud and Grand Designs.)\r\n\r\nMy place is a patchwork of sprawling, overgrown alternative comfortable anarchy.\r\nIf you insist on lovely suburban tidy townness, neatly trimmed herbaceous borders, minimalist generic and tediously `nice` hotel decor, or twee boutique pensions this may not be the place for you, but then again you probably should be reconsidering staying in and about Newtown on that criteria.\r\nOur fantastically artistic and creative surrounds are one of the funkiest hubs of Australia, a rare inner city island resounding with alternative anti-gentrification energy and and sans bourgeoisie vitality - we live here because we love the community and our home is emblematic of that.\r\nThe vast majority of those who chose to stay with us seem to love it that way.\r\n\r\nIn any case hopefully our genuine hospitality and relaxed easy welcome will allow you to overlook some rougher edges in evolution and allow us to reciprocate the marvelous generosity we've benefited from in our travels.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf you are a new Airbnb member, we have a few recommendations.\r\nThese three steps can be done by going to the main page after you login,\r\nclick on your name on the top menu for a drop down menu.\r\nSelect 'Edit Profile', and then:\r\n\r\n1.

The cabin is as Steven describes.  It is a short walk to the lower end of King Street, Newtown, and maintains the traditions of old Newtown.  Marrickville Metro (shopping centre) is very close too for supermarket shopping.  There is a lot of road construction going on at the moment, but Steven's place is a nice, retro haven away from the excesses of Sydney, yet close to the buzz of Newtown, St Peters station, and (as a result) many places connected via public transport.  Steven is the type of host you wish you had more time to spend chatting with.  It is a real 'airbnb' experience - living like a local - a Newtown local.  Steven isn't just someone making a buck, he's offering a local experience.  Steven describes the place honestly...if you want a sparkling Sydney harbour experience, look to the Eastern Suburbs of Sydney.  This is Newtown of old - and the better for that."},{"_id":"274696210","date":{"$date":"2018-06-10T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16651655","reviewer_id":"141040128","reviewer_name":"David","comments":"Wonderful spot!

Close to shops and buses which enable you to get into the city in around 20 minutes.  The ferry terminal is also close by.  \n\nThe accommodation is lovely and most importantly has a really comfortable bed with lovely pillows.  The wetroom was the highlight of the day which houses an amazing rainfall shower as well as attachments.  The hosts provide shower gel, shampoo, conditioner and gorgeous thick towels.  There was also an easy to use washing machine which again the liquid detergent is supplied.\n\nThe kitchen is small but very functional.  There is a fridge, microwave (which we didn't use), toaster, kettle and all the cutlery you will need.  Best of all there is a Nespresso machine and again pods are supplied but it might be a good idea to bring your own personal favorites.  \n\nThere is plenty of drawer and hanging space in the bedroom.  My only negative about this place is the smell of moth balls in the drawers and wardrobe.  There is also a safe in the wardrobe with an easy to remember code because it is the last 4 digits of your own phone number and this is also the case for the front door so no need to carry a key.\n\nWe would definitely stay here again as long as the hosts will have us back!"},{"_id":"234967997","date":{"$date":"2018-02-14T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16654584","reviewer_id":"17842361","reviewer_name":"Jane","comments":"We had a lovely two weeks here in February.

We enjoyed the apartment so much we didn't want to leave! \n\nThe neighbourhood was fabulous, the train station is only a 5 minute walk.

Prior to confirming booking Jae was very helpful and answered a number of questions about the apartment, the area and transport to Manhattan etc. He replied without delay. \nJae was really accommodating about my arrival time, and met me at the apartment.\nThe place is great. Recently refurbished so everything is brand new. It's a great space for two people - maybe four since there is a sofa bed in addition to the double bedroom. The apartment is bright with windows all round and two skylights for additional light and ventilation. AC worked well. \nI loved the local neighbourhood. Nice pub two minutes away (Duck Duck) and a couple of organic delis and an awesome bagel shop for breakfast and coffee (Bread Brothers). The L train station is 5 mins walk, and midtown Manhattan is about ten minutes on the train. I had to commute to the UN building and it took me 30 minutes door to door. \nJae was a great host. The apartment is family run so they have a vested interest in making it really welcoming. He even left beer in the fridge for me! Highly recommended.

It's also about 2 blocks away from the station, so that was convenient. But, if you're in the city walking around for the entire day and catch the subway back.. those 2 blocks can seem way longer lol.  Also, if you're a light sleeper or plan on taking naps during the day be aware that there is a raver downstairs. He/she likes to bump very loud edm music throughout the day/night. And yes it can be heard throughout the whole entire building.

We did not hear street noise. \n\nI highly recommend!"},{"_id":"203226506","date":{"$date":"2017-10-14T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1668328","reviewer_id":"21108683","reviewer_name":"Noelle","comments":"Clean place with a comfy bed and plenty nearby."},{"_id":"205249067","date":{"$date":"2017-10-21T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1668328","reviewer_id":"54240074","reviewer_name":"Sandra","comments":"Great location.

We were there during 90-100 degree weather so the two A/C window units couldn't quite keep up, but with one unit in the bedroom and an oscillating floor fan, we slept comfortably. Happy to have a coffee maker, toaster, microwave and enough basic cooking equipment so that we could make breakfast before heading out for the day. Good market just up the street for buying some essentials plus a corner convenience store/deli and pizza place right next door. Not a lot of good restaurants or bars in the immediate area but plenty of options just a short bus or cab/Uber ride away.

Also worth noting for the ones travelling during the winter that the flat doesn't have heating (which is clearly stated in the listing), however there were 3 duvets per person, so it wasn't an issue at night.

Unfortunately, the first night we stayed we killed several cockroaches inside the apartment. We killed a large one in the room between the two bedrooms, several small/baby ones in the kitchen, including in the utensil drawer, on the floor, and on the ceiling. Also, a medium sized cockroach got away inside the kitchen drawers. We all were very uncomfortable sleeping there that night. We had to find other accommodations for the next night. We communicated with the owner about the cockroach issue but he says it’s not his fault bugs come in from the outside. He also stated that he had pest control come a week ago. Unfortunately, that didn’t seem to do much for his apartment’s cleanliness, and then became our problem. We were not refunded any amount upon first reaching out to the owner and then also reaching out to Airbnb. My advice is take more pictures than I did. My initial thoughts when seeing a cockroach in the apartment was to kill it, in hindsight I should have taken pictures each time before killing them."},{"_id":"215305994","date":{"$date":"2017-11-29T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16708536","reviewer_id":"12656196","reviewer_name":"Andrew","comments":"Great location to manly night life"},{"_id":"217127273","date":{"$date":"2017-12-07T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16708536","reviewer_id":"20842306","reviewer_name":"Lesley","comments":"Great flat - 2 decent sized bedrooms, nice living room and well equipped kitchen and really great location.

You will see the amazing performance up close. A large sandpit next door with a huge grey silo in the middle vibrating and spewing out cement dust like a beautiful smoke machine. Enjoy watching the excavators, cement trucks and hard hat wearing performers as they do their thing. As you are so close to the action, the sound quality is excellent - it is very loud. You'll need to book soon as work has already started and this experience may only last until 2020.\n\nThe manager/owner of the apartment did not warn us about this exciting daily event happening next door. As you can imagine it was a wonderful surprise for our tired family and really lifted our spirits after a long flight, taxi and ferry ride!\n\nOn a serious note, you will want to get out of the apartment early each day and start exploring the beautiful area of Manly and other parts of Sydney. It was a real bonus to return each evening to find our apartment building was still standing, had stopped vibrating and the noise had ended.\n\nIf you are still reading and are seriously considering staying at this place then there's something wrong with you but please, read on. The sheets and towels seem clean but the cleaners would benefit from attending vacuum, sweeping and dusting courses. The key pickup location is not secure. The apartment was older but spacious with high ceilings and a few cracks in the walls (not sure if this was caused by the current earth works/construction work).\nGood times and memories that will last forever!"},{"_id":"243164724","date":{"$date":"2018-03-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16708536","reviewer_id":"9952755","reviewer_name":"Shari","comments":"Great place with a very convenient location to the Manly Ferry.

It’s a comfortable, clean two bed apartment with pretty much all the amenities you’d need. The location was perfect - very close to shops, restaurants, the Wharf (where you can catch the ferry to the city) and a short walk to the beach. \n\nThe street the apartment is on was quiet. There is major building works going on next door but it was on the side of the bathroom and kitchen so didn’t bother us too much. Parking on the street can be a bit tricky and as it’s a one way street you can find yourself going round in circles looking for a space.\n\nPaul was quick to respond to all my messages. I was hoping for a bit more flexibility with checking in and out times as we arrived very early to Sydney and had to leave late but there was no negotiating on this. Luckily we had friends in the city who helped us out on both days.\n\nOverall we had a pleasant stay. I would recommend the apartment if you want to stay in a laid back area of Sydney, close to a beach but still with good transportation into the city."},{"_id":"353843760","date":{"$date":"2018-11-29T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16708536","reviewer_id":"209687389","reviewer_name":"James","comments":"Very well located apartment.

Some of İstiklâl has a 19th century metropolitan character, and the avenue is lined with Neoclassical and Art Nouveau buildings.[citation needed] The nostalgic tram which runs on İstiklal Avenue, between Taksim Square and Tünel, was also re-installed in the early 1990s with the aim of reviving the historic atmosphere of the district. \r\nSome of the city's historic pubs and winehouses are located in the areas around İstiklal Avenue in Beyoğlu. The 19th century Çiçek Pasajı (literally Flower Passage in Turkish, or Cité de Péra in French, opened in 1876) on İstiklal Avenue can be described as a miniature version of the famous Galleria in Milan, Italy, and has rows of historic pubs, winehouses and restaurants","host_thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/5025972/profile_pic/1416934198/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","host_picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/5025972/profile_pic/1416934198/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","host_neighbourhood":"Taksim","host_is_superhost":false,"host_has_profile_pic":true,"host_identity_verified":false,"host_listings_count":3,"host_total_listings_count":3,"host_verifications":["email","phone","facebook","reviews"]},"address":{"street":"Istanbul, Istanbul Province, Turkey","suburb":"Taksim","government_area":"Beyoglu","market":"Istanbul","country":"Turkey","country_code":"TR","location":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[28.98113,41.03801],"is_location_exact":true}},"availability":{"availability_30":30,"availability_60":60,"availability_90":90,"availability_365":180},"review_scores":{"review_scores_accuracy":10,"review_scores_cleanliness":10,"review_scores_checkin":10,"review_scores_communication":10,"review_scores_location":8,"review_scores_value":10,"review_scores_rating":100},"reviews":[{"_id":"17821731","date":{"$date":"2014-08-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1676806","reviewer_id":"778585","reviewer_name":"Chloe","comments":"We were made to feel welcome.

Depois de tudo a semanas confirmado e aceito , depois de mensagens inbox sem retorno com a combinação de como pegaríamos a chave deste apartamento, somente um dia antes consegui me comunicar com o marido da anfitriã Elaine ( com a mesma nunca consegui falar). Ele nos disse que infelizmente o apartamento  design Leblon reservado não estava mais disponível e nos colocaria num apartamento próximo. Por se tratar de uma véspera de feriadão no Rio de Janeiro não tivemos outra alternativa a não ser aceitar o tal apartamento. Mesmo sendo o outro apartamento uma cobertura muito bem  localizado e maior  do que havíamos escolhido, se tratava de um imóvel em péssimas condições de manutenção! Lâmpadas queimadas, encardido, sujo, roupas de cama péssimas. Eletrodomésticos sem funcionar. Pedimos um simples plug para ligar o microondas e nem isso ele providenciou para a semana que passamos lá! Sempre escolhemos o imóvel não pelo tamanho e sim por quanto organizado, limpo e cuidado seja. \r\nO anfitrião não teve o cuidado de checar as condições do imóvel antes de nossa chegada, e foi muito desatento e negligente no retorno de solicitações.\r\nJá utilizamos o AirBnB em varias partes do mundo, tenho ótima reputação com todos os anfitriões que passei, mas experiência como essa nunca havia tido! Talvez seja por que o anfitrião não seja dono do imóvel, é uma agencia/operadora de turismo terceirizando locação com vários apartamentos e não tenha o controle do que esta fazendo! \r\nSugiro que futuros interessados fiquem atentos pois uma experiência como essa pode estragar uma programação de férias!

O wifi funciona bem, tem ar condicionado em todos os ambientes. O contato com a Elaine e com seu marido, que administraram a locação foi mínimo, mas o necessário. Quando cheguei lá a chave já estava na portaria. \nAo meu ver, o único ponto negativo é que a geladeira não estava funcionando. O que impediu que eu fizesse compras maiores para armazenar.

The wifi is shared with the next door apartment through a wifi extender, and there were some instances in which it was less than reliable.

I rented it for a week because it seemed nice in pictures. While the location is perfect (everything is, indeed, close-by), the apartment needs significant updates.\n1) Wifi works from 8 in the morning until 18. Despite reporting the issue to Andre and his attempts to repair it, nothing was done neither on the same day, nor on the following. Honestly, I had a better internet when I was in a poor neighborhood of Mexican suburbs. Absolutely ridiculous for downtown Montreal.\n2) Bathrooms are just not-appealing. Yes, they work - but I felt disgusting taking shower there. No soap - even to wash hands!\n3) Cleaning was barely done. Floors are dirty (you can see it on your feet when walking - they become dark in 10 steps!). Dishes not washed. Cups are dirty.\n4) The entrance to the apartment is actually really sketchy. The cafe on the first floor is so bizarre, my fiance was literally afraid to walk in the building! Plus the amount of garbage on the street in front. Moreover, once on the stairs, the light barely works - really dangerous to go down. Forget it if you have problems with mobility.\n5) Everything in the apartment is from the cheapest section of ikea. Literally everything. In one room there is even no bed, just a mattress on the floor. Not that the furniture/towels are bad, they can hardly be re-used for long periods of time.\n6) As windows go to garbage bins and a hotel, one morning I was woken up at 6 am by a trash-collector cars - it was really loud and long (approximately 30 minutes).\n\nBriefly, 3 stars are basically given for the location of the apartment, I would never consider staying in it again, and I definitely do not recommend it to anyone, unless you do not mind sleeping in a sketchy place with dirty showers and kitchen."},{"_id":"157787736","date":{"$date":"2017-06-04T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16777953","reviewer_id":"97844812","reviewer_name":"Matthew","comments":"Andre's apartment was just what we needed for a guys trip to Montreal, location was perfect, right beside a couple pubs and 3 brasseurs.

Overall, combining the location and price, still very recommended this place for group of people to experiencing MTL!"},{"_id":"163101484","date":{"$date":"2017-06-23T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16777953","reviewer_id":"101507360","reviewer_name":"Ahmed","comments":"Place wasn't very clean, location is good.

Ele e seu pai nos receberam na estação de trens( comboios para os portugueses) e nos levaram ao apartamento, enquanto conversavam conosco e davam dicas dos lugares no nosso entorno e por onde passávamos. O apartamento é como descrito nas fotos, os espaços são muito bons e possui uma varanda nos fundos com gazebo e uma churrasqueira a gás( muito fácil de usar). É importante dizer que por estar situado no subsolo( cave) há um lance de escadas para descer. O elevador não vai até lá. Não era problema para o nosso grupo, mas se houverem problemas de mobilidade talvez não seja a melhor opção. A localização é muito boa. Há mercados, padarias e restaurantes próximos. É muito fácil ir a pé até o centro da cidade. Recomendo a padaria Silva e Correia para o café da manhã, fica na Rua Moreira, na quadra em frente ao apartamento. Lugar simples, com bom atendimento e muita qualidade. Então faça uma compração com as nossas.

They're genuinely nice, hospitable people who truly care about making their guests' stay enjoyable. I'm a light sleeper and despite the assorted noises (frogs, roosters etc.), I had no problem falling asleep and sleeping undisturbed throughout the night.

The place was very nice with great amenities. It was private and had a yard around it you could enjoy (along with a lava tube in the back!). Our 8 year old really enjoyed looking around for Geckos and playing around the lava tube. It also had a nice covered lanai with relaxing seats, a hammock, an outdoor bar/sink, and a good sized grill. Inside was very nice and clean and had all the amenities we could want. We felt like we were staying at home here. Fans in every room with remote controls so you had the controls anywhere you needed. The things they had here were great quality (pots/pans, oven, washer/dryer,shower, tv/cable, etc.) and not cheap like other places we stayed at. I thought the location was going to be an issue because it was outside of Hilo, but I was actually happy we stayed here because it was more central to the different places we were exploring while on the Hilo side. The house shares a driveway with the Host’s parents house, who were so nice and informative about different places to explore while here. Even tho you share a driveway, you still have complete privacy so don’t worry about that. Overall we give it two big thumbs up.

We didn't drive at all in O'ahu, but everything worked out for us - there is a bus stop close by and we quickly figured out the bus routes.

If anyone has a question about beaches or local food places he will suggest some great ones. He responds extremely quick online to any questions you might have before you arrive, which surprised me as I visited from Hungary which is 12hours difference!!\n\nThey both work long hours, so their home is basically all yours. You really only meet them for a few minutes in the evening when they get home from work. \n\n2 lovely spacious bedrooms are available and perfect for a family of 4. Clean, spacious bathroom - do ask about how to change to shower, I got a little confused!!! - and a huge diner/living area/kitchen at the front. The back yard is cute, tho it rains a bit pretty much every morning and evening so we didn't really use it. \n\nLocation is perfect, there are buses around but I would 100% recommend renting a car - just so much easier to get round the island. Bus takes forever to get to Waikiki or Kailua even, and let's not talk about the North Shore...There are supermarkets nearby, closest is Times Supermarket, but Windward Mall is pretty close too, only a few junctions away. \n\nOverall I couldn't have chosen a better place to stay with my family.\n\nMahalo Eric!"},{"_id":"303191713","date":{"$date":"2018-08-06T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16818131","reviewer_id":"197574930","reviewer_name":"Harry","comments":"The location of the home is in a quiet neighborhood.

Plenty of buses to take you into town. Quiet hood close to CBD with a clear hip factor but not trendy. Great communication with very nice property manager. Super clean. Only complaints would be the hard pillows (we both got stiff necks), slippery bathtub (but it’s a great size!), no bedroom door so not private if anyone’s downstairs (the stairs lead up to an open bedroom), great heat but rises up to the bedroom so if you want to warm up the downstairs it gets really hot in the bedroom (hard to balance the two), they’ve covered the bedroom window with a nice shade but it doesn’t cover the awkwardly shaped diagonal window so light comes in at one corner (we covered that spot with a pillow). Overall a good stay but does have its small quirks."}]}

Ben's place came stocked with soap, shampoo, toilet paper, towels, a hair dyer, and even an ironing machine. The free parking is extremely convenient for guests driving to Montreal; however, I do caution those with taller vehicles (like raised trucks) since the ceiling of the garage leading to the outdoor lot didn't seem that spacious in height. We were able to park and leave our car in the same spot for the entire duration of our trip while relying on the metro station that is one block away to get around the city. Ben's place is also conveniently located two blocks away from Sainte Catherine Street which has a great variety of shops and restaurants all within walking distance.

It would've been nice to have a little more than an old dish towel in the bathroom to dry our hands, let alone a couple of actual bath towels. The building itself was the real problem, dingy and run down would be the most charitable way to describe it. Falling down construction foam wrap in the elevator, plastic sheeting covering the carpet in the hallway. Not a good look. \nBut for us, the real clinker was when we got there, plastered all over the doors and walls were signs saying the water was going to be turned off from 9:00AM-5:00PM. Totally unacceptable. The signs were posted the day before, and our host should have known and informed us of this. His response was \"It's not my fault!!\" And yes, that is his actual quote.not something I ever wanted to hear from my kids, an definitely not a response I want from a host.  I called Airbnb, cancelled our next day, and thankfully, was able to get a full refund. \n\nIf you're looking for a budget place to stay, this might be ok as long as there are no other problems with the building.

The parking is the selling point of this airbnb. If you are traveling alone with a car, you may have to double park for a few minutes while you run up and grab the garage keys and return to your car. Unfortunately, the hallway leading up to the apartment reeked of cigarette smoke 24-7.

Ben was very responsive and provided clear, detailed instructions for check in/check out, parking and the building amenities. The apartment is close to shops, restaurants and public transportation. It’s also within walking distance of the biggest park in Montreal (Mont-Royal), which was a bonus. The neighborhood seemed safe; however, it is very noisy on the weekends!  It seems like many college students live in this area, which is fine, but they can be extremely noisy in the building, hallways and on the street until the wee hours.  The walls and windows in the building didn’t seem to be very insulated, so there was also a great deal of very loud street noise (cars, motorcycles, trucks, people shouting, etc.)\n\nThe apartment itself is no-frills, but it suited our purposes for a few days.  Since we stayed in the summer, we especially appreciated the air conditioning.  The bathroom needs a little TLC, but was functional.  I believe the bed was listed as a queen-size, but I think it’s one of the Ikea brand full/queen beds, and it definitely didn’t seem as large as our queen-sized bed at home.  The kitchen was well-stocked with dishes, glasses, etc., and has a full-size refrigerator. Like other reviewers mentioned, we experienced the smell of smoke in the hallway outside the apartment, but had no problem inside the flat itself.  The elevators worked well and were big enough for my husband’s mountain bike. Overall, the free parking and the location of this apartment outweighed the noise and the lack of fancy amenities.  I would recommend Ben’s apartment.

The suite was not clean. The bathroom was the worst. The sink didn't drain well and had a terrible smell, the bath mat had hair and nail clippings in it. The shower curtain was brown at the bottom from not being cleaned. The plug to the tub was completely brown and disgusting. Bathing was out of the question. There was two very small toliet papers left that made us have to go purchase more along with soap. The baseboard through out the suite are thick with dust. The kitchen had a dirty stove and fridge. The kitchen is not equiped with the essentials if a person wanted to cook. No cookies sheets for example hardly any utensils. The couch is not comfortable and it had crumbs on it when we arrived. It is listed there are candles but they were completely burnt and the lighter did not work. We purchased our own because the suite bathroom sink had that bad smell. I will say Ben was good with communication and clear with details how to get into the suite. I think this suite has great potential if it was cleaned.

The hallway smells strongly of smoke amongst other things. The drinking glasses were broken. The furniture was rather cheap and extremely basic. The balcony had trash and cigarette buds strewn on it.

In retrospect, we should have known there would be some compromises. The building is not so nice once you get past the lobby. The elevators and hallways often smelled of cigarettes and generally didn't seem very clean. The apartment itself was dark and had a slightly musty smell. It was clean except for some crumbs on the floor and couch, and the bedding which didn't look like it had been washed. We asked for it to be replaced, though, and Ben took care of it quickly while we were out for dinner.

They do not change it. And the whole bed and sheets had odours of sweat, some body smell and on top of those \"reach\" smells the cover of some deodorant of perfume - it might be used instead of washing the sheets or it might be just additional flowering from the previous dozens of clients. \n\nSo why 1 point? Because this is apparently a \"tradition\" at this place not to change sheets and not to hear the customers - the same issue was already addressed in the comments and here we are at the same point and nothing was done.\nFinding it as a real disrespectful attitudes towards the clients, especially when the same issue was already addressed by other people, but the owner still kept the same \"tradition\" not to change the sheets. \nAnd in addition, same place charged me 49 CAD for cleaning fees when the cost of the place per night was 31 CAD. So it is 61.25% of the whole price for cleaning. I think they could take 3$ for the sheet's washing from those 49CAD, but they didn't.. \n--\n*Additional thing to keep in mind, that the apartment is in the centre of Montreal and the windows are not really built with good sound isolation, so you might hear all the sounds of the street even during the night. \n\nHope the review will change the attitude of the owner towards his customers ."},{"_id":"408094157","date":{"$date":"2019-02-03T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16845784","reviewer_id":"208272416","reviewer_name":"Dave","comments":"Ben A flat was quiet and secure with the Metro near by.

Sultanahmet and the main tourist sites are a short tram ride away. Despite being in the heart of the action, the apartment was relatively quiet. Esra provided clear instructions, a map and pictures before we arrived and self check-in and check-out were a breeze. The apartment was very clean, in good condition, and very spacious for 2 adults with high ceilings. Fresh linens, a large collection of DVDs (for lazy evenings) and a small pantry were much appreciated. Be aware that you'd have to climb 2 steep floors on a narrow staircase, so go light on the luggage. Finally, the only downside: the generator/heater in the bedroom was very loud and turned on/off constantly, so light sleepers beware.

Cars are honking, NYPD traffic officers blowing their whistles. Not to mention the host has roommates who live with her - it was just very awkward and uncomfortable staying the night with complete strangers. I didn't feel safe and I was afraid to leave my luggage and possessions unattended in the room. Other than that the room is big to accommodate 3 guests. The room is dusty and the floors are dirty. If you ever stay here make sure to take a pair of slippers and shower shoes. I wouldn't recommend this place. I will never go back especially for $200 for one night. NOT WORTH IT!

There's enough space to play games in the garden, swimming is always an option and the indoor space is open plan so it's easy to keep an eye on everyone!","host_response_time":"within an hour","host_thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/65daacb4-479b-4140-bc01-5eb741c51652.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","host_picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/65daacb4-479b-4140-bc01-5eb741c51652.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","host_neighbourhood":"","host_response_rate":100,"host_is_superhost":false,"host_has_profile_pic":true,"host_identity_verified":true,"host_listings_count":1,"host_total_listings_count":1,"host_verifications":["email","phone","reviews","jumio","offline_government_id","government_id"]},"address":{"street":"Saint Ives, NSW, Australia","suburb":"","government_area":"Ku-Ring-Gai","market":"Sydney","country":"Australia","country_code":"AU","location":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[151.17179,-33.75039],"is_location_exact":true}},"availability":{"availability_30":0,"availability_60":15,"availability_90":15,"availability_365":100},"review_scores":{"review_scores_accuracy":10,"review_scores_cleanliness":9,"review_scores_checkin":10,"review_scores_communication":10,"review_scores_location":10,"review_scores_value":10,"review_scores_rating":100},"reviews":[{"_id":"194980560","date":{"$date":"2017-09-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16885508","reviewer_id":"129815824","reviewer_name":"Shirley","comments":"Great place for a family group to stay.

We also appreciated the  well-stocked kitchen which had lots of crockery, cutlery and food-prep equipment. The lounge room chairs were ultra-comfortable.

Although I did not meet Philippe (but I did speak with him over the phone (very nice guy)) I did meet Sandra who was very lovely. She gave my brother and I a tour of the place and also made sure that where we were parked for our stay would be a good place to park to avoid parking tickets. Within the house they provided a nice little manual that they drew up. It had a nice map with near by restaurants, grocery stores and public transportation and also instructions on how to use the tv and a listing of some of the more used channels so you didn't have to go searching for them as well as information for connecting to the wifi. There were some basic cooking supplies (pots, cutlery and such) which was nice as that meant that we didn't have to eat out every night. The area was very nice, and just a few minutes walk away from a very nice park, bike rental station and swimming pool and about a 10-15 minute walk to the Metro. From their place to Rue Sherbrooke and St. Laurent (where they had many festivities for the Grand Prix Weekend) cost my brother and I about $11 for the taxi ride. All in all, the place is nice though it is a bit small, especially the bathroom. However, the 2 bedrooms that were there were a good size and didn't feel cramped at all.

There were good places to eat right down the street, and plenty of other good things to do a short Uber ride away. My only issue was that the wifi was really slow and inconsistent. I keep just using my phone data in order to access maps and stuff to plan our outings. If I had had work to do and was relying on the wifi to send emails with attachments, it would have been very frustrating. Also, the bathroom is very small - there is almost no leg room in from of the toilet. Aside from those two things though, everything was great.

It was also great not to have to worry about carrying around keys! The apartment is within walking distance (right down the block) to a grocery store, liquor store, pharmacy as well as some restaurants and coffee shops and is also not a far walk to more options on Avenue du Mont-Royal. There is a bus stop right at the corner beside the apartment, but it is a bit longer of a walk to the metro (around 15 minutes). Just a note that the bed is a little on the firmer side, but that might just personal preference. Apartment comes with all the basics you’ll need.

Close by are small shops, restaurants, pharmacy, bakery, convenience store and wine shop. Close to public transportation, this is a must if you don’t want to drive all the time, or pay for parking in downtown Sydney (expensive). We didn’t see the host, but we had no problems communicating with him. Any questions we had were quickly answered. We had the apartment to ourselves, and the place was nicely decorated. Having a parking spot was nice. Street parking is available, although you usually didn’t get a spot close to the house, so having a reserved parking spot (in the back of the building) was a great benefit.\n\nRose Bay is suburb east of Sydney, but by using the Sydney Ferry (get an Opal card) you get to cruise on the water to downtown Sydney with amazing views of Sydney Harbor all the way. Ten minute walk to the Ferry, and a fifteen minute cruise. Within a half hour, you’re in downtown Sydney by the Opera House, Harbor Bridge, Royal Botanic Gardens, etc.  You can also use the bus/train, to travel downtown (~45 minutes), but why bother when you can see Sydney from the harbor.

You can't hear any noise. \nContacting with Juliette was very convenient. She was very prompt with replies, informative with what's around the area, and had clear guidelines. \nThe only thing that brought up some concerns was that  one of our friends in hk came over to visit and passed out on the couch after a long night of going out in lkf which wasn't our plan. We apologize for this and inviting someone over if that was not allowed. I am not sure how she found this out but we just assumed the first floor cafe workers are her relatives. haha \nOverall, Juliette's apt is the \"it-place\" if you're looking for both HK actions right in the center of the city and peaceful serene sleep. Bed was big and comfortable and bathroom was clean. Though we didn't have any toilet paper (which took us 30 minutes looking for a store that sells tp rolls - turns out it's very close from the apt) or hot water for 3 days, we still recommend Juliette's apt. REALLY. It didn't bother us so much so we didn't inform Juliette, and I'm sure if you inform her she'll get right down to have it fixed for you. \nOne thing to be careful though! Be aware of the very dark and narrow staircase (especially if you had some fun night out). \n\nThis was my first airbnb experience and was quite fun. Thank you very much Juliette.

Located on top of our favourite restaurant and only five minute walks to great places like chom chom, feather boa, iron fairies, oddies foodies etc. The location itself makes it worth your money. The apt is clean but a bit cluttered. The sheets had some suspicious stains and the towels were a bit worn out but It’s really ok for the price we paid. If you’re picky with linen and such just bring your own it’s no big deal. The apartment is spacious and has all amenities you could need like well functioning WiFi, ok aircon and hot water. WILL DEFINITELY stay here next time in Hong Kong!! Super good value for money!

Can walk to many shops, restaurants, bars etc... can't get any better when it comes to location.\n\nI felt kind of cheated when I viewed pics of the tv in the ads for the apt, but the tv did not work. Tried to contact host and she never responded. Also, the air conditioning isn't the best.... left the apt very humid. The apartment would be sooo much better if cleaned up and in cluttered... hard to walk on stairs with all the stuff in the way. \n\nThis place has a lot of potential. Can't beat the location for the price!"},{"_id":"262723011","date":{"$date":"2018-05-10T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16920079","reviewer_id":"168709999","reviewer_name":"Michelle","comments":"Awesome location in vibrant, upmarket neighbourhood and close to mid-level escalators. Unbeatable value for money in this part of the city! The apartment was very comfortable  and spacious by Hong Kong standards, but can be a little noisy on some nights, which is the flipside of being close to popular bars and restaurants. Only slight disappointment was that the wifi was quite slow and dropped occasionally (probably not too much of an issue unless you need to keep on top of your work while away). Overall, we loved our stay and will definitely choose this apartment when back in Hong Kong!"},{"_id":"267019620","date":{"$date":"2018-05-21T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16920079","reviewer_id":"40161","reviewer_name":"Paul","comments":"Victoria's place is awesome.
