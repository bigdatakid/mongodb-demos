Perfecto para cuatro o seis personas con sus dos habitaciones y sofá cama y sus dos baños. Eso sí, uno de los dormitorios está suspendido sobre el salón  por lo que si quieres privacidad o con quien compartes el apartamento ve la tele o tiene encendida la luz y eso te molesta, es un inconveniente. Sin embargo, en mi opinión, es ese dormitorio suspendido sobre el salón lo que le da un encanto especial y es algo que solo una casa antigua con techos abuhardillados, permite. Es un diseño ingenioso que a mí me ha encantado. La única pega, que es un cuarto sin ascensor pero después de las cuestas que hay que subir en Oporto, es una cuesta más, sin más. Además al ser un edificio antiguo, es un encanto más subir una escalera con historia. El apartamento está en pleno centro. La torre de los Clérigos se te cae encima de lo cerca que esta. Al lado, la librería Lello e Irmao, la estación Sao Bento... es una ubicación estupenda, con un parking al lado.... El anfitrión muy atento, nos ha resuelto todas las dudas y nos ha dado buenos consejos. Oporto nos ha encantado y sin ninguna duda, si volvemos nos alojaremos de nuevo en este apartamento. Además de su privilegiada ubicación y su especial diseño, el alojarse en un apartamento con arraigo, sin duda tiene un plus."},{"_id":"218207979","date":{"$date":"2017-12-11T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18607563","reviewer_id":"16916370","reviewer_name":"Olga","comments":"We spend 2 night in the Manuel’s apartment and it was great.

The loft bedrooms are such lovely spaces and the added bonus of two bathrooms with teenage kids certainly made our stay even more relaxing! The beds and pillows were super-comfy and from the apartment’s location, we were able to walk everywhere! We parked our car in the nearby carpark and didn’t return to it until the end of our Porto holiday. \nThe only thing that we feel we should mention is that late at night (and early morning) the noise from the busy local streets can be heard. This is especially the case as the apartment is located near the bar areas - I guess being so centrally located is a bit of a double edged sword. Once we adjusted to the noise, we were absolutely fine - but if you’re a light sleeper, this may pose as a problem. \nWe loved the aesthetic of Manuel’s apartment and our stay in beautiful Porto was wonderful.

It's very clean and the kitchen is equipped with all necessary amenities. The location is great, because all main attractions are within a 15 minute walk. All perfect, if it wasn't for the room temperature and the noise coming from the street. In the apartment there's no heating, but just A/C, which may be good in the summer but not in the winter. If you want the living room not to be too cold you have to switch the air conditioner on, but if you do the bedrooms will get too hot. It's not easy to find the right balance, so you'll either be too cold downstairs or too hot upstairs. What makes things worse however is the noise coming from the street. When I read the many reviews about this I thought \"Come on, it can't be that bad\"... Yes, it can! People in Porto seem never to be sleeping. From the apartment you can hear people screeming and shouting, playing very loud music and car horns all night long. Even if you accidentally manage to fall asleep, you'll be waken up repeatedly during the night. If I put together all the short fractions of sleep we managed to get, we probably slept 1 night out of 3. On check-out day we were just happy to leave, looking forward to getting some rest somewhere else!\nAs for the host, we never got to meet him, but he sent us very detailed explanations about self check-in and some tips on things to see and to do."},{"_id":"363229979","date":{"$date":"2018-12-28T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18607563","reviewer_id":"40629343","reviewer_name":"Rose","comments":"Great place.

The house has everything you need to feel at home while away from home. There is plenty of equipment to cook up a meal and even laundry machines for your use. There are many great places within walking distance including eateries, shops and a great wine store. Its easy to get to the beach and to the city within a short period of time from the cottage. The cottage is cosy, and I think its notable that only one of the three bedrooms, has a door that closes. Lastly, as mentioned in another review the stairs are very narrow to get to the second and third floor, so be aware of you physical capabilities when staying here. We enjoyed our trip to Sydney very much."},{"_id":"219563238","date":{"$date":"2017-12-18T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18616850","reviewer_id":"14489650","reviewer_name":"Nisa","comments":"Loved loved loved staying here.

The local theatre had some amazing performances so we did not need to venture far.  Local eateries were of a high standard, although we were glad to find the local Aldi in North Sydney to help out with budget constraints!

It is clean, nicely furnished and decorated, has a well equipped kitchen and is  located in a quiet area of north Sydney.  It is in an oldish block and is as described on the air bnb site, except for  parking. On phoning the agent to arrange a time to be met at the apartment, we were advised there had recently been difficulties with other residents parking in space 42. So, surprise, surprise when we arrived, yes there was a car in space 42. The agent insisted we park in space 43 instead which belonged to another apartment that sydney holiday rentals also manage.  This was not a full size spot and we had great difficulty fitting our Subaru into the spot. After scraping the side of the car on the adjacent concrete pillar it was obvious this spot was next to useless for all but micro cars. After asking the agent 3 times to contact the building manager in order to locate the owner of the car in spot 42 ( which was a standard sized spot) she very reluctantly went away and made a phone call. Miraculously, the owner materialised within less than 5 minutes and begrudgingly moved her ‘illegally’ parked car.  The agent’s insistence we park elsewhere on the property and her resistance to call the building manger, made us wonder whether apartment 42 does not, despite the literature provided for arrival and the advertising, actually come with parking space 42. So, if you need parking, we suggest you find another apartment.\n\nAt no point did the agent apologise, either for not being able to deliver on the parking space, nor for arriving 30 minutes late to meet us at the department despite insisting we arrive no later than 4.00.  \n\nUnfortunately this experience spoilt our stay."},{"_id":"348947635","date":{"$date":"2018-11-15T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18620288","reviewer_id":"211363677","reviewer_name":"Wolfgang","comments":"Auf Grund der Lage, Ausstattung und Ausblick unbedingt empfehlenswert"},{"_id":"352197362","date":{"$date":"2018-11-25T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18620288","reviewer_id":"55050568","reviewer_name":"Mel","comments":"This sunny one bed apartment is in a fabulous location ."},{"_id":"353849398","date":{"$date":"2018-11-29T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18620288","reviewer_id":"9650571","reviewer_name":"Karishma","comments":"Stephen was prompt with his responses, and even offered us suggestions for a rainy day.

Getting to and from the city centre of Porto takes some time. There are several buslines (and a historic tram) but one has to be patient. A rented bike is usefull, for exploring the coast or riding along the river (Vueguini rental).

The location was spectacular - literally less than 5 minutes walk from Place d'Arms Metro station (orange line) and less than 10 minutes walk from Place d'Arts Metro station (green line). This made it so so easy to see different parts of the city via the Metro and our trip experience was definitely heightened by this. From midway up the building you have an amazing  view of both Old Montreal and the Musée des Arts. The balcony is the perfect size for two people to sit and have their morning coffee. The unit was clean, the linens crisp and it was equipped with air conditioning, which was a welcome relief from the 32 degree Celsius weather outside. You have access to a gym, pool and terrasse that also has a beautiful view. Mike's assistant Vincent was extremely patient with us after we arrived later than anticipated due to road construction. He gave us great tips about the city and the immediate vicinity which helped us plan our week. Overall, the location, stunning view and well laid-out unit made this trip a 10/10.

What a lifesaver! We only got to meet briefly at check-in as he was about to go on a trip of his own, but he was delightful and made us feel very welcomed and we were always able to reach him thru the app with any questions/concerns. My daughter and I loved the location because it's right next to Champs Diner and around the corner from Dun-well Doughnuts, two of my daughter's favorite vegan eateries! We had breakfast at Champs before heading into the city each day, so convenient and delicious! The L train is also right around the corner and it's a fairly quick ride into Manhattan. We were able to get almost everywhere we wanted with only 1 train transfer (including to Yankee Stadium, the theater district and Greenwich Village). The apartment itself is very spacious! It's located on the 3rd floor. The stairs were a little hard for me at the end of the day, but I'm in my 60s now so I'm sure they would be fine for younger/ more athletic people. My 34yo daughter had no trouble with them. There is a very friendly cat named Squiggles that lives here. She sleeps a lot during the day, but sometimes \"sings\" during the night. It didn't bother us, but if you're a light sleeper maybe use ear plugs. Kung did make us aware of this before we arrived so it wasn't a surprise. The bed was big \u0026 comfy and Squiggles even came in to sleep with us for part of the night. (My daughter left the door open, hoping the cat would come in. You can leave the bedroom door shut if you want to keep her out). Kung's roommate was staying in the other bedroom during our stay. We barely saw each other, but she was very nice when we did. One of the only issues we had was it was pretty hot \u0026 stuffy the first night, but Kung asked us the next morning how our stay was and then told us how to operate the central fan/air so our 2nd night would be more comfortable. Also, the kitchen was pretty messy and the floors needed a good sweep, but like I said in the beginning, we booked the day before and Kung was going out of town so they probably thought they weren't going to have guests that week. It wasn't a big deal for us anyway. Overall, my daughter \u0026 I had a really great stay and would definitely stay here again! Highly recommend. Thanks Kung (\u0026 Squiggles) for your hospitality!"},{"_id":"203776770","date":{"$date":"2017-10-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18704012","reviewer_id":"28652769","reviewer_name":"Lukas","comments":"Stayed in Kung's spot for a weekend in NYC.

The apartment are on the top floor (but don't worry there is an elevator!) and this location provides beautiful views of the city and included a large terrace (perfect for breakfast or dinner). The apartment was well set up, had everything we needed and very clean and nice. Miguel also printed out my boarding pass and slid it under the door and was flexible with a late check out as well where we gave the keys to his mom who lives in the building (so convenient).

La nevera es pequeña y el agua caliente para bañarse alcanza para una persona.\nTiene una terraza bellisima para desayunar."},{"_id":"233351743","date":{"$date":"2018-02-09T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18769857","reviewer_id":"55961583","reviewer_name":"André","comments":"Very pleasent stay!

Miguel responds quickly to any requests or questions and his parents live in the building if you need anything. If there were any issues with the shower previously they have been rectified as there was lots of hot water and it worked just fine.  Enjoy a morning coffee or evening glass of wine on the sunny upper balcony with a view over Porto.

Alfredo was such a gracious host - from meeting me at the subway and giving me a tour of the neighborhood on the way to the apartment to making sure I felt welcomed and at home in his place - one of the best I've had. He had beautiful fresh flowers from the market around the house, some amazing yogurt in the fridge to start the day (have to find this back home) and even had a personalized map to welcome me to the neighborhood.  \nThe location is absolutely perfect. The apartment itself is nestled between some of the city's top rated restaurants and shops. The canal is situated right at the end of the block for the perfect after super stroll. There is a market about two blocks away that was just about perfect in every way. \nThe neighborhood shops and their keepers really made it feel like a neighborhood - one that I wish I had had more time to spend in.\nI would highly recommend this place and I'm hoping I can visit again soon.

The place was a complete delight. Clean, comfortable, centrally located right by AtWater and just 5 minutes from the Metro station. Lots of cool bars and restaurants right down stairs, even a natural store and pharmacy. The bed and shower were comfortable, enjoyed everything about this place! When we checked out Alfredo came to see us out, once again insisted on helping with the luggage and was fun to chat with for a few minutes until our Uber got there. We are Airbnb super hosts and feel like Alfredo inspired us to be even better by adding his own personal touch and lots of thought into his hosting. We recommend staying with him highly!!!

Alfredo was a fantastic host and very accommodating. He was there on arrival with everything we needed (including some macaroons and beer in the fridge!). Gorgeous apartment, very spacious and clean. The neighbourhood was fantastic with countless bars and restaurant and close to the canal, market and the metro. We walked into the city some days and took the metro others but either way, fabulous location without having to be too into the city to not have the pleasure of seeing the canal etc. Our flight time was changed last minute and Alfredo was very accommodating in allowing us to leave our luggage at the apartment. He was super quick in responding and catered to our every need. I can't recommend this listing enough.

When I arrived at the unit, I let myself in with a key from a lock box and Alfredo arrived 30 minutes later to introduce himself and provide information about the unit.  He graciously supplied a case of water and a much appreciated bottle of craft Quebec beer.  \n\nThe unit itself is in a safe and thriving neighbourhood about a 5 minute walk from the Atwater Market.  The entrance to the unit is through a locked door at street level and up a flight of stairs to the front door.  Inside, the unit is very spacious and bright, with windows that face the street.  The living room and kitchen is on the first level and the bedroom, washroom and laundry facilities are on the second level.  \n\nThe unit is stylishly decorated and furbished, with a strong wifi signal throughout.  There is a long sofa facing a top class entertainment system which I didn't have time to use. The kitchen area is roomy and has a dining table.. Although I just made coffee in the mornings with the cream and ground coffee supplied by Alfredo, there are plates, cutlery and utensils for those planning to cook their own meals.\n\nI had a comfortable sleep on the king sized bed and the black out shades kept the room completely dark when I slept in in the mornings.  The bathroom is well stocked with toiletries and the shower has excellent pressure with lots of hot water.  \n\nAll in all, the apartment completely met my expectations and I would certainly consider renting it again the next time I'm in Montreal."},{"_id":"195226192","date":{"$date":"2017-09-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18776184","reviewer_id":"127059634","reviewer_name":"Giovanni","comments":"Siamo stati bene, casa con ogni confort e in un punto strategico vicino ad ogni servizio.

The first is Location, Location and Location.  You could not want for a better place to stay in Montreal.  Firstly, you’re barely five minutes from the Atwater Market to get all those amazing goodies for your meals (which we did!) and five minutes from one of the Metro station that will get you to most of the key sightseeing places in Montreal.  We didn’t use our rental car during our three day stay there.  On top of that, walk out the apartment door and whether you went left or right, there was an amazing selection of cafes to choose from.  \n\nSecondly and most important is the apartment itself.  The apartment had everything you could want for your stay, a comfortable bed, great living area and so on.  Then add in the personal touches left by the host like fresh flowers, coffee, etc. and you can see why I can’t recommend Alfredo’s apartment highly enough.  I’ll certainly won’t hesitate staying there again should I return to Montreal in the future."},{"_id":"278757727","date":{"$date":"2018-06-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18776184","reviewer_id":"489744","reviewer_name":"Stephen","comments":"This flat is WAY better than the pictures show.

He was waiting for me at the flat even though I was running late due to traffic from the airport. A great welcome from him from the moment I walked in. The flat is actually quite large for a single traveller but would be perfect for a couple. Alfredo thought of everything: from a well-stocked kitchen to tons of towels in the bathroom, to cable TV, and even fresh cut flowers! The flat is located minutes away from TONS of bakeries, cafes and restaurants, not to mention the amazing Atwater market. AC definitely helpful during hot summer days. The flat is on two levels located above a pop up shop; so no noise issues from neighbours. However, it is located right on a busy street; so if you're a light sleeper, highly advisable to bring earplugs. Otherwise, a truly wonderful stay.

There are so many amazing restaurants and bars within walking distance. My favorite was the ice cream shop - La Diperie.

We liked brunch in the place next door and dinner at both restaurants within a block or two.\nThe metro is only a few blocks away and  the 35 bus going to the old town right in front.\nWe didn't meet Alfredo in person, but he was very prompt in communications and accommodating to our needs.\nIn Montreal, we really enjoyed Bota Bota and the light show at the Botanical Gardens."},{"_id":"335209463","date":{"$date":"2018-10-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18776184","reviewer_id":"36201222","reviewer_name":"Sonya","comments":"Great location.

They should have opened the ceiling up when building as it is a box within a box.\n- No basic extras like milk, tea, sugar, salt.

Deja la temperatura bastante equilibrada.\nTiene bastante ruido por parte de los vecinos (se oyen los pasos) y también de los coches, aunque si te cierras la habitación, se insonoriza bastante.\nJusto enfrente del apartamento y como a 30-40 metros hacia abajo, hay una pastelería-cafetería que hace esquina que es IDEAL para desayunar: tienen de todo y muy bueno. Hablan español perfectamente y son muy amables. Los pasteles de Belén (que en Oporto se llaman Natas) están muy bueno.\nLo mejor es la ubicación, sin duda.\nMario responde bastante rápido y salvo el problema que tuvimos con el retraso, fue muy cordial.\nDejo, no obstante, lo sucedido con el retraso:\n\nAvise con exactitud de a qué hora llegaría al apartamento (21:15) y llegué a las 21:18. Hasta las 10:25 no vino nadie a abrirnos. \nEn toda esa hora y cuarto solo tuve 2 mensajes: 1 a las 21:30 (ya con 15 minutos de retraso) donde me decía \"On the way :) \" y otro a las 22:00 donde me comentaba que la persona que venía a abrirme había tenido un pinchazo. \nNo voy a dudar del pinchazo, pero lo que me pregunto es ¿Y los 45 minutos anteriores a la hora pactada, que van desde las 21:15 a las 22,...¿Dónde estaba? ¿Y ese retraso tan grande sin avisar?\nEso sin contar que hacía frío, llovía y teníamos hambre por las horas que eran.\nQue cada uno saque sus propias conclusiones."},{"_id":"227295646","date":{"$date":"2018-01-14T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18780832","reviewer_id":"59885404","reviewer_name":"Julian","comments":"The place is really nice and quiet!!

We have given the TPC many hours of notice of what time we were going to be arriving. However, when we entered, the place was still dirty from the last guests. Unacceptable. First of all, we had to pick up the key from the TPC office which is a 15 min drive from the apartment, this was fine because it is what was ultimately decide between myself and \"Mario\". But \"Mario\" was nowhere to be found when I got to their \"check-in\" office. I was met with a woman who was too busy yelling on the phone to another AirBnb customer who has booked a different apartment. When I had arrived to the apt, Mario said the crew should be there to clean... But not even an apology? He seemed unapologetic and ended the conversation. The \"cleaning crew\" finally got to our place maybe 30 minutes later after I had sent messages to TPC staff over (Hidden by Airbnb) because Mario was not replying to messages right away. About the apartment itself, extremely noisy. The family upstairs seemed to have been playing Dance Dance Revolution, or so it felt like for a majority of the time we were there given that i noticed a rhythm in their foot slamming. Jokes aside, I guess there is a lot of kids upstairs and they run around all the time. When the main door to the entire complex is opened, it slams closed and literally rumbles the walls. I am not used to Portuguese infrastructure, but it seems like they built these places with no sound proofing in mind. There is no ventilation in the apartment either, so with all the windows, it gets hot. Impossible to sleep at night for two reasons: The beds are absolute cheap IKEA garbage. Extremely extremely uncomfortable. The pillows are dollar store quality as well. My wife and I had one of the worst sleeps the last night we were there, we even unfolded the pink couch to try to sleep on that and it just gives you back spasms all night. Point #2, since it is hot, you want to open the window? Good luck, the apartment is on a busy street and people love to rip it in their Fiats, Honda Bikes, and trucks on that main road since its a one-way. Expect lots of traffic noise. Even with the window closed. Speaking of no ventilation, there is NO FAN in the bathroom, when you take a shower, i guess you could say the apartment also comes with a free sauna? And when you go to the bathroom and do your business, yeah its going to stink... for a while. The kitchen cutlery is extremely cheap, when i read the brand on the knives, yeah, you got it, IKEA. The \"sharp\" knife couldnt even cut butter. I sat on this review for a few days and I've toned it down a bit but my wife and I were not happy..."},{"_id":"274415073","date":{"$date":"2018-06-09T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18780832","reviewer_id":"190548705","reviewer_name":"Do Own (Donna)","comments":"This place is much prettier, cleaner, and spacious than it looks in the picture!

We took the Metro everywhere, from the airport to the coast to the across the Douro for Port wine tastings. You can drop your luggage off at their welcome center at the Casa de Musica Metro stations, and walk around a bit and have coffee until the apt is ready. This was a very convenient feature. From Casa de Musica station, you're just a couple stops away from Bolhao station and a few blocks away from the apt. A recommendation for the area: after the sun goes down on weekends, one the commercial streets down the road turns into a pedestrian mall closed to cars and is great for strolling, people-watching and trying pasteis do nata. There's also a Pingo Doce market about 5 blocks away in the same direction so you can stock up your fridge and pick up some (absurdly) cheap Douro wine. Overall, a good place to stay while exploring Porto. One drawback I feel obligated to mention is the significant noise from the road just outside, even at night. With the windows closed and the shutters locked, the noise is muted, but still evident. For those who like windows open or are bothered by the sounds of a city, I would take this into consideration. We only stayed here, so it may be that road noise is a feature of all apartments in Porto. But that said, for the location, service, and price, the Blue Balcony House was a good place to stay for our three days in Porto. Thank you TPC."},{"_id":"332422818","date":{"$date":"2018-10-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18780832","reviewer_id":"4664421","reviewer_name":"Geertje","comments":"Reasonably priced appartment at good location.

You feel a bit trapped in there as it's a house that has been cut into 2 flats and this one has no real outlook or access to the outside... other than the path to the front door. If you are basically just sleeping there it probably wouldn't be an issue but if you want somewhere where you can relax in a lounge room, cook a dinner and sit down and enjoy it etc etc this probably won't be what you are after.

La grandeur est parfaite pour une personne ou pour un couple et l'appartement est nimbé de lumière naturelle, ce qu'il est fort agréable. De plus, les hôtes sont discrets et très accueillants. Ce n'est pas très bien insonorisé, comme tous les appartements de Montréal, mais ce n'est qu'un détail sur lequel Pamela \u0026 Fernando n'ont malheureusement pas de pouvoir, alors comment leur en vouloir?

The floors and carpets were dirty and there were stains on it (my partner stuck himself a needle in his foot left on the carpet), particularly in the kitchen, where there were dirty dishes, even the sink had grease and dirt. The dish washer had stagnant stinky water in it. It was home of the cockroaches we found all over the kitchen, food left there and dishes. That’s why we needed to clean up the entire apartment so we could stand for the long of our stay. Tobi offered us to find a cleaner as soon as possible but never appeared. That’s something he needs to look up before anyone comes into the apartment. \nOther than that the communication was ok, even when we were not able to meet each other during our stay as he was out of town."},{"_id":"245048278","date":{"$date":"2018-03-20T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18848869","reviewer_id":"137487663","reviewer_name":"Yousuf","comments":"Absolutely perfect for the non fussy traveller that wants value for money and an awesome location.

I love a good morning shower, and this is the best ever. An on-demand water heater, I think.\n\nIf there is anything to be aware of, the parking is a little dicey.

The bathroom was private with a great hot shower and the bed was very comfortable.  The beautiful lanai was a highlight as it overlooked Michael's beautiful garden and personal touches. The view was phenomenal and large enough for dining and working at a computer while enjoying the sights of Diamond Head, the ocean and city below.  Finally we loved the neighborhood and its proximity to the bus, if needed.  We will never forget the chorus of birds singing from dawn until dusk.

He kept a package for me and gave us an option to leave our luggage at his place after the check out (we asked). His place is on a very steep hill so offers an amazing view. The pictures were truthful. The stairs to the loft are quite steep but steps are wide enough to make going up and down easier. I gave 4 stars because the extra blanket/duvet required some cleaning and there were some bugs. Given the location maybe the bugs are to be expected.... didn’t get much of the natural light in the room. The mattress upstairs is closer to a futon.

There is a fabulous view of the ocean and Diamond Head from the lanai where we enjoyed sipping wine in the evening and drinking coffee in the morning while listening to the birds.

Moreover, the artful design of the place is both aesthetically pleasing and very welcoming.  As host, Michael himself, is warm and gracious.

Elle est doté d'une grande hospitalité. C'était très convivial. Le quartier était sympa. La maison était à 5min à pied d'une bouche de métro et à proximité de plusieurs arrêts de bus.

They are both very friendly hosts and they made us feel relaxed and welcome in their home. Nancy has some basic house rules which ensure everybody staying at the house lives harmoniously in a clean and peaceful environment. We were very grateful for that because our room and the shared facilities were clean at all times. The house is warm, the room is cosy and the bed was comfortable. The location is great. It doesn't take long on the L line subway to get to Manhattan and there are lots of nice places to eat along the L line in Brooklyn itself. The neighbourhood is quiet and the subway station is a short walk in a straight line from the house. You won't get lost! The neighbourhood is like any other suburban area just outside of a city centre so just adopt the usual street-smart attitude you would anywhere else. We had no problems and felt safe. Considering how comfortable the accommodation is and the house's close proximity to the subway station, the price is really excellent. If you're on a budget you can even save money by cooking at the house.

On arrival, Helen made me dinner and we spent some time exchanging songs and playing the piano. Jason was full of great local advice and whenever I had a question or query he could not have been more helpful. Really efficient communication as well. \n\nIf you're someone who wants a quiet place to stay, this will suit you well - definitely not a party venue which suits me down to the ground as I'm generally looking for a quiet place to sleep. The air con in the room works great too - it was quite warm while I was in New York so that helped a lot! \n\nThe place is really close to subway where can get the F line that runs you into Manhattan. Typically I was spending a lot of time in Midtown or the lower east side, so you're looking about 40mins door to door for most places in Manhattan. I'd recommend downloading the Citymapper app when traveling anywhere - this'll also help you to take the shortest route to the station. \n\nWhile I wouldn't describe this as being a very trendy part of Brooklyn, there is no shortage of food shops and take aways nearby (and Jason again made good recommendations for this too). It's a bit dimly lit at night but as someone who made the trip at all hours of the morning solo, I felt pretty safe. The area is also really diverse which is always a plus :D\n\nThank you so much Jason and Helen x"},{"_id":"202976855","date":{"$date":"2017-10-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18908638","reviewer_id":"16735923","reviewer_name":"Dom","comments":"If you are looking to stay in Kensington, this is the place to go!

This place is great value: the house and room are super clean, the bed is comfy, the neighborhood is safe, the subway\nstation is a 5 minute walk away. Jason is very helpful and accomodating. His mom (Helen), is very sweet. She cooked breakfast for us, bought us tasty\ndumplings from Chinatown, and shared her passion for music by singing to us. If you are looking for a safe, affordable, and confortable place for 1 or 2 people to stay while\nin NYC, look no further. I recommend Jason's place without reservations.

We needed something a little bigger than what most of Porto has to offer (we had four people staying together) and this place was wonderful.

This was not a problem for us because the weather was nice enough that we would just walk downtown and get an Uber back. Public transportation also isn't ideal from this location (would have to catch several busses to get to city center), but it is definitely an option here. The host was a little late, but her thoroughness and helpfulness absolutely made up for it! The Porto Concierge was so helpful, and offered information about tours, airport transfers, etc. They also provided a 24 hour phone number for any issues or information we might need, and also included a bottle of wine on our arrival.

One of them was out of order and no one let us know before we had already moved in. The communication was very irregular and consisted mostly in copy-paste, we never felt like we could actually talk to someone. Workers came twice while we were there to fix the toilet, which they didn't. \nOverall the apartment is practical and charmless, and that's okay.

I was so pleased to have a private entrance, private bathroom in a very private studio room detached from the main house! I loved the mini fridge stocked with the different snacks and juices. I loved the coffee machine with the variety of coffee, tea and hot coco - my only request for next time is to have a few Starbucks (Pike or Sumatra ) K-cups :) .I even made a short video to show my wife - she was very jealous and wants to come there in the very near future. \nI was so happy to walk into a warm, comforting room after a long day of travel - thank you for turning on the heater for me!\nI wish it was not raining so I could have enjoyed my morning coffee on the porch :) \nWhat also made my experience great was that you, Luis are a great communicator- which tells me that you take your business very seriously. I can say that your price is very fair and I had a great stay at the Cozy Cottage!

I can tell Luis put a lot of thought into the cottage. I arrived pretty late from dinner with friends, and had a little trouble unlocking the key. Luis was a phone call away and did not seem bothered that I called so late. The bed was SUPER comfy! The shower took a while to get warm, but eventually it was  perfect. The toilet was clogged upon my arrival. I did not see a plunger ( I may have not looked hard enough because I was in a rush in the morning).  The fridge is stocked with snacks and beverages. This was such a thoughtful touch. My only complaint was how cold it was. There were 2 heaters, but they didn’t do much because outside was super cold.

The place is in the Bronx, located close to a police station and main road, so it is very safe. We would come home at 12-1am without any issues. The place also has a rite aid close by (5 mins walk) and if you are hungry, there's an amazing pizza place called Cestra's (very friendly), which is also 5 mins away.\nThe place is a little far from Manhattan but an express bus (BxM8, approx. 10 mins walk) will take you to Manhattan (30 mins to 1 hr during rush hrs).  The express bus costs $6.50/1 way. When you reach Manhattan, you can buy an unlimited 7 day pass for subways and local buses (does not include express buses) for approx. $35/person. \nOverall, our experience was great."},{"_id":"263283446","date":{"$date":"2018-05-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18914730","reviewer_id":"158458055","reviewer_name":"James","comments":"AWESOME AIRBNB!

Luis had communicated the lock box password before hand so I walked right in like it was my own place. \n\nHis place is clean and private and the parking spot is amazing given NYC and it’s parking costs. \n\nHe even leaves you some snacks and drinks in his mini bar and the bathroom, although small, had clean towels, soap, shampoo, and conditioner on the wall in the shower . Nice touch.\n\nIf I had to gripe about one thing it would be the fact there is no cable TV and the WiFi signal is bad so even though he has Roku to watch shows it barely worked. But I didn’t come for that so it didn’t bother me too much. \n\nThe neighborhood felt safe and even though it’s not next door to Manhattan the express bus is only a two minute walk from his door and a twenty minute ride to Central Park. The deli on the corner at the bus stop sells metro passes so very convenient. $26USD will get you a full day of transit.\n\nAll of this to say that I feel $150CAD a night is fair and I would stay at Luis’ again."},{"_id":"285402397","date":{"$date":"2018-07-03T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18914730","reviewer_id":"61948649","reviewer_name":"Brianna","comments":"Luis set my boyfriend and I up with some complimentary drinks and snacks and was very easy to get in touch with when any questions came up.

The host Louis was kind and went above and beyond to make our visit worthwhile. \n\nCheck in process was quick and easy there’s a lock box next to the door simply align the numbers in the middle lane with the code and you’ll get access to the key. I have nothing bad to say about this place or the host. It’s close to La Guardia airport and there’s even a McDonalds nearby within walking distance and other restaurants. \n\nSome notes: I would recommend this place to those traveling by foot or public transportation. Parking was really hard to find after 7pm, there are paid parking meters from 11-7pm, I found it troublesome having to coming out every two hours to pay for the meter since I couldn’t find parking. The host was kind enough to allow me to use his private drive away. That was a nice gesture of him.  I wish I would have traveled using a taxi or public transportation. Nonetheless like I said this is a great place to stay and it was lovey despite the hard to find parking. (In NYC is hard to find parking anyway so if you’re traveling from abroad save yourself the headache and don’t rent a car) don’t let this decoupage you from staying at this great cottage. It’s a good value :)"},{"_id":"322589635","date":{"$date":"2018-09-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18914730","reviewer_id":"56147760","reviewer_name":"Daja","comments":"Great space, great host, I would definitely stay again"},{"_id":"323034596","date":{"$date":"2018-09-14T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18914730","reviewer_id":"213363693","reviewer_name":"Carlos","comments":"The best place"},{"_id":"323419089","date":{"$date":"2018-09-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18914730","reviewer_id":"174628364","reviewer_name":"Zustin18","comments":"Luis is a pleasure to work with and we had an absolute awesome experience with him and his Airbnb!

Very convenient to public transportation. Cousins was a great pizza place literally around the block, 5 minute walk. Luis was great and always responded very quickly! It was just my daughter and me, and we came back at 11pm one night by the bus. I wouldn’t recommend that to females alone - it was a longer walk to where the bus let us off at that time than when we got on in the morning (when they make more stops), and that was a bit unsettling to walk 1/2 mile without many other people around in a dark place I wasn’t familiar with, and just us girls. This has no reflection on Luis’ place or location, rather an inexperienced tourist lesson learned. I wouldn’t want to walk anywhere new at 11pm, and didn’t realize we would until we were in the situation. If coming back that late again, I’d take a cab/Uber. \nReally enjoyed our stay!

Much better than a hotel. It was a clean, fragrant, cozy room like a picture. There are also microwave ovens, tableware, and coffee machines. The location was also fantastic. Waikiki Beach is right in front of you, bus stop, pink trolleys, McDonalds and ABC are very close.  There is also security, so it seems safe for women to live. Laundry rooms on the first floor are easy to wash. Then, there is a cheap, delicious, sweet fruit house.) Host sherry is very kind. Her answer to the prompt was always quick and accurate. Thanks to her, I could make good memories in Hawaii. Also, the Hawaiian Chocolate she prepared was so delicious and touching. If we come back to Hawaii, we will stay here again. Everyone who lives here will be satisfied.

There's a 24 hour convenient store and laundromat downstairs so you can buy supplies and do your laundry. It's also located near many places to eat, including a lovely vegan friendly place that is less than a minute awat from the building's entrance. It's in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Waikiki, yet it is peaceful and quiet once you get inside the studio apartment.\n Jian, the host, was very communicative from the very beginning and keeps the place beautiful and tidy. You won't find a better spot to spend your nights (maybe even days) than this lovely studio apartment. Highly recommended if you're traveling alone or with a significant other.

The neighborhood is fabulous with grocery stores, a great patisserie, restaurants, etc. all within half a block.  The doormen were also very helpful with suggestions.  Instead of the two big screen TV's in the living room, as pictured, there is now a HUGE pull-down screen the length of the bookcases with a projector-type TV.  The guys loved it for the final NCAA basketball game.  The apartment is on the ground  floor and even some of the passers-by on the street commented on the size of the screen.  There is a Sonos sound system operated by an iPad that the owners provide that we loved as well.  The bedrooms are in the back with windows that open and at night, even with the windows open, it was very quiet. The two cribs plus a bassinet, tub toys, etc. make it very infant friendly.  However, there is a circular stairway that leads to a loft which is not kid-friendly in the sense that there are no barriers other than the one railing to prevent falls to the lower level.  Izzy was kind enough to let us use the sofa-bed upstairs in the office for our adult son who was with us for part of our stay. The kitchen is very well stocked as this is an apartment that is lived in when not rented.  Closet space was a bit tight.  This really is a HUGE apartment for New York and it was so nice to be able to relax comfortably when we weren't out exploring.  We even had a Sunday brunch for 11 people who, like us, were in town for a wedding and there was more than enough room for us all.  Highly recommend."},{"_id":"29965549","date":{"$date":"2015-04-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1897001","reviewer_id":"22143812","reviewer_name":"Speros","comments":"Having arrived in NYC late afternoon our driver dropped us off at what we thought was the right address.....panic started to set in when we couldn't find the apartment! As it turned out, I had incorrectly recorded the address and the apartment building was only some 20m up the road.  When I called Izzy, she responded promptly and welcomed any further contact or queries we might have; the doorman had our key and was expecting us.  The apartment was great it, accommodated the four of us well with plenty of space to relax after the long and adventurous days in New York. The apartment had a theatre set up which was great for watching movies.  The apartment location was perfect for us with lots of great restaurants within walking distance, which meant we didn't have to go far for late night dinners.

When we did take the tube so easy: 2 short blocks from mainline tube taking you north and south.

Perfekt for familie med 2 voksne og 2 barn, men har sovesofa på hems om man er flere. Vi var 5 ( 2 voksne, barn 17, 16 \u0026 8). 2 flotte bad og veldig bra kjøkken. Kjempegode senger og luftig og god plass. Veldig enkelt med doormen og sikkert med 2 dører før man kom inn til døren til leiligheten. Gitter foran vinduer. Moderne aircondition med både kjøling og varming. Generelt en varm leilighet om man reiser om vinteren. Vasking er inkludert i leien. Izzy var på ferie, men svarte raskt på spørsmål hele veien. Kule møbler, designelementer og innredning. Romslig og fin leilighet.

Neither the TV nor the hot water worked and while the internet was reliable for a few days, it stopped working and never came back on for my last 20 hours even though I notified the host and he repeatedly promised to get it working again.

This location was pretty spacious, the table in the listing photos can be expanded, and the internet was over 120 Mbps and was very stable.\n\nLocation-wise, it's right in between Ho Man Tin and Hong Hum MRT stations. It takes around (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) minutes to walk to one of the stations. It's also very close to a bus stop.\n\nThere was some minor concerns over cleanliness regarding some trash and communication was initially a little bit slow and done on (Hidden by Airbnb) .\n\nBefore you book anything, you need to know that this spot is in the heart of the funeral district. It means that the first things you'll see when you walk out the front door are shops selling funeral flowers, coffins, and urns. This really wasn't a big deal for us as there's always people walking around the neighborhood. In fact, it was nice that this area wasn't as crowded.

The complex is only minutes from a shopping center that has everything.  Brad is a great host.  Overall we really enjoyed our stay. \n\nHowever, I found the kitchen to be poorly equipped with no proper cutting knives, limited cooking tools such as wooden spoons or a colander, and it had only small number of plates/bowls.  When I gave this feedback to the manager he went out immediately and purchased those items for me.  The apartment is also ageing: the washing machine broke down while we were there (but it was replaced with a big brand new one), the dishwasher did not work great so I ended up hand washing everything, and the carpets were ageing.  The blinds also do no close well in the master, which let in a lot of light at night.

The lanai is great, as is the living room, kitchen and master bathroom (including laundry). The unit has no shortage of beach towels either! The beds are not great though, they are quite hard. The dishwasher also is not the best, it acted up a bit, stopping its cycle shortly after starting. The buildings themselves are pretty old and sound travels very easily, especially the neighbours stomping around upstairs (which can make for some rough mornings). \n\nThe location is nice if you want to be a bit outside the busy area. There is a little shopping centre about a 2min drive away for groceries and things of that nature. There is a rocky cliff area that makes for great sunsets and you can walk to a black sand beach at the north end of the complex to see turtles (if you are lucky). To walk to the nearest public beach, it's about a 10min walk, but we had a great time snorkeling at this beach (for whatever reason the wildlife here was more abundant than at Hanauma Bay in Oahu - even saw some sea turtles). \n\nCommunication was a bit of a problem, though Brad responded quickly. The instructions could use some work, as \"Directions from your host\" and \"check-in instructions\" contain different information (importantly, the gate code was not included in the check-in instructions). Also, the wifi details provided were not correct, but in the guidebook in the house, they were correct. The host mentioned that there would be a second set of keys in the unit but they were nowhere to be found.\n\nOverall, the unit provided good value, though there were some flaws which could be improved upon."},{"_id":"347789915","date":{"$date":"2018-11-11T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19014550","reviewer_id":"87132028","reviewer_name":"Kendra","comments":"Brad was responsive and provided all information very quickly.

The couch for the 5th person was comfortable enough to sleep on. Check in and check out were simple and Jose was really quick and friendly answering questions during the stay! \nYou can get to Manhattan easily by train A which comes every few minutes (express and local). But you should be aware that in the evening the A train operates only local so that it takes way longer. But for us who went to Manhatten in the morning and returned in the late evening it wasn't a problem at all. You cannot expect to be in Manhatten in 10 minutes for that price. \nI highly recommend this apartment!

For delivery of take aways, we found they were not keen to take a foreign (UK) mobile number as a contact number but with persistence, they eventually took the order and we had nice Chinese and Japanese meals. \nThis is a good place to base yourself when visiting NYC but it takes approx 40 mins to get into Manhattan - the Subway service is very frequent- so some planning is needed.\nHighlights of our trip were cycling in Central Park, walking over Brooklyn Bridge and in DUMBO, visiting the 9/11 memorial/ museum, the usual tourist sites, walking the High Line, and seeing Broadway shows. We picked up reasonably priced tickets by going to 'tkts' (in Broadway) and queuing up 2 hours before curtain up as they sell off the empty seats at a discount. \nJose was easily contactable but we had no problems during our trip."},{"_id":"346386468","date":{"$date":"2018-11-08T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19030149","reviewer_id":"130744817","reviewer_name":"Marie","comments":"Great Place and great host!

Overall, a 10 out of 10.  The condo was as advertised in the photos, but pictures don't do the bed and shower justice.   The memory foam bed was very comfortable and the shower has some serious pressure.  Easy kitchen in which to cook, and the wifi was very reliable.  Only \"hang ups\" were with check-in (had to pull bed sheets/pillow cases out of the dryer and put them on bed/pillows myself) and parking, from time to time.  While parking is, in fact, free, it's not entirely hassle-free.  To Shereen's credit, though, she makes this known in her condo's listing.   Parking in front of the condo is nearly always filled up. On Rues Bourget, Irene, Sainte-Antoine, and Sainte-Jacques (four main streets near the condo) you don't have to pay to park, but you're not allowed to park during certain weekly times.  For example, on the north side of Rue Bourget (right in front of the building) you'll be ticketed if your car is parked between 8 and 11:30 am.  Then, on the opposite side of the street, you're forced to move your car on Tuesdays from noon to 3:30 pm.  Moral of the story?  Come enjoy Shereen's awesome condo, just don't bring a car.  You can Uber anywhere from her centrally-located spot in less than ten minutes for about ten bucks.  Overall, an awesome stay and I look forward to being back."},{"_id":"174968920","date":{"$date":"2017-07-27T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19030572","reviewer_id":"59655515","reviewer_name":"Pamela","comments":"Shereen's place was bright and clean.

It situated in the historical center of Porto. Appartment is on a 3 floor without  elevator, but it's ok. All useful information about Porto, helping with our luggage, well coming light lunch for guests was provided.  It was a little bit cold in a living area but on a second floor (where beds situated) was warm and comfortable. It seems to me that in summer time it will be very good there. We highly recommended to stay in this  appartment. Thanks for everything."}]}

The property which is attached to the side of a residence is on a main road.  The unit doesn't have air conditioning which most homes in Hawaii don't, as utilities in Hawaii are expensive and nighttime temperatures don't nesastate it.  So having all the windows open at night will make quality sleep a challenge especially if your a light sleeper.\n\nThe owners were friendly, helpful and communicated well both before and during my stay.\n\nAloha!"},{"_id":"185867146","date":{"$date":"2017-08-22T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19056339","reviewer_id":"140402304","reviewer_name":"鹏","comments":"A great house in Hawaii, enjoy it!!!"},{"_id":"189466063","date":{"$date":"2017-09-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19056339","reviewer_id":"144037288","reviewer_name":"Ryo","comments":"It was fantastic stay for our family. very close to the beach, supermarket, some restaurant, bus stop... really nice place!

Our little suite was perfect for us.  It was clean, pleasant, and nicely decorated and stocked with everything you'd need.  The bed in the bedroom was very comfortable, and the futon in the living room worked just fine for my daughter.  The many ample windows allowed the gentle trade winds in.  There was no AC, but certainly there was no need, as we were never overly warm.  Best of all, Bret and Shawna were themselves warm, welcoming, and helpful.  They have a sweet, calm lab, Bella who greeted us friendlily from time to time, and two quiet little kiddos who toddled around the front yard from time to time but who were never noisy.  Also, and this is a big plus, they have 3 bicycles and a couple of kayaks to you to use for free.  Bret will even help you load the kayak onto your car.  The beach is an easy 10-15 minute walk or 5 minute bike ride away, and the shops and restaurants in Kailua town center are only a 10 minute drive or 20 minute easy bike ride away.  All-in-all, a great place to stay, out of the commotion of Waikiki, but yet only 20 minutes away from the airport, Downtown Honolulu, Hanauma Bay, or many cool hikes.

They have a bunch of chairs and beach equipment outside their front door, which she told us to use whenever we wanted.  The location is on a busy street, but the apartment is quiet and there is plenty of free street parking.  Public beach access is about a 10 minute brisk walk.  This isn't a luxury place, but it is fairly priced for the money. \nKailua is a great place to stay!  Plenty of good restaurants and beaches, without the frantic tourism of Honolulu."},{"_id":"338541684","date":{"$date":"2018-10-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19056339","reviewer_id":"2193191","reviewer_name":"Abigail","comments":"Shawna’s place was perfect for my mom, grandmother, and me during our stay in Kailua.

She recommended an off the beaten path place in Honolulu called La Mariana which is one of the last original tiki bars in Hawaii. It's a restaurant as well and has great history and has been the back drop at different times for the Hawaii 50 show.  So if you're interested in that kind of thing, it's worth the drive.   Shawna is a wonderful host and her upbeat energy is amazing.  We highly recommend the Nautical Nest!"}]}

Very clean and quiet, and the location is very convenient -- 15 min drive from JFK and \u003c 10 min walk to the A train. I really appreciate the easy, late check-in! My two qualms: 1)  there is a really crinkly plastic wrapper on the mattress, which I found a bit annoying, and this can be easily fixed. Ultimately I slept fine, but I'm a good sleeper. Since this bothered even me, I can imagine it being problematic for people who can have trouble falling asleep. 2) from the reviews, I thought I would be staying with a family. But I arrived to an extremely sparsely furnished apartment with a few young guys in it, seemingly a hostel of sorts? This is totally fine, but not what I was expecting, which was a little jarring."},{"_id":"200814268","date":{"$date":"2017-10-06T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19063118","reviewer_id":"103063182","reviewer_name":"Kay","comments":"Very reasonable price to rent the room in NYC!"},{"_id":"202287835","date":{"$date":"2017-10-10T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19063118","reviewer_id":"147441209","reviewer_name":"Atilla","comments":"Herşey için teşekkürler.Temiz ve güvenilir bir yer."},{"_id":"202493747","date":{"$date":"2017-10-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19063118","reviewer_id":"118410067","reviewer_name":"Maher","comments":"Great value"},{"_id":"202943951","date":{"$date":"2017-10-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19063118","reviewer_id":"24403445","reviewer_name":"Yuki","comments":"Very well recommended!

When I got there, the teenage son let me in and showed me my room, which was clean, had my towel for a shower, and a bottle of water as well. The bathroom was also in good condition. I accidentally went over my 9:00am check out the following morning, as I had some alarm/daylight savings time confusion...but the host was again understanding, and messaged me ahead of time to remind me of check out (this is when I realized my phone was still 1 hour behind). I apologized and headed on out. Their home is less than a 1 minute walk from buses that will take you where you need to go in NYC, whether it be connecting to subway or airports.

I would not recommend this place for couples, as the room has a twin bed. Also, if you want to spend most of your time in Manhattan, I would suggest finding some place closer, as it takes about an hour to travel by bus/subway to get to manhattan from here. The ad lists this location as being 15 minutes away from Laguardia airport (LGA), but that's not entirely true. If you're taking public transportation it's about an hour from LGA. Even if you use an Uber ($20-$30 fare), the only way you can make it in 15 minutes is if you don't hit any traffic. It's closer to a 30 minute drive than 15.

The pictures are accurate. You're provided with everything you need for the beach including towels, nice chairs, big umbrella, snorkels, etc. The apartment is very close to downtown Kapaa. You can walk places, but it's much better to have a car. The pool, hot tub, and grill were great. There was an issue with the AC and Robert had it fixed right away. The town is very cute and well located to visit the west and north of the island. While the apartment is across the street from the beach, you cannot swim there as the surf is too rough. We swam at other beaches and in the pool. You can walk from the apartment down the beach to a great bar on the ocean with a wonderful happy hour (lava lava beach club). Free parking spot, coin operated laundry, guide books provided. We would definitely stay here again.

Our last day accidentally overlapped with another party booking through a different website, so we had to spend our last night in a hotel. Bob refunded us for that night and gave us a discount for another night. The refrigerator didn't work while we were there, but Bob had it replaced as soon as we let him know about it.

First off, it is in a great, safe location very close to public transit. There are a number of great restaurants and shops all around the studio. \n\nThe Studio: THE STUDIO IS BIGGER THAN YOU THINK! The photos don't do it justice. I've stayed in a number of studios in NYC and this is by far the most spacious. We were pleasantly surprised! Note that you have to climb two flights of stairs to get to the apartment, however; that is very common in NYC especially in pre-war buildings. \n\nIt is also beautifully decorated in an elegant yet modern theme and newly renovated. The apartment is very, very homelike and cozy. The kitchen has everything you would need, including a Keurig with K cups! The bathroom was very clean and the shower pressure is nice (hard to find in NYC). Towels, a hair dryer and shampoos/ body wash were also provided. As I mentioned before, the studio is large... so large that it fits a king size bed that is very comfortable. The A/C works great as it cools the entire studio. The TV includes Amazon Fire, Netflix, Hulu, HBO, and all other regular channels. \n\nThe Host: Sanjay is very communicative with messaging/ texting which I appreciated. We met him at the apartment and he gave us a rundown on the house rules and answered any questions we had. He and his girlfriend were nice enough to leave us a bottle of wine! \n\nSanjay's studio is by far the best place I've stayed in when traveling to NYC. I plan on coming back to this apartment for my next NYC trip.

It was close enough from the museums and other attractions so we could go back, rest a bit and then back out to enjoy the early night. Very close to the subway which we used to get to all the attractions. Same with bus. Supermarket across the street and another a couple of blocks away. Awesome place overall.

We got the keys from the lockbox located close to the apartment (2 sets of keys), then went to the apartment. \n\nAfter that is when things went downhill.\n\nThere were 3 separate locks on the door, and of the 3, only the top one turned. The bottom lock refused to turn even though the key fit, and the doorknob itself was jammed. After facetiming with Sanjay, we resolved the situation and managed to get in. It turns out the door WAS jammed, and the upper lock wasn't great. \n\nDespite Sanjay saying the housekeeper had been there that day, there were stains on the bedsheets, the floor was dirty, and there was a strange half-empty drink in the fridge. In addition, later when Sanjay went back and checked, he would find a previous guest's belongings there. Clear evidence that the housekeeper had NOT been there.\n\nAs two girls, we felt pretty unsafe about the situation now with the lock, and we wanted to look for housing elsewhere. Sanjay was very accommodating and gave out a refund quickly when we asked. \n\nI personally walked back to the 7/11 and returned the keys into the lockbox. This should have been the end of our communication, and I would have been happy to give 4 stars for the quick resolution. \n\nHowever, at 2:30am, Sanjay messaged and said that he didn't receive a notification for the keys being returned. I said that I had returned both sets into the same lockbox, and I also told him that because I had only swiped one fob when returning them, it might be an issue with him swiping a different fob from me when putting it in, as there were 2 sets of keys. \n\nAt this point, it should have been easy for him to try and contact customer service for keycafe, as I later had to do. The situation could have been resolved entirely on his side. \n\nAt 3:30am, I received more messages. He accused me of not having returned the keys and threatened to charge me again for the two nights (which airbnb had already refunded) if I didn't return the \"stolen keys\" within 30 minutes and said that I was lying about returning the keys from the directions that I gave. \n\nWhat if I had been asleep at 3:30am, a time at which almost anyone would have been asleep?\n\nIn addition, he then said that he had only given me ONE set of keys. However, he KNOWS this is untrue because we had facetimed earlier and he had seen both sets. \n\nI had to contact keycafe personally to resolve the situation. By this time, it was around 4:30am, and Sanjay never even issued an apology afterwards for the accusation or the threat. \n\nThis was a horrifying experience that I would never wish upon anyone."},{"_id":"260958020","date":{"$date":"2018-05-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19070513","reviewer_id":"16714898","reviewer_name":"Rachel","comments":"This spot was the perfect location for us for our business trip.

We came with the intention of exploring the city as much as we could, and this apartment is situated perfectly near a couple major NYC trains. Loved being able to walk a block and jump right on the 6. The room had plenty of space and Sanjay makes sure to have everything you could possibly need to stay comfortable. Plenty of towels in the bathroom. Big kitchen. Comfortable bed. Sometimes we forget how many items we have that need power, but our host had it covered with USB and power outlets all over the apartment. A bunch of them.  It was also nice having a large refrigerator and freezer to save leftovers, something we often overlook in hotels. During the 4 days we were in NYC, it was under a heat advisory and that made traveling around the city on train or foot pretty miserable. The apartment has a unit that keeps it as cool as you would like, and we enjoyed coming back to it. We really did feel like we were at home in the apartment. It was so comfortable. The TV was big. WiFi was fast, but I will point out that we had none for the last 1.5 days of our stay. I tried to fix it but no dice. The box just stopped receiving an internet signal from the cable. It came back on once or twice for a few minutes but went out and never came back.  It wasnt a big deal because we weren't in NYC to stay in the room and use WIFI, but should be taken into consideration if you're visting the city for reasons where you absolutely cannot live without it. Before it went out, it worked fast and with no drops. These things happen. \n\nWe will definitely stay in this place again when we come back. Thanks again, Sanjay.

It’s a quick commute into the city (however note that the 6 does not stop at the 77th exit on weekends). Also just a few blocks from Central Park!! So fun to walk over and enjoy some coffee in the park. \n\nThe apartment is warm and snuggly! The kitchen is fully stocked and their is coffee waiting! Plenty of towels in the bathroom! For a hot shower, you may need to run the water for a few minutes while it heats up!! \n\nThe bed is very comfortable and lots of cozy pillows to snuggle!! As most places in NYC, there is street noise (the trash men come at night)...but with the help of some white noise we had a very comfortable sleep!! \n\nSanjay is very easy to communicate with! The apartment was very clean! The key pick up and drop off is 5 blocks away so just know that in advance as you are planning your day!!"},{"_id":"351076779","date":{"$date":"2018-11-21T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19070513","reviewer_id":"14406102","reviewer_name":"Austine","comments":"Sanjay’s place is fantastic!!!

The place was very clean and, for a couple, very spacious. The place had the essentials needed for a good stay. We liked that Sakina offered us parking behind the building (her private parking area). There were a couple of things that we didn't like, though. The first one was that Sakina's was not quick at responding to our messages. Actually, she never answered the first message we sent her once we were in her property, and she was not prompt to respond to a couple of other messages. The second thing is that the place gets very noisy from around 5am to around 8am. We stayed there during weekdays and in the basement we could hear them getting prepared for their day. In all, we had a good stay, but based on previous reviews we had higher expectations.

So high marks for that!! \n\nI have to say though that this feels like a dorm room with mismatched furniture, incredibly hard (not just firm) beds, 1 pillow for each person and very very basic of things that should be nicer for an Airbnb. There are just a couple older poor quality pots/pans, you will need to pick up what you need in the form of spices and the cheapest possible blow dryer that stops every 1-2 min so it can cool down.\n\nIf you like extra extra firm bed, you will love this place ! Most of us do not but for some, they will like that aspect. The master bed was just as hard as the portable beds that that are in the 2nd room. It’s like putting a thin mattress on a wood floor and sleeping. Also to note for the light sleepers, there is hot water running through the pipes that squeals through the pipes all day/night so if you are a light sleeper ..that 2nd room or living room are not places to sleep between the hard bed, full light and noise.\n\nAt the end of the day, it was a place to stay centrally located down south which is where we wanted to be."},{"_id":"223662462","date":{"$date":"2018-01-01T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19101306","reviewer_id":"63460233","reviewer_name":"Jesse","comments":"We absolutely loved our stay.

The heating is also out of their control which meant the apartment was stupidly at all times other than when the hot water wasn't working!

When we opened the door, the first thing we saw was an overflowing garbage container. The bed in the master bedroom was used and unmade. The towels in the bathroom were used. \nWe started making the beds and we realized that the bed-sheets in the linen closet were not clean. They had stains and smelled. It seems that they were simply folded and put in the linen cabinet. When we tried to change the pillows, we noticed that they had yellow stains; one had blood stains on it.\nWe felt completely disrespected and unwelcome. \nWe slept in bed-sheets used by others and left running from this apartment the next morning.\nThe overall feeling of the apartment is tired and outdated. This is a very noisy place. The living room and the master bedroom have air-conditions on the windows giving the sense that the windows are open and all the noise constantly travels in the apartment. \n\nLastly, a couple of days before our arrival. the owners explained to us that the apartment is an illegal airbnb and if anyone asked we should say that we are friends of them which did not make us feel very comfortable.

The place is very small, but hey is Central Hong Kong, could not be handier!It looks exactly like the picture. It is about 6 minutes walk from Central station (exit D1 turn right and the right and 1st left and is the 4th street/laneway on your right) and Hong Kong Station (from the airport) is connected via an internal walkway.  I was able to check in my luggage at Hong Kong Station in the morning of my departure. so so handy! Don't bother taking a taxi, the train system in Hong Kong works! Everything in the studio works well, great air con, washer and dryer is incredibly helpful, hot water just turning a switch.  The bed is on the hard side, I personally prefer a softer bed. wireless Internet can be slow. Ryan is very responsive to any questions and his assistant Romelia very helpful when you get lost, trying to find apartment. The apartment is in this laneway in the middle of 6 bars/restaurants that are incredibly loud. Lots of expats having fun. as soon as the elevator doors close, THERE IS SILENCE. A complete an absolute pleasant surprise! Because the apartment is on the back of the building, the noise is absolute minimal! if you go there you will understand! Lots of people around at night having innocent fun, and is a very safe location. if you party that is you place, if you want a handy place that is also your place.

But why would you want to sleep in HK anyways?\r\n\r\nLocation is one of the best ever. It is right above Lan Kwai Fong and is filled with good bars and restaurants. Transportation is fast, took us 5 minutes to walk and we were at the Central MTR station. Lots of shopping can be done around the area. You can easily find your favorite luxury brand within a 5-10 minute walk from the area. If you are a coffee drinker you can also easily find your favorite coffee stand 2 minutes away. We also felt quite safe to travel in and around the area at any time of day. To sum it up this location is EXTREMELY convenient. \r\n\r\nLiving there was a different story. The AC was loud, the bed/bedsheets were uncomfortable. The entrance to suite smells like incense and chicken. Extremely small suite if you have never been to HK. When the bars/restaurants open up at night, the \"promoters\" heckle you non-stop until you get to the entrance of the apartment. Wifi is extremely slow, technically it isn't really wifi, it's mobile internet turned into a wifi hotspot.  \r\n\r\nQuick tips: Try not to check in at night after work hours, it's going to be really hard for your driver to navigate the crowds of people walking the streets and random drunks on the side of the road about to burst out. Do not speak to the \"promoters\" of the bars and they will eventually recognize you and stop heckling you."},{"_id":"22251709","date":{"$date":"2014-11-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1910291","reviewer_id":"5405265","reviewer_name":"Hanne","comments":"Ryan was very welcoming and gave us a very good description in finding the place from the MTR.

Also I don't know what it is but a sheet and a comforter would be better than just a thick comforter on the bed. Half the time I was sweating while I was sleeping, the other half I was cold because I didn't have anything but the sweaty comforter to cover myself with. \r\n\r\nThe AC was barely working while I was there, I ended up opening the windows once the temperature outside had dropped enough.

A really helpful + cool bot.  To address a couple of the other review comments:  (1) The place is indeed compact, as others note, but I would add that I'm a gangly 6'1 guy and had no problem living here for four months.  (2) The internet/WiFi setup was replaced, and is now blazing fast and consistent.  No problems at all.  (3)  Although the apt is directly in the center of LKF, the window faces out back and noise is minimal.  I was an exchange student and regularly worked there without any problem.  A few recommendations for people staying long-term:  (1) the Pure Fitness in the California Tower just outside is one of the nicest gyms I've been to, and they'll work with you on price if you're only around a few months, (2) the BEP Vietnamese Kitchen right down the street was my favorite of the recommended restaurants, (3) If you're a bball player, there's a great court in Wan Chai (Southorn Playground) for pickup ball, and also a meetup group (HK Indoor Basketball Lovers) that rents gyms 4-5x/week and always has 18 men/women show up.  (4) Krystal + Ryan have another spot one door down, so if you have friends/family visit it's very convenient to have them be able to stay there.  Thanks Krystal + Ryan, you guys rock!

It is a 5 minute walk to the Central metro station. Communication was excellent, very clear and prompt. The price is digestible, for Hong Kong lodging. \n\nCons: The building, specifically the common areas and elevators, are not simply dated, but very dingy and unsafe-looking. As a single female traveling alone, I would've appreciated more heads up about the lack of security (over the two nights I stayed, the building front door remained open all night with no lobby attendant). There was some shouting and noise in the hallway at night, not uncommon for a city apartment, but not very comforting. The area is very commercial and crowded; if you're looking for a more residential / laid-back neighborhood, this might not be the right fit for you."},{"_id":"191520612","date":{"$date":"2017-09-08T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1910291","reviewer_id":"96392300","reviewer_name":"Geraldine","comments":"Krystal \u0026 Ryan's place is all they say it is and has everything you need for a great stay in Hong Kong.

Its good Washer/Dryer - And an iron! - were also greatly appreciated to have at the end of my holiday, and despite being set in the middle of several bars, the studio was pretty quiet.\n\nWould I recommend staying there?

One thing about the bathroom, (awesome rainfall shower head btw) it's a regular asian style shower/bathroom combo meaning there's a drain in the center. There is a slight barrier between the toilet and shower but it is still susceptible to being wet for a bit.  \nLocation wise this place is in the heart of Central right next to LKF (Bars and Nightlife area).

That said the studio is highly functional."},{"_id":"340757658","date":{"$date":"2018-10-25T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1910291","reviewer_id":"38963437","reviewer_name":"James","comments":"There is a reason Krystal \u0026 Ryan are super hosts!

I stayed there for six nights for a short work stay and family visit. Location is super convenient to walk to work and family visit in Kowloon is a few subway stations away. \n\nThe studio, although tiny (typical of central apartments in HK) is spot clean and well equipped with necessary amenities. \n\nOnly downside is because of its bustling nightlife location, it can get quite noisy during the night and thin wall would allow you to hear neighbor conversations. So careful choice for light sleepers... and because the building is quite old, elevator got broken down on my floor on last two days, but there’s a backup one that is one floor away. \n\nOverall it’s a very good choice for location-focused travelers for its price and Krystal is a super responsive host. Would consider stay again when I visit next time."},{"_id":"354166037","date":{"$date":"2018-12-01T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1910291","reviewer_id":"79807103","reviewer_name":"璨","comments":"我们非常喜欢这个房子,如果能准备拖鞋就更完美了,下次去中环一定首选住这里!"},{"_id":"355647169","date":{"$date":"2018-12-05T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1910291","reviewer_id":"23234098","reviewer_name":"Emily","comments":"Krystal and Ryan's place is right in the middle of everything.

Как оказалось, мои волнения были напрасны: Али замечательный хозяин, подробно ответил на все мои вопросы, объяснил как добраться от аэропорта до квартиры, без проблем встретил меня в 02:00 (я прилетела поздно ночью). Моя комната оказалась маленькой, но уютной с красивым окошком, выходящим в небольшой зеленый сад. Что касается удобств, то здесь достаточно скромно, но есть все необходимое: хорошее соотношение цены и качества. Сама квартира находится в очень хорошем месте: это небольшая спокойная улица всего в 2 минутах ходьбы от улицы Истикляль, где расположено великое множество магазинов, кафе и ресторанов на любой вкус и кошелек. Рядом метро и остановки общественного транспорта. Также неподалеку находится Галатская башня, музеи, рыбный рынок, можно легко добраться до района Фатих (пешком через Галатский мост всего за 15-20 минут). Мои соседи оказались очень приветливыми, дружелюбными и позитивными ребятами, мне было легко и приятно общаться в ними, даже не смотря на мой ужаснейший английский)) Подводя итог, хочу сказать, что моя поездка удалась на все 500%, и выбор данного места сыграл немаловажную роль: здесь можно с головой окунуться в атмосферу удивительного Стамбула, забыть о том, что ты турист и просто наслаждаться этим великолепным городом. Уже задумалась о моей следующей поездке в Стамбул!\nОгромное спасибо, Али! Больше гостей и больше друзей в твоем доме :)"},{"_id":"324429396","date":{"$date":"2018-09-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"191079","reviewer_id":"195852854","reviewer_name":"Colin","comments":"Ali is really an outstanding host. While it may be cliche to say that he responds to 'everything' Ali really cares about his  tenants/clients and responds to everything in a very timely and immediate fashion. Ali is always happy to help with anything. The location I stayed at was really cleanly kept, rules were fair and clear, and the price point is unbeatable for the location!

Steps from the waterfront and surrounded by restaurants, bars, cafes and shops. It's also larger in person then in the photos, more then enough space for one, would definitely fit 2 very comfortably. \n\nThe only downside is that the unit is on the 4th floor, so getting luggage up or coming home after a long day of walking the hills of Porto can be a challenge. \n\nIf you're a light sleeper may want to pack some earplugs. There's no a/c so on warm nights you'll want the windows open, and there is noise from the nightlife in the area, well worth the trade off in my opinion to be close to it all.\n\nAlso I used their car service to pick me up from the airport. My driver was waiting for me at arrivals with my name on a sign, was super friendly and coordinated my check-in en route to the apartment. highly recommend!"},{"_id":"183899434","date":{"$date":"2017-08-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19113128","reviewer_id":"46138921","reviewer_name":"Paola","comments":"The apartment is very nice, modern and clean.

Plus, you have only one pair of keys, but you need them to open the main door on street level, even from inside.

During this 2 hour wait, I sent several messages through airbnb messenger that went unanswered. We found a local gentleman who was able to call the contact phone number for us and only after several failed attempts were we able to reach the company and get someone to let us into the apartment. Upon entering, the apartment was uncleaned (towels, linen, and garbage everywhere from the previous guests). When we expressed our displeasure the woman who let us in smiled and laughed in our faces.

Huge delay on the check-in time, leaving us under the rain. The house was not prepared for us, and we had to wait even more after the hostess arrival. Everything in the neighborhood and entrance was dirty, full of cigarettes and water from the rain. The clothes from the poor neighborhood were also hanging in the house. When we got to the place it was unbearably cold (4ºC) and the hostess refused to provide us with a heater. The electricity outlet was coming out, which could even be dangerous. We tried to contact the company, but got no answer from them.

We opened the windows which would’ve worked fine but there was loud construction nearby which made having the windows open a nuisance. The hot water also lasts very short and the hair dryer needs a “break” after a few minutes of use.

Just by walking down the alley you're immediately on the water side with many restaurants with a great view of the water, boats and bridges. By walking up the alley, please mind it is gets a little steep so it's a good workout if you do it a few times a day, you'll cross Sao Bento train station.

The neighbourhood is safe in general and we encountered no bad surprises! \r\nPros: Frank and his team are really easy to find and very helpful. They provided everything we asked or at least they tried. The doormen are 24/7 and very helpful!\r\nCons: The apartment though had some issues. Firstly the jets don't work properly at the hot tub so its more like a small pool. One of two safes and the microwave were out of order. We had some difficulties to fix the right temperature of the water in the showers as well. When we visited there was noise coming from the renovation of the apartment just underneath ours so we had to wake up at 8 every day except weekends. Overall it was a satisfying experience.

Pros: Location, location, location! It's awesome and right on the beach with tons of places to eat and drink right around the corner! We were granted an early check-in and a late-check out. The view of the beach is fantastic and the lighting in the apartment is reminiscent of The Max from Saved By the Bell! Elisa, who helps you get the keys and communicates with you when you arrive in Rio, is welcoming and always reachable by (Hidden by Airbnb) . The doorman, Simão, is delightful and super friendly. We miss him already! \r\nCons: This is advertised as a five star penthouse, however, we think it is more of a three star. Our group is all good with a three star, no problems...we have all stayed at a many Motel 6 before and hostels, but the advertising was not quite accurate. The space does not have the same furniture as pictured in the living room. We had previously contacted Frank about the \"pool\" because we saw prior guests write that it was not working. Frank assured us that it was, however, it did not work. Ivo, a maintenance man, came by twice to help and ultimately, it never worked. We felt bad, as it was not Ivo's fault and he also came by later because the second bathroom did not have hot water. Overall, we had a lovely time exploring Rio and we would have appreciated an honest representation of this space.

I wholeheartedly recommend Camilo's country house. You should know that it is not only a house but also a huge private garden with all sorts of amazing things to discover. \n\nHere are just some of our unbelievable impressions and experiences from the stay:\n- We made our own mojito from the private country house farm, where we picked lemons and mint leaves to mix with.\n- We picked our own figs, grapes and other great-tasting fruits from around the garden whenever we felt like it.\n- Private swimming pool with pool cleaning.\n- Private football field, with locker rooms. Camilo even helped us find a pump for our football, and bought a new football for us.\n- We found lots of cute animals walking around the garden, such as goats, chickens, ducks and mini-pigs.\n- We went mountain-biking, with the excellent mountain bikes, to the top of the mountain which could be seen from the balcony, and the charming village on nearby. We also hiked/ran to the same mountain and discovered other breathtaking paths and sights.\n- We went to the Merendas Park a short 7-minute drive away. There was an amazing gorge, river and suspension-bridge to explore.\n- In the middle of our stay, Camilo's wife, and a housemaid, came to clean the house for us.\n- Camilo and his family were all very nice and talkative, truly great Airbnb hosts.\n\nWe were thoroughly impressed, and our only point of improvement would be to supply better Wi-Fi/Internet, although this was not a problem because the mobile connection for our cell-phones was good enough. I'm sure Camilo will remedy this quickly though so I would not worry about this for another stay.\n\nA+++ to this Airbnb listing from me and my family."},{"_id":"282026830","date":{"$date":"2018-06-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19137059","reviewer_id":"20716732","reviewer_name":"Kitty","comments":"Eleven of us had a great family holiday in Camilo and Maria's house. The kids loved the pool, garden and especially the puppy who they wanted to bring home. Having pets living around the house is an added bonus on holiday!  Camilo and Maria have a lot of land surrounding the house which was being worked on while we were there and guests in the main house should expect to share the pool and grounds with other guests . The (Hidden by Airbnb) Maps locator is significantly inaccurate so be sure to contact the hosts for directions! Maria was very helpful and attentive and at the property on most days.

The owners didnt clean appropriately, e.g. the fridge was full of old food and was extremely dirty, also one of the bathrooms was super dirty with black hair all over and pee and poo in the toilet :( After we complained, they send somebody the next day to clean the house. However, we think its not acceptable at all and even after the cleaning we did not feel comfortable and didnt enjoy staying there and especially cooking in the kitchen, as all the facilities and gadgets are kind of dirty and smelly. \n\n- they told us the whole property is privately for ourselves, however, there was another couple making holidays in the wooden house. We never saw them but they were  allowed to use our pool as well. They didnt do it in the end, because we complained about it, but anyways thats not fair!\n\n- the property is a building site: they are currently building 4 more bungalows on the property and nobody told us about it! During the week you can even hear it.\n\nAll in all due to these reasons we cannot recommend staying there and we would never come back.

After I made my reservation, Catia told me she had only made her apartment available by accident and that the date was not available. After some back and forth, Catia said she could do it, but it would be a late check-in. I was in a pinch, so I agreed (I had come to Porto from the US a few days earlier on a day's notice to take care of my parents who had gotten in a nasty car accident, and were in hospitals 2 hours apart - I had nowhere to stay that night, and I was figuring all of this out on my phone in a public space). Shortly after, Catia informed me that there wouldn't be wifi. I needed wifi to be in touch with hospitals and doctors in Portugal and back home, so this wouldn't work. Catia emailed again a little while later and assured me I could use wifi from the bakery downstairs, but that felt tenuous to me. I was alone, spending my days on trains and in hospitals, and really just needed a safe, dependable, no-surprises place to come home to; between the delayed check-in time, the wifi problem, and the multiple messages with changes, this didn't feel trustworthy. I decided to cancel, I politely told Catia, and she was very understanding. I went to the Airbnb app, and the system said I couldn't cancel, because the reservation had already been cancelled. I tried again - ironically because I wanted to leave a note affirming that Catia tried her best - but again, it didn't work. I figured Catia cancelled it herself, and I moved on to find a new place to stay. A week later, after returning home, I realized I had been charged for the reservation - the cancellation didn't go through somehow - and after some back and forth with Airbnb, it turns out that Catia refuses to refund me. It all makes me pretty sad, to be honest. The impression I got was that a series of accidents got in the way of this being a good place for me to stay, but I really thought Catia was well-intentioned and trying her best. Now it turns out that she doesn't really care about the impact of any of it, and just wants the money. It's clear that the apartment didn't meet the description, and I have emails between us where we agreed that the reservation would be cancelled, and I obviously didn't stay there in any case - but she still wants me to pay for it. Catia is saying that I didn't technically cancel, so she couldn't host anyone else. During the day we were going back and forth, she sent me more than a dozen messages - she couldn't send one more to ask me to follow through on the cancellation? Or just cancel it herself? And after Airbnb got in touch with her on my behalf to ask for the..."},{"_id":"175695737","date":{"$date":"2017-07-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19149590","reviewer_id":"134084103","reviewer_name":"Sónia","comments":"Apartamento muito bem localizado, perto de tudo.

Aunque ella no nos recibió personalmente, su madre nos esperó hasta una hora tardía, tras la llegada de nuestro vuelo, y nos recibió y explicó todo con gran amabilidad y simpatía. El apartamento está bastante bien situado (aunque cuesta arriba), muy cerca de todos los lugares céntricos (Avenida de los Aliados, por ejemplo) y a un tiro de piedra de la estación de metro Trindade, con conexión directa con el aeropuerto y el resto de las líneas de metro. Todo es nuevo y bastante bien cuidado, aunque el espacio nos pareció algo más pequeño de lo que prometía en las fotografías (da para dos personas con equipaje) y el precio que pagamos un poco alto. El mayor problema para nosotros fue que, pese a los vidrios dobles de las amplias ventanas, al estar situado en una avenida con no poco tráfico, por las noches el ruido de los coches y motos que aceleran para subir la calle es bastante molesto para conciliar el sueño. Sin embargo, el colchón de la cama era nuevo y muy cómodo (algo poco usual en apartamentos de alquiler temporal). Aunque la televisión no funcionó durante los días que pasamos allí, parece que era un problema de la antena del edificio. Los demás electrodomésticos funcionaban perfectamente, al igual que el wi-fi. Por lo demás, en las inmediaciones encontramos cafés y un supermercado en un centro comercial cercano. Fue nuestro reducto durante nuestra visita a Oporto y ayudó a que disfrutáramos de la ciudad y a que queramos volver cuanto antes.

As there are 3 nice bedrooms, you could very well stay there with 6 people without getting on each others nerves. It even has two tv/DVDs - in case you cannot agree on which film to watch ;-)\r\n\r\n The west coast is NOT touristy. It has some very nice sandy beaches, frequented mostly by local people. So if you are looking for a non-touristy holiday, it's perfect. However, this also includes tuning down your expectations of local amenities down to \"normal life\" standards (i.e. no beach bars etc.) if you feel like more glitz: Honolulu and Waikiki is only about a 40 min drive. \r\n\r\nDulce is the most welcoming and warm person.

It's beautiful, clean, and the area is incredible.  It's just a stunning value for what you're getting.  What impressed me the most was how thoughtful they were in putting the place together and making sure that it had EVERYTHING.  (The towels earned rave reviews and I have been \"encouraged\" to make similar upgrades to my own apartment.)  Great decor, too - tasteful, luxurious, homely, and varied: the rooms are each themed differently.  \r\n\r\nI know that Waianae has something of a poor reputation, but the immediate neighborhood is GREAT and feels like any high-class suburban area.  \r\n\r\nBefore booking, you do have to understand that it's located about 45 minutes outside of downtown Honolulu (traffic depending), so if you're not willing to make that drive then you should look for another unit, but for us this wasn't a downside - we LOVED our experience.  There are also beaches and hikes (Kaena Point) and snorkeling (Electric Beach may be the best place on the island and it's about 15 minutes south) and camping and a few restaurants closer to home if you decide you don't feel like it after you've arrived on the Island, and the home itself is just a terrific place to relax.\r\n\r\nI have stayed in a few of the major hotels in Waikiki, and this unit is so much better that you shouldn't hesitate at all - it's quieter, cleaner, much bigger and more comfortable, and a vastly better value.  Plus it comes with a parking space.\r\n\r\nThe hosts are also fantastic and they really cared about making sure that we had a great time.\r\n\r\nVery, VERY highly recommended.  Absolutely ideal for a family or anyone looking to get out of the City and recharge for a few days."},{"_id":"10474866","date":{"$date":"2014-02-20T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1915001","reviewer_id":"12306517","reviewer_name":"Jonathan","comments":"We had a great time in Dulce's large, comfortable house.

Rick then spent a few minutes showing us the many amenities of the house (beach gear, towels, BBQ, etc.) followed by 20 minutes where we just chatted about the attractions in the area including the local artist that provided the amazing art hanging in the house. Rick is a fantastic source of information and gave us plenty of tips including one that saved us $250. \r\n\r\nAfter settling in we spent the next 8 days exploring all over the island, putting 700 miles on our rental car, but always returning in the evening to a nice comfortable home. This was ideal for us as we only had to grab towels, a cooler, and the gear we needed for the day. We could travel light, not worry about our luggage, and know there was an ice cold beer waiting at home (beer not provided). It was also great not worrying about packing too much clothes since we could do laundry in the evenings after a day of adventure. \r\n\r\nThe proximity to Ko Olina was also perfect as our preferred Luau and sailboat/snorkel tour were based out of here. There are 4 major resorts in Ko Olina so there's plenty to do there . We spent time at the Aulani Disney Resort and Ko Olina Lagoon. \r\n\r\nThe bottom line is that this house is perfect for those interested in getting out and exploring all corners of Oahu. If all you want is to lay on a beach then one of the many resorts would be a better choice. If you want a very comfortable, affordable, spacious base-camp to call home while you explore the island, then this place is perfect for you. \r\n"},{"_id":"29915394","date":{"$date":"2015-04-14T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1915001","reviewer_id":"7732876","reviewer_name":"Steve","comments":"Dulce and her family were awesome hosts.

Her vacation home is as exact as the home a lot of guests described. I read most of reviews because our family travel(6 adults, 1 kid, 1 infant) is celebrating my father's 70 year old birthday and I want to make sure any unexpected cancellation would not happen. She and her husband introduced so many details to me and my wife upon arriving. Our staying was as same as other reviews such as $25 discounts at Sack \u0026 Save with her account number. One thing that I regret is not doing BBQ more than twice because we were so tired every night. I am also worrying about dump trash in a wrong trash basket outside. I was told that Richard asked me move black one in front of house on Mon anyway. My family were 100% satisfied with her vacation home and hope to stay there or her other home again soon.\r\n\r\n한국 사용자분들께서 한국어로 후기를 남기셔서 저도 조금 도움이 될까 싶어 남깁니다. 일찍 예약하기도 했고 위치가 와이키키와 좀 떨어져 있는 것이 유일한 단점이지만(트래픽 시간을 피해서 다니는 것이 좋습니다. 코스트코가 위치한 곳 지나서 이 집까지 왕복 1차선이 외통수길이라서 막히면 시간이 꽤 걸립니다) 가성비가 정말 좋은 집입니다. 저는 개인적으로 와이키키의 북적대는 곳보다 다소 시간이 걸리더라도 평범한 미국식 가정주택에 묵는 경험을 추천해드리고 싶네요. 주인도 매우 친절하고 집은 정말 관리가 잘 되어 있어요. 후회 없는 선택이실 것 같습니다.

The kitchen is fully equipped, e. g. with fridge, freezer, dishwasher, fridge, etc. We kept some drinks and fruit in the fridge. \nThe city centre and the river are only a few minutes' walk away. We rented bicycles for four days, which was a little bit unnecessary because everything can be reached either on foot or by metro.

El apartamento es amplio y luminoso (aunque carece de estores o cortinas y las persianas tenían que estar casi todas bajadas para protegernos del sol). No dispone de TV pero sí de equipo de música. La cocina es sencilla pero completa, suficiente para una estancia breve. Dispone de lavavajillas y microondas. La habitación 3 es muy amplia aunque falta de armario. El baño está en el pasillo, con lo cual no es un baño privado. Además tiene un grave problema de cañerías, el olor es nauseabundo y estaba lleno de insectos. También es importante recalcar que tiene dos tramos largos de escaleras, por lo que no es accesible a todo el mundo. Por lo demás el piso está bien y la atención fue buena. Una vez que sabes que es un piso compartido las expectativas cambian. Aunque es imperativo que solucionen el problema de las cañerías urgentemente.

We enjoyed beach which is really few minutes walk. There is lot of coffee, bars, restaurants around (5-10minutes far). But we were so happy at home as well. The house is so clean and pretty after reconstruction.

The hosts were so responsive and very easy to get ahold of about everything. Right from booking it was quick and easy. They are so sweet and really do go above a beyond what an airbnb host would be expected to do. Besides a little misunderstanding on my hectic check in day (not hectic because of them, just in general) they were very easy to get ahold of and made sure I had everything I needed at all times. They have WAY more available for use than any other airbnb I've stayed at and they are so kind to let you use everything in their house. Even your private bathroom comes stocked with literally everything, even more than I would have in my own house. The place is so clean and welcoming and stylish. It is VERY close to the restaurants and beach area and the area is very safe and quiet... a nice break from the city centres for sure. I had a GREAT stay and would absolutely recommend anyone looking to visit this beach area to stay here.
