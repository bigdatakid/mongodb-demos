To get to the North Shore and back takes 4 hours, twice as long as a car. But for shorter distances, TheBus is great, and it goes almost everywhere almost all the time. If you’re planning on sticking to the Waikiki–Ala Moana–Downtown region, go with TheBus, which will save you a lot of car hassle and expense. The most popular route is no. 8, which arrives every 10 minutes or so to shuttle people between Waikiki and Ala Moana Center (the ride takes 15–20 min.). The no. 19 (Airport/Hickam), no. 20 (Airport/Halawa Gate), and no. 40 (Waipahu/Ala Moana) also cover the same stretch. Waikiki service begins daily at 5am and runs until midnight; most buses run about every 15 minutes during the day and every 30 minutes in the evening.

We had a great time! The condo is clean and well-appointed. We had five adults staying here, and we never felt cramped. The place is well stocked with plenty of linens, including a generous supply of beach towels. The kitchen had plenty of dishes for virtually any cooking need, including a tea kettle and two types of teapots. The building also has a recreation deck with a pool, exercise room, sauna, ping-pong tables and more.\n\nThe check-in process was incredibly easy. We texted the host when we left the airport and were met at the condo by a guest host who showed us around and helped with our bags. In an unexpected complication, one of our party had broken their leg before the trip and was in a wheelchair. We hadn't booked the location with handicap accessibility in mind, but it turned out great. For anyone traveling with mobility issues, this is a good location. With an elevator and ramp out front, the wheelchair was no problem. The bathrooms are a bit too tight for a wheelchair if that's a requirement for you, but that's normal for any place that hasn't been specifically designed to be wheelchair accessible.\n\nThe only downside I'll list is that the foldout couches aren't that great. There are five beds in the bedrooms, but one of our party snores and was going to sleep in the living room on one of the foldout couches. It turned out that the mattress was very thin and after a very short discussion we decided we could wear earplugs because an adult would probably not get a good night sleep on the couches. That said, the five of us slept great in the five beds (two are bunkbeds, but were fine even for adults). The place isn't brand new and has signs of wear around the edges, but no more than one would expect in a vacation property. \n\nOverall, we were very happy with our stay and we'd both recommend it and go back there again!"},{"_id":"200778848","date":{"$date":"2017-10-06T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14252305","reviewer_id":"33359841","reviewer_name":"Jihyeon","comments":"위치뿐만 아니라, 청결도 안전까지 굉장히 좋은 곳이었습니다 :) 중간에 문제를 해결해주시는 것도 아주 빨랐고 좋았습니다 ^^ 없는 게 없을 정도로 완벽했어요 ! 주변에 쇼핑과 먹을 곳이 굉장히 많이 아주 좋았습니다 ! 다음에 또 가고싶을 정도였어요."},{"_id":"202296091","date":{"$date":"2017-10-10T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14252305","reviewer_id":"54155245","reviewer_name":"Peter","comments":"We have enjoyed Mark's apartment immensely.

About 5-min walking distance to the beach. The place was spotless and the ocean view from the bedroom with the double beds was absolutely incredible.\n\nThe place had a sofa bed, an ottoman that turned into a single bed, and extra blankets/bedding in the closets. \n\nThe place was very comfortable, felt like Home. The second bedroom with the full bed and bunk beds was very comfortable as well, it’s just a bit cramped as there isnt much space other than the beds and a small closet. But we were able to store luggage under the beds which helped, and not to take away from how great this place is, just to give an idea of what the room is like.\n\nHowever there are so many other options for sleeping such as the two beds in the living room plus extra mats/bedding in the closet so if the one room feels cramped there is plenty other space to either sleep or store luggage.\n\nThis place would be perfect for a bigger family and even has items there for a baby like a high chair and some other things too.\n\nThere were also boogie boards on one of the balconies which was very nice to have.\n\nOverall I️ highly recommend this space, and I️ actually wish I️ had the chance to stay and relax in the room more because I️t was really that nice and comfortable."},{"_id":"287173848","date":{"$date":"2018-07-07T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14252305","reviewer_id":"107273540","reviewer_name":"Kelsey","comments":"Mark was great to work with and responded very quickly.

Connecting these two beaches on the ocean side of Iliili Road across the street is a lovely green lawn elevated over the water providing a perfect setting for watching nightly sunsets.  Cove Park is the premiere spot in Kihei for surfing and stand-up paddling, and the entry area for this calm ocean inlet is also located a half block away at the north end of the street.  The neighborhood is well located for enjoying easy access to a large variety of fun activities, restaurants and shops all nearby within walking distance. Another block away is the large oceanside Kalama Park, which is the site of annual festivals such as Whale Day in February and Earth day in April.

Comfortable, well equipped with all the essential kitchen appliances and accessories. Air conditioning in the main living room, and portable air conditioning in the bedroom which worked a treat during our stay. The added extras such as beach chairs, beach mats and a drinks/food cooler was very much appreciated, and used every day. Parking is right at the front and easy to access. \n\nThe location is to die for. Having explored every part of this amazing Island we agreed that our favourite location was Kikei. The locals were very friendly, access to restaurants and supermarkets was just minutes away, and many of the Island learn to surf clinics (highly recommend doing this!) were run from a beach 5 minutes walk along the street. Every day we swam with turtles at the beaches immediately in the area of the apartment. You can literally walk out of the apartment, across the road and watch the sunset over the ocean every day.

Check in was seamless and he had 2 bottles of water for my husband and I in the fridge. He also laid out some snacks and candies for us, and had coffee and tea for us. We thought it was very kind of him to do that. The only con was that the air conditioner is in the bedroom closet, and when the closet door is closed it’s okay. But when you open the closet door to let that cool air into the room, the AC is loud. So this made it a bit difficult to sleep through at night. We were also bummed we never got to meet our host and we called him to inform him we were checking out and he never got back to us.

A winning note to all untanned people coming into Hawaii - they did have aloe vera in the bathroom.

You are close to the center of activity on Bedford street (about 15 minutes of walking or 2 stops on the subway), but you are remote enough that you have a quite space for yourself and a more spacious apartment. The neighborhood is an old Italian neighborhood, so you will have traditional Italian grocery stores, restaurants (il passatore is awesome) and pasta shops. You are also close to the best ramen places in Brooklyn like Okonomi or Suzume, or great Korean food in Greenpoint (Little Dokebi).","notes":"The apartment is on the 3rd floor, so guests will have to go up 2 flights of stairs.","transit":"The apartment is 5 minutes away from the subway (L line), which goes into Manhattan in 3 stops. So getting to downtown Manhattan doesn't take longer than 20 minutes. If you want to take an Uber / Lyft to anywhere in Manhattan or Brooklyn that will also be a decent option.  Street parking is very easy in my neighborhood. Guests with cars have not had any trouble finding a spot.","access":"Either I meet you or I leave the keys for you in a lockbox out front. I send you the code prior to your arrival. To assist check in and check out, guests can arrive and depart anytime of day or night I usually give a quick orientation to the space and the neighborhood.

I understand that Eytan doesn’t charge a cleaning fee so it’s kind of understandable that the place wasn’t sparkling. Otherwise, it was just great. The bed and towels were clean. \n\nIn terms of location, the apartment was near to public transportation and we felt safe walking at night in the neighborhood. \n\nMy sister and I have to commend the host on his communication – he was just superb!

The history will grab you. The beauty will enthrall you. Peace will overcome you. The daily, intense rainbow will delight you. You will sleep deeply in the cool mountain air. The house will fulfill your every need. \n\nWhen you’re done with the hustle bustle, heavy traffic, crowded tourist spots, you come “home” to a home that is quiet, peaceful, breathtakingly beautiful. The view of Diamond Head will greet you every morning. The birds will amuse you and the gardens will occupy you for hours as you notice tropical beauty on tropical beauty. \n\nRead the book provided by Stanton and Bruce called “The Wilders of Waikiki .”  You will be immersed in the intricate intertwining of the Wilders into the workings and government of Hawaii, first with the royalty and then with the territorial government. You get swept up in the parties held at the house in the clouds. You realize how important the people that lived there were and now you are living there for your vacation. In this house you are a resident. A part of its history. Important to it living on by the energy you bring.\n\nI will come back to the Wilder House hoping it remembers my energy and welcomes me again. I’ll gladly drive up the mountain with its hair raising, hair pin turns and drop off cliffs. The higher you go, the more rain forest you twist through. You see bamboo, eucalyptus, orchids, vines and banyons seemingly holding up the forest canopy. It’s a world separated from the usual reality. \n\nI hope you decide to stay at the Wilder House. You will be very happy with the experience. It’s as far from a hotel room you could ever get.

Spectacular views! Caring hosts! Historic, comfortable home!  Hawai'i doesn't get any better. This location, high up on curvy Round Top Drive, will give you the best of both worlds: an historical home, once owned by the scions of Waikiki, kept in close to original condition, yet with all the updates one needs to fully enjoy the house, away from the hustle and bustle of downtown Honolulu, yet a quick drive to any venue in the area. Shower in soft rainwater while looking out at the lush foliage surrounding the house. Sit on the meditation bench on the terraced yard while observing the grandeur of Diamond Head and Waikiki. Watch the beautiful tropical birds, including bright green parrots, as they flit through the trees. Your stay at The Wilder House will be one of the most memorable you will have in Hawai'i!"},{"_id":"363451814","date":{"$date":"2018-12-28T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14284682","reviewer_id":"28184428","reviewer_name":"Eric","comments":"Great views and super neat house.

The house is only a short drive from town (and Lyft accessible!) but feels worlds apart from the chaos of Waikiki.

Oh my goodness, the views. You won't find a lovelier view of Honolulu. It's a bit of a trek to get to the house (and you may find that Ubers are reluctant to take you up the winding hill, so would recommend a rental car), but it's worth it. We experienced some slight problems with the electricity due to some uncharacteristic storms, but the hosts very graciously worked with us to resolve the issue and make us whole for our stay. The home itself is lovely, and is great for hosting a large group (amazing living space on the top floor, spacious kitchen). Highly recommended!"},{"_id":"417049490","date":{"$date":"2019-02-25T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14284682","reviewer_id":"11666055","reviewer_name":"Justin","comments":"Beautiful house with a fantastic view.

The private backyard was a great place for our group of 6 to bond and experience Oahu’s nature first-hand as birds gathered early in the morning to feast on the feeder (a very small, but very nice touch!). The kitchen, dining, and living room spaces were also terrific hangout places between our adventures to Oahu’s attractions/destinations, of which many of them were approximately 30 minutes, making this house a central location for visitors. At least 15 of those minutes are dedicated to going down a mountain road (about 4 miles). So to the designated driver, be prepared! This was our 3rd time in Oahu and this house was by far the greatest living experience we’ve had in this island when compared to our previous stays at Waikiki hotels."}]}

Maui Vision became a reality and a business starting with my personal condo at the Kihei Akahi Resort C618.\r\n\r\nMaui Vision is a business I love because I get to share the Aloha Spirit, the beauty of the land, and talk story with people from around the world. It is nice to know that we can contribute to someone’s Hawaiian vacation experience in a positive way. We love to hear back from our happy guests.\r\n\r\nI used to live on the island of Oahu with my US Navy family when I was young.  We later moved to Southern California.  I knew one day I would return to Hawaii, the place I fell in love with long ago. I took a leap of faith and purchased my Maui condo June 2002 this was the beginning of fulfilling her prophecy to once again return to Hawaii soil.\r\n\r\nI am a tropical expression artist who paints on canvas and etched metal.  My work is inspired by the beauty of the islands and has been displayed in several Maui art galleries over the years.  I am a writer and have my first book on Amazon.

While I can usually overlook most shortcomings, the list was too many to ignore here. Wide angle pictures \u0026 professionally written listing descriptions will impress most - however, here are some takes from my REAL customer experience at the 414 condo:\n\n\"We will provide you with a special code to access the condo after you are booked and paid in full.\"\n\n- After a 13 day stay, we were charged a \"half day rate\" for a late checkout for 5 hours over our contracted stay. During our last day, we ended up being locked out of the condo. Thankfully the late checkout fee was refunded due to this situation. Not quite the goodbye from our paradise as we hoped for.\n\n\"This unit includes a window A/C in the living room should you need it although we find it is rarely needed because the tradewinds keep you comfortable.\"\n\n- The AC unit is a measly 12\" by 32\" window unit that had trouble keeping even the living room \u0026 kitchen areas cool. If 86 degrees in your bedroom while sleeping is \"comfortable\", then this might be the place for you.\n\n\"This setting is wonderful for romantic sunset strolls. For the more active person this is a great beach to run on as you can do so for miles in peace away from the crowds.\"  -- \"Three miles of quiet sandy beach will entice you to walk, run, or build sand castles.\"\n\n- Haycraft Park is roughly 500 feet away from the beach directly in front of this condo, and it was filled with people every day. Half the time we were here, there were campers there who stayed all day and over night with big fish lines across the entire beach. There may be other listings with better seclusion. \n\n\"This unit is spacious and bright.\"\n\n- Spacious? That's a stretch. But bright? You're absolutely spot on. If you enjoy sleeping in the dark, this place might NOT be for you. Waking up at 530am is ideal for the lighting of this condo, ever with the window shades (which many times had trouble coming down since they are on automatic motors). \n\nA POSITIVE NOTE:\nOne thing I cannot get over is the real Mahalo spirit of everyone staying and living at the Kana'i A Nalu resort. While my mother in law and 16 month old daughter got locked out on the last day, many guests there offered help, water, and to hang in their condos while we tried to wait patiently to get back in. The resort has an amazing location and even better spirit within its guests. \n"},{"_id":"223134007","date":{"$date":"2017-12-31T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14298859","reviewer_id":"68844759","reviewer_name":"Sue","comments":"Beautiful condo.

Could not be happier with this stay.  The house is beautiful, the surrounding front and back outdoor area is very spacious, interior is tastefully decorated, and the ocean is just yards away.  This was a perfect stay for our 2 yr old daughter who had lots of room to run around and absolutely loved the outside trampoline. The location is central to driving to Kihei, Lahaina, Paia or Kahalui. One of the best places my family has stayed.  There are charming ducks and chickens roaming around on the property - the only slight downside was the great amount of duck poop on the porch every morning but it was an easy cleanup with the outside hose.

Property itself looks even better than in the pictures and it is quite large. House is very nice and you will probably find everything you need even though if you plan to cook every day you might be somewhat limited. Biggest problem we encountered is something that looked cool at the beginning - ducks walking around the property. They would constantly poop at the front deck and the deck would quickly become disgusting and unusable. Even if you wash it out with the hose, it will take them no time to make the mess again. However, somehow they decided to leave the back (ocean side) deck alone so we were able to truly enjoy the beautiful view.  I would recommend the place to couples or families with older children - not babies or small kids as the bedrooms are awkwardly placed (one is right at the entrance door) so you have to walk through the whole house to get to second bedroom. The host vas very helpful and responded quickly to all our questions.\n"},{"_id":"133980420","date":{"$date":"2017-02-25T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14302702","reviewer_id":"10835588","reviewer_name":"Jeffrey","comments":"Awesome place!

The ducks and chickens were a fun addition to the property (though they did poop all over the entryway). \n\nUnfortunately, there were some difficulties that were hard to overlook particularly at this price point. The general house cleanliness was quite poor.. floors were super dusty and needed a good mopping. Some of the kitchenware had crusty dust or rust on them.

And the building itself was the most beautiful on the block. We really felt like we lived there.\n     The neighborhood, East Village, is amazing! It is our favorite. If we moved to New York, we would move there. It is very vibrant and has a cozy, local feel. We even went to a Russian Bath that is a couple of blocks from the apartment. It was fun! Everything is walkable to, and the metro is a couple of blocks away. There are tons of shops, cafes, and restaurants so that just walking around is an experience. Two of our favorite spots were a Bean cafe nearby and Strand Bookstore; we would stop at these every morning on our way to the metro.

It is a great neighborhood with the metro right around the corner. It is easy to get anywhere in the city within about 10-15 minutes, but far enough away from the madness of the tourists streets in the center. He stays across the way in front of this flat and visits each day to make sure everything is perfect! In between visits we say hello from our flat to his with a friendly wave! He has given us tips for great restaurants, bars, markets and sites in the area.

Un po come essere a casa propria.  Non manca veramente nulla!!!  Inoltre ha preso subito la cartina e mi ha spiegato dove andare a mangiare per poter spendere poco ma con qualità,  mostrato i luoghi da visitare ecc.. L'appartamento ě silenzioso, si trova al 7 piano di un palazzo ordinato in un quartiere (non centralissimo ) tranquillo in una strada principale,  appena esci dal portone hai tutto a disposizione, supermercati bar ristoranti ecc..  E davanti a casa si trova una fermata del bus,  prendendo il numero 54si arriva direttamente in centro (nel cuore della città) bastano 10minuti di tragitto, ticket € 2.15 e per la sera prendere bus N3.\nNAHUEL é una persona molto disponibile ad aiutarvi per qualsiasi cosa, comodo perché lui abita nel palazzo difronte al vostro,  inoltre il prezzo dell'appartamento  é veramente ottimo!!   Appartamento pulito ordinato luminoso  con spazi comuni molto vivibili e con un bel terrazzo!! Lo consiglio a tutti!!!  Un posto dove sentirsi a casa!!!

It made a lot of noise and let in a lot of night. The walls are very thin and the other guests in the house kept us up/ woke us up pretty much every day.

We were unable to meet Nahuel, but we were greeted by his girlfriend, Alex, brought us in and made us feel incredibly welcome. She was really helpful and gave us enough information to see the best Barcelona has to offer. \r\n\r\nThe room is big enough for two people and I never felt like I was restrained by the space. The apartment had an amazing view of a more local Barcelona where we could really get an idea of what it is like to live day by day here. The location is great, you are a 3 minute walk to the metro and about 5 minute walk to the airport metro line. \r\n\r\nOverall, it has been an amazing experience to stay here and I recommend it to anyone who wants to have a great time in Barcelona. Nahuel and Alex have been the perfect hosts and I will be sure to book this room the next time I visit Barcelona.\r\n"},{"_id":"87437562","date":{"$date":"2016-07-20T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1431666","reviewer_id":"25920867","reviewer_name":"Celina","comments":"Everything was just great.

Квартира полностью соответствует фотографиям, очень уютная, с домашней обстановкой, нет ощущения, что ты находишься в съемном жилье. В каждой мелочи заметно, что хозяин заботится о своих гостях - общие пространства разделены на подписанные по комнатам полки, а в гостиной много различной информации для тех, кто приехал в город впервые - карты, путеводители, указания где можно вкусно поесть. Ноэль и Алекс крайне отзывчивые и гостеприимные хозяева и что крайне важно, всегда на связи и всегда готовые прийти на помощь и помочь с любыми проблемами и вопросами.

Note their is no A/C so it was nice that she had plug in fans in each room. The only downside was the guest bedroom bed was not that comfortable (but if you like firm mattress you will be okay) and the kitchen had ants (which is due to the time of the year)."},{"_id":"47240289","date":{"$date":"2015-09-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"143175","reviewer_id":"11897159","reviewer_name":"Charlotte","comments":"Sabrina is an excellent host!

We eventually found a lot in the city (15mins away by über) to leave the car for the week, but that was a hassle checking up on it all the time. Also, while there is a washer and dryer it is the basement of the apartment for the use of all the tenants which cost money, so timing is key.

The apartment is beautiful, and just around the corner of Rue du Mont-Royal, which is home to a plethora of shops and restaurants - meaning if you choose to stay here, you have plenty of options for food and shop. Each morning I went for a walk down the beautiful street and stopped at some coffee shops on the way. It's also just a few minutes walk to the Metro, which is great if you'd like to explore the rest of Montreal. Or you can hop on a Bixi bike close to the apartment and ride downtown. But the best part of the apartment is how close it is to (what I believe to be) the best poutine spot in Montreal - La Banquise. The location is perfect for both young folks looking to have an exciting night out and families alike. Sabrina's apartment was clean, fresh and easy to access.

Manuela was the most incredible host. She was kind, gracious, attentive and made herself available if anything was needed during my stay. Nothing was needed, as everything was provided at the onset. Upon my arrival, she greeted me warmly, even arriving early to reserve a space for my car directly in front of the apartment building. She gave me tour of the flat and provided information about the city, how best to get around it and what hotspots to check out. \n\nThe apartment was quite charming; it was spacious with a sweet balcony overlooking the street. Manuela was kind enough to stocked the fridge with juice, water and milk and left pastries for the morning. \n\nThe flat is very conveniently located just 2 blocks from the Metro, which will take you immediately into the \"Sao Bento\" city centre. \n\nYou absolutely will not go wrong booking this space. I look forward to returning to it and Porto soon!"},{"_id":"141892610","date":{"$date":"2017-04-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14332326","reviewer_id":"10629239","reviewer_name":"Peter","comments":"Sehr herzlicher Empfang.

Manuela sempre atenta, responsiva, cuidadosa e atenciosa. Apartamento corresponde as descrições e fotos, localizado numa rua tranquila do bairro, próximo a Praça Marquês onde havia estação do Metro. Duas estações já era a Estação Trindade que agrupava todas as 6 linhas do metro. O apartamento todo arrumado e finamente decorado. Banheiro espaçoso, banho com água quente, chuveiro forte. Tinha secador e demais produtos (sabonete líquido, shampoo, condicionador, etc). As toalhas no entanto poderiam ser maiores e mais macias. Mas estavam limpas e cheirosas, nada que tenha atrapalhado. Cama grande, boa, confortável. Infelizmente para nós que somos do nordeste do Brasil a temperatura estava bastante fria, e um dos dias no meio da noite o aquecedor parou de funcionar. Por sorte o quanto estava aquecido e tínhamos cobertores no armário. No dia seguinte Manuela rapidamente providenciou o conserto e disponibilizou um aquecedor elétrico de reserva. Nossa salvação! Sugiro que já deixe avisado que tem um outro aquecedor de reserva! Ao chegarmos, além de toda paciência e amabilidade nos dando todas as informações de restaurantes, (no próprio bairro tem alguns), pontos turísticos, transportes, etc. A wifi funcionou super bem! Como choveu muito e fazia muito frio não deu para conferir a distância de ir até o centro caminhando como é dito no anúncio do apartamento. Manuela ainda nos deixou com alguns mantimentos na geladeira, pão, frutas (maçãs e laranjas), cápsulas de café, chá, água mineral, além de uma garrafa de vinho, e que não consumimos, pois ao sairmos pela manhã já comíamos fora e chegávamos tarde após já termos jantado. Bairro bem servido com farmácia, padaria, restaurante, lojas, e fácil acesso a transportes tanto ônibus, como metro e também taxi e uber. Não fica muito distante do aeroporto nem da Estação de Trem Campanha. Usamos todos os meios de transporte da cidade com bastante tranquilidade. E para completar toda a hospitalidade e o acolhimento de Manuela, ela ainda deixava seu carro estacionado na frente do prédio segurando vaga para nosso carro, quando fomos pegar na locadora e voltávamos dos passeios bate e volta para Braga, Guimarães e Aveiro... Uma observação: a indicação do local para comer a Francesinha, nós particularmente, não achamos que valeu o custo benefício. Entretanto o restaurante indicado por Manuela em Matosinhos, valeu nossa ida até lá, mesmo no frio, só para almoçar. O único ponto que realmente eu daria nota baixa , no nosso caso foi a falta de elevador, pois como já não somos jovens após um dia de andanças pela cidade chegávamos exaustos de cansados e ainda tínhamos que enfrentar escadas. E com malas grandes, o que salvou foi meu marido ser forte e carregar as malas pra cima e pra baixo. E se tivesse um computador ou notebook para livre acesso dos hóspedes seria perfeito... E ao final da hospedagem ainda nos deixou uns docinhos folhados deliciosos que comemos na estrada.

There are other bus lines within six blocks. Within a 6-12 block radius, there are two or three train lines. \n\nCons:\n-There are neighbors above that can be noisy (at least during my stay they were active).\n-The basement where the washer/dryer are is dark. Also, they washer/dryer is coin operated and there aren’t banks nearby. You have to hope that one of the supermarkets/bodegas give you change or come prepared.\n-Buses and trains require some transferring and walking. Getting into the more popular parts of Brooklyn or Manhattan aren’t very easy, especially at night or during the weekend when there are service changes.\n-I didn’t feel comfortable walking around the neighborhood past 5 or 6.\n-I recommend driving or ubering if you’re in this area."}]}

For the price, I would say that I made a good choice! My friend and I drove to Montreal and we didn't arrive until around 2 am. Jason gave very detailed instructions for self check in which made it really convenient as I wouldn't want to bother him at that time. After we had arrived in  Montreal, we commuted throughout our stay. It is a 7-min walk to the metro and I would say that the neighborhood is pretty quiet and safe (there were times when we went home around 1 am). Jason told me that we could park our car in the backyward which was a bit difficult to find since Jason did not respond when I asked him about it (not a big deal though because my friend and I figured it out eventually). The condo is just as how it looks like in pictures, and I especially loved the kitchen and the bathroom. There were essentials he left for us like soap, shampoo, towels etc. During our stay, we lost Wi-Fi for about a day and Jason fixed it as soon as he can. Overall, our stay was nice. I would book his place again.

We were given instructions how to access the unit before our arrival and the instructions are really easy to follow. When we arrived to the condo, there was also a guestbook with house rules, information about the condo, instructions how to get around Waikiki and much more. We found this guestbook really handy and helpful. The Condo The building is older than most hotels nearby and probably needs some updating. The condo is privately owned and when we arrived to the condo, it was modern, very clean and well lit. The room made us feel welcome and comfortable. Everything is as what the pictures show. The view of the room is absolutely breathtaking. Partial beach view to the left, buildings in the middle, and a gorgeous mountain backdrop to the right. The room is a bit smaller than what we had expected but it was good enough for two people, myself and my husband. The room is complete with all necessities. He has a full kitchen (there are hot plates to cook your food in if you decide), microwave, fridge, dishes, cooking equipment, beach towels, cleaning supplies like soap detergent, broom, and that is more than most would think of, we were pleasantly surprised. It has extra paper supplies also should you run out. Larry was also very kind enough to supply us with beach chairs to take to the beach, because when we arrived the pool was being renovated until December 1st. The only thing I would recommend is having more drawers to put our clothes in, or a luggage rack to put our luggages on. Other than that, this room has everything you should need. The Location We were pleasantly happy with the location. It is a prime location with everything just a short walk away. Not to mention, the location had very good views from all directions. There are a few restaurants just steps from the condo. Then there are more places to eat, shop about 10 minutes away on both directions going east or west on Kalakaua and Ala Moana Streets. The closest beach access is 10 minutes away, then if you walk further down to the east, there's access to Waikiki beach there as well, near other shops and restaurants. The Host We had the pleasure of meeting Larry on our last day as we were leaving. He's very pleasant to talk to and very pleasant to deal with as well. He is professional and did his best to make us feel welcome. From the start of our booking, he is very accommodating and responsive with any questions we had. He is very communicative and updated us with the pool situation and made the situation better with providing us with beach chairs and umbrella so we wouldn't have to rent any equipment at the beach since the pool was closed for renovation.

It came with all the things I needed and there were several amenities nearby. \n\nAt first, it felt like it was a little far from the beach, but after a day or so, I realised this wasn’t the case and the 20 minutes walk to Waikiki Beach seemed breezy. \n\nThe only thing which caused me a little disturbance was that it is located very closely to another condo, and so there would be noise from those other guests time to time. \n\nHowever, I had a great stay at Larry’s place and would recommend it to others."},{"_id":"224657278","date":{"$date":"2018-01-03T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14405901","reviewer_id":"43627544","reviewer_name":"Carlos \u0026 Jonathan","comments":"Great location, Larry's studio has all what you need, from kitchen stuff to beach chairs, towels and even an umbrella.

In the middle of Waikiki beach and Ala Moana Center. We walked everywhere in Waikiki and it is definitely manageable. There is street parking available but it is almost impossible to ever get a spot. We paid $25 cash only to pay in the parkade attached to the building. Building is run down and only one elevator seemed to work so getting to the 36th floor took some time but understandable and never was more than 10 minutes. Room was clean. Beach towels and mats are provided. AC cooled the room quickly. Full size fridge and hot plate made it easy for quick meals! Hallways and room had a strong smell when we checked in. Check in was super easy with Larry’s instructions. I would recommend this spot!

Not only was the home great, but the hostess was very personable and a pleasure to meet. We also got to meet her aunt, who is just as nice. Our flight landed before the check-in time and Ursula allowed us to drop our bags off so we didnt have to carry them around the city and even helped us search for a place to stay when our flight was cancelled (as she already had the room reserved for the next guests).

It was a very comfortable location. We were 4 adults and one toddler. \n Place provided all the beach gear and toys which was a  life saver with the little one. Great location next to lots of shops and restaurants. There is a nightly Luau show next door at the Hilton which we would sit in the Balcony and watch. The Hilton has a small alley with lots of shops and restaurants. Downtown Waikiki is about a 15 minutes walk (little less than a while). Lots to see on the walk over.  It was a nice added touch. There are fireworks on Friday nights which was also pretty cool. Our toddler was in heaven.  \n\nThe home does not come with any condiments or cooking oils/butters but there is a small convenience store in the location and across the street. \n\nWe did not use the pool since the beach is essentially in the backyard of this location.  Great place. Would stay again in the future.

We were located very close in between two train lines 5 min walking distance of that, a strip of clubs, stores, restaurants, etc while being right in the middle of downtown, so the value of this place exceeds expectations.  If you are a peace and quiet person and don't prefer the city life then this location is not for you because it is a non stop party area with plenty to do.\n\nDeborah was even so kind to allow us to check in extremely early, as we had a very early arrival time from the states, which was also very kind and also flexible for checkout, this place exceeded our expectations, thanks again guys!

The place is also right next to several Subway stops, so it was easy for me to get into Manhattan for work every day. Finally, Benny is a great host. He left the keys for me to pick up at my convenience at a cafe down the road, welcomed me with a beer and a chat, left some recommendations for me in my room, and checked in every now in then over the course of my stay to make sure everything was going okay. Next time I am in New York I will be reaching out again.

At first glance the neighborhood looks a little bit shady but as you walk by, you realize is just an upcoming area of Brooklyn. There are a loft of nice places to go, from vegan places to cool craft beer bars, all of them with the most hipster vibe. Even though me and my s/o had a private room, the loft was very crowded almost always and we did not feel we had the privacy we wanted. As of cleanliness, the standard was ok but it could have been better. I would recommend this place to young travelers and easy going couples who are looking for a nice place to explore the most fun areas of Brooklyn and Manhattan (it was a 35 minute trip on Metro to Manhattan).

The ORM was born of the combination of the main passions of its founders: the city of Porto and its cultural characteristics; the architecture and decoration; the gastronomy and photography and, above all, the contact with different cultures.\r\n\r\nThe project is based on the support and guidance of property owners located in the center of the city who want to direct their homes to the tourism market.\r\n\r\nIt also involves the design and decoration of these same spaces, giving them a unique identity that translates into the extremely positive reaction of our guests.\r\nOur project culminates in the total management of the property, which includes the organization and preparation of these spaces for the tourist rental.\r\nSo with our dedication and daily work we have been able to please our guests who show the highest intention of repeating their experiences with our team. \r\nIn addition, besides the management, we are responsible for the constant guests' contact and that we privelege the personalized accompaniment - what distinguishes us and allows us a greater proximity to the diverse cultures.\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nQuatro amigos, muitos sonhos, um caminho em comum\r\n\r\nOporto Rental Management surgiu em 2015 pela vontade de quatro jovens amigos: a Rosa, a Tânia, o Igor e o Nuno. A ORM nasce da combinação das principais paixões dos seus fundadores: a cidade do Porto e as suas características culturais; a arquitetura e decoração; a gastronomia e fotografia e, acima de tudo, o contacto com diversas culturas. \r\n\r\nO projeto baseia-se no apoio e orientação de proprietários de imóveis localizados no centro da cidade que pretendam direcionar as suas casas para o mercado do turismo.\r\nEnvolve ainda a conceção e decoração destes mesmos espaços, conferindo-lhes desta forma, uma identidade única que se traduz na reação extremamente positiva dos nossos hóspedes. \r\nO nosso projeto culmina na gestão total do imóvel, que inclui a organização e a preparação destes espaços para o arrendamento turístico. \r\nAssim, com a nossa dedicação e trabalho diários temos vindo a conseguir conquistar todos quantos nos visitam e que demonstram a maior intenção de repetir as suas experiências com a nossa equipa. \r\nAcrescentamos ainda que além da gestão somos responsáveis pelo contacto constante com os nossos hóspedes e que prezamos o acompanhamento personalizado - o que nos distingue e nos permite uma maior proximidade com as diversas culturas.\r\n\r\n ","host_response_time":"within an hour","host_thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/849177cd-b74d-41e6-b4bd-3318da4c5fdd.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","host_picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/849177cd-b74d-41e6-b4bd-3318da4c5fdd.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","host_neighbourhood":"","host_response_rate":100,"host_is_superhost":true,"host_has_profile_pic":true,"host_identity_verified":true,"host_listings_count":35,"host_total_listings_count":35,"host_verifications":["email","phone","google","reviews","jumio","government_id"]},"address":{"street":"Porto, Porto, Portugal","suburb":"","government_area":"Cedofeita, Ildefonso, Sé, Miragaia, Nicolau, Vitória","market":"Porto","country":"Portugal","country_code":"PT","location":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-8.60858,41.1453],"is_location_exact":true}},"availability":{"availability_30":26,"availability_60":46,"availability_90":62,"availability_365":330},"review_scores":{"review_scores_accuracy":10,"review_scores_cleanliness":9,"review_scores_checkin":10,"review_scores_communication":10,"review_scores_location":10,"review_scores_value":9,"review_scores_rating":97},"reviews":[{"_id":"95588502","date":{"$date":"2016-08-20T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14574409","reviewer_id":"89078057","reviewer_name":"Alex","comments":"Appartement très bien situé , tout est neuf dans l'appartement et très propre ! \nIgor nous a très bien conseillé malgré une arrivée très tardive , avec des adresses de Resto géniales !

We were very pleased by the interior. Like Lander said before, the designers are really talented. We also liked that there were a lot of tools, glasses, bowls and plates available in the kitchen. The city was very charming but lively and full of activities at the same time. Our location in it was just terrific. In the morning and at sunset the view from our windows was a great surplus too. If we wanted to cool down on a hot day or just rest for a while the walk back was never long and that made every day very comfortable. The couch was nice and for sure big enough. The floor in the bathroom was probably our favorite part. \nWe would and will advice the city and your rental properties to our friends and family.\n\nA few minor point of feedback we think will help you to improve the place are the following:\n\nThe toilet seat lit fell of after a few days with no particular reason and the bottom part was very loose aswell. Secondly you should take a look at the middle window because the fixing part of the blinds was loose at the bottom. \nFurthermore the drain of the shower was clogged. We pulled out some hair, maybe of the people that were there before us.\nLastly the power shut down when we wanted to use the waterboiler and more than one heating plate at the same time while cooking. This wasn't a big deal because it was easy to acces the fuse box but we figured it would be helpful to bring you up to speed. \n\nWe hope our feedback will be useful!  \nKind regards\nLander \u0026 Annelie"},{"_id":"103563201","date":{"$date":"2016-09-23T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14574409","reviewer_id":"47401972","reviewer_name":"Sandrine","comments":"Nous avons été très bien accueillis, le logement est très bien situé, équipė correctement, par contre il faut savoir qu'actuellement il y a de gros travaux dans la rue, le groupe électrogène de la grue est sous les fenêtres, l'appartement est difficilement pratiquable de 9h a 12h et de 14h a 18h, du fait du bruit \r\nSinon tip top !!!!"},{"_id":"104025920","date":{"$date":"2016-09-25T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14574409","reviewer_id":"3650919","reviewer_name":"Mélissa","comments":"Logement vraiment agréable, dans un quartier bien situé pour visiter Porto à pieds.\r\nEquipement adapté et apparemment lumineux"},{"_id":"105060014","date":{"$date":"2016-09-30T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14574409","reviewer_id":"95671962","reviewer_name":"Josef","comments":"Liebe Rose, wir haben eine wunderbare Zeit im Apartment Cativo verbracht.

Selve lejligheden var flot indrettet og ren, det eneste vi manglede var en proptrækker, hvilket kan undre en i et land som portugal.\nLejligheden ligger centralt i gå afstand til de fleste ting i Porto og broen til den anden side af douro floden ligger næsten rundt om hjørnet.\n\nVi vil klart anbefale et ophold i lejligheden der føles som et rigtigt home away from home.\n\nTusind tak for en god service og et dejligt ORM!"},{"_id":"143490869","date":{"$date":"2017-04-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14574409","reviewer_id":"18658038","reviewer_name":"David","comments":"Apartamento increíblemente bonito y acogedor!

It’s also only a few minutes from the Sao Bento metro and train stations making it easy to reach the airport and explore outside the city.\n\nThe only negative during our stay was the significant noise disruption from the renovation work in the building next door. Noise from power tools would begin everyday at 08:00 and continue throughout the day until 18:00. ORM were very apologetic and did complain to the contractors.  They also kindly offered to move us to one of their other apartments. I’d recommend that guests ask ORM before booking to see if the renovation has finished.\n\nOnce those renovation works next door have finished this apartment will be perfect!\n"},{"_id":"151142739","date":{"$date":"2017-05-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14574409","reviewer_id":"7438713","reviewer_name":"Hafida","comments":"Notre séjour s'est très bien déroulé hormis des petits soucis de nuisance sonores dû à des touristes,voisins de palier, un peu trop bruyants à des heures tardives 3h du matin...

It is extremely tastefully and functionally furnished. We lived well, although I must mention the only drawback. If you want to relax (in the literal sense of the word), maybe you should choose another apartment from the ORM offer in a different location. Unfortunately, there is a pub on the ground floor of the neighboring building, and just below the window - a small square, where people party all night long, effectively preventing a good night's sleep. But if you want to party up to 3 in the morning or you're able to fall asleep amid the loud noises from the street - you will not find a better place in Porto; the flat looks exactly like in the pictures or even better :)"},{"_id":"260860839","date":{"$date":"2018-05-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14574409","reviewer_id":"8938683","reviewer_name":"Shahaf","comments":"Very central studio apartment , perfect for a couple visiting.

This made getting to the wine cellars and the beautiful view and restaurants by the water quick and easy. \n\nWhen I checked in Filipa showed me the place and walked me through all the restaurants and food I should try. I’ve found the food in Portugal to be very hit or miss, but the places she recommended were excellent! She clearly knew the local spots and it was the best food I had on my trip. She also gave me recommendations for things to see and do. ORM offers a special 15€ deal that includes a Port tasting and a boat ride on the water. This was a great deal and a very fun excursion for my friends and I.\n\nThe apartment was very clean with modern amenities and a beautiful interior. The view was also quite nice.  They were quick to respond with questions and very helpful.

Vous êtes dans le quartier des spectacles, au coeur de la vie artistique et des terrasses, mais on n'entend aucun bruit malgré la proximité de la dynamique rue St-Denis. Le lit est très confortable, l'endroit TRÈS propre. Vous venez l'été? Ventilateurs et air climatisé garantissent une nuit fraîche.   Le building est très sécuritaire avec un système de clefs moderne avec code à la porte. En bonus il y a un petit café à la sortie de l'immeuble. Fatigué? Envie de voir un film?

After years of doing hotels, I've decided to use Airbnb when I can.  I've heard great experiences and horrible experiences, so I was apprehensive once again.  I was so pleasantly surprised with Yves's place.  After a few hours of being in someone else living space, I felt very comfortable.  I didn't meet Yves, but check in and entry was very easy and convenient, which is what I need and want.  Great location..just minutes walk to one of the main transit stations.  Very cool location, and very clean, tidy and uncluttered loft with character.  Yves prepares for his guests, which was very welcoming and appreciated..... milk, juice, snacks, tea/coffee, essential toiletries, tourist/travel info, ....and for me wine.  For 4 days, I felt very comfortable in having my own personal space, which surpasses the hotel experience.  Thanks again, Yves"}]}

However, I had a couple issues with this trip. This is nothing against Raed or his place. Both the apartment and the host are great. Just a few logistical, subjective-comfort, and communication related things. \n\nWhen asking Raed about potential noise in the apartment, before I booked, he said \"this is all very subjective... it should be fine.\" When I got to the apartment, there was major construction (which begins at around (8-9AM) surrounding the apartment (the apartment is on a right angle on a major intersection near Place de Arts) and the music from nearby festivals (very loud) begins in the afternoon and ends late at night at around 11PM-12AM. \n\nI was aware of how close the festivals were, but based on Raed's comment, I figured it would be relatively quiet and didn't anticipate such loud music and construction. I was a bit annoyed when I got to the apartment and for the first few days, I was bombarded with construction early in the morning and then blaring music for most of the day. This may have been miscommunication, or maybe it is a new issue, but I felt somewhat misled. Now this might not bother anyone else, which is fine. But I did ask about the noise level before I booked. And yet, the experience I had wound up contradicting what I had been told by the host. So make sure you ask specific questions if you have specific concerns. And if you are looking for quiet during the day — good luck!\n\nThere was also some initial confusion when trying to book the apartment because the dates that were listed as available were not actually all available. In fact, I had to change my reservation from June 12-26 to June 12-20 because Raed had his own plans with the apartment from the 20th onward but this was not reflected on AirBnB and it wasn’t until after I booked my dates that I found out the the apartment wouldn’t be available after the 20th. This lack of clarity in communication was pretty inconvenient for me. Plus, I had to wait to hear back from and constantly inquire with Raed when trying to find out the actual available dates to see if the apartment was going to be available or not. Even after I booked, the dates listed as available remained inaccurate. If I didn't keep contacting him, I'm not sure how things would have turned out. This put a some stress on my travel plans, which were admittedly very last minute. I realize Raed was probably very busy, but it's always the little, logistical things that matter.\n\nDespite these relatively minor issues, I must state that Raed was very accommodating and responsive during my actual trip, very friendly, and in the end - he was very considerate by allowing me to check out a few days early.\n\nGreat apartment. Great host."},{"_id":"179451880","date":{"$date":"2017-08-07T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14649808","reviewer_id":"34507884","reviewer_name":"Philippe","comments":"The place is ideally located right on the Place des Arts and the flat itself is very enjoyable to live in.

You could honestly park your car and toss your transportation passes.  This place is close to everything.  The host was mostly responsive.  \n\nOnly issue I had was not having access to the rooftop for the entire 7 days I stayed.   The nice rooftop is included in the description for this place, so that was a major selling point for me to book the space, making it simply disappointing that I didn’t have access.  The host was not able to provide an answer on how to get acesss to the rooftop.   Finally, I booked the entire apartment, and it was listed as full apartment access.  The room you actually get is the smaller room with the bed that looks more slim and less comfortable.  I had a good rest in the room I slept in, but I assumed that having the apartment to myself would allow me to sleep in the nicer room that is actually pictured on the website.  Not sure why it is pictured if it is not available to potential guests.  \n\nOutside of those things, Raed was very quick to respond and good to work with.   \n\nI would return to this Airbnb, unless a place with proper rooftop access is available.  \n\nCheers"},{"_id":"311150050","date":{"$date":"2018-08-20T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14649808","reviewer_id":"155399472","reviewer_name":"Jt","comments":"Great setup, nice place."},{"_id":"314218761","date":{"$date":"2018-08-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14649808","reviewer_id":"3145885","reviewer_name":"Gaétan","comments":"Appartement bien situé, idéal pour un 1er séjour à Montréal."},{"_id":"317809887","date":{"$date":"2018-09-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14649808","reviewer_id":"16756775","reviewer_name":"Doug","comments":"I very much enjoyed my return to Montreal.

Las Ramblas is about a 25-30 minute walk, not necessarily close to the apartment. Our check out time was 11am yet they told us to leave at 9:30 because people were on their way to come to our room. They gave us a feeling that they just wanted the money, they charge 25 euros to get driven back and fourth from the airport but if you choose to stay at this house I would suggest to take the bus for 2.15 euros per person instead.

Our first night consisted of soft music played low on our phones and our 2nd night's noise was a quiet phone conversation, which was interrupted by a loud bang at the door from I  Esther. We essentially had to not make a single noise on our 3rd night to ensure we would remain in the apartment. I get that everyone has annoying neighbors who will complain about most things, but if that's the case, either let us know well in advance, or don't post your place on airbnb. Don't wait until the neighbors to put pressure on you to the point where you tell your guests they can't come back into the apartment and have to make other plans.\n\nAlso, take it from someone who's lived in Barcelona, this is certainly not the \"most cool area.\" Easy access to Placa Espanya is great, but for a more enjoyable time you would want to stay further into Eixample.\n\nNonetheless, they don't seem like bad people, just on edge because Barcelona doesn't like airbnb."},{"_id":"175256292","date":{"$date":"2017-07-28T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14661747","reviewer_id":"141025793","reviewer_name":"Nasser","comments":"Room very.

Eravamo in 4 ragazze, due sarebbero dovute restare nel B\u0026B di Esther e altre due in un altra stanza abdicata a 3 min a piedi in un altra stanza. Appena arrivate ci ha accolto Robert. Non parlava inglese ne spagnolo e ci ha dato il permesso di salire tutte e 4 perché gli abbiamo spiegato che avevamo una valigia comune che dovevamo aprire per dare le robe alle due ragazze che alloggiavano li. Arriva Esther, la padrona di casa. Senza neanche ascoltarci ha iniziato ad urlarci dietro come una matta che non dovevamo stare li tutte e 4. Abbiamo cercato di spiegare con tutta la calma possibile che solo DUE DI NOI DOVEVANO ALLOGGIARE nel suo B\u0026B. Eravamo salite tutte e 4 solo perché avevamo una valigia comune con le piastre dentro e le scarpe. Dovevamo solo dare alle due ragazze che dormivano ospiti nel B\u0026B le loro cose, dopo saremo andate. Ci ha accolto urlando che non potevamo stare lì tutte e quattro e ha zittito Robert che ci aveva permesso di salire per dividere la roba che si trovava nella valigia comune. Urlando e sbraitando, ci ha buttate fuori casa senza neanche ascoltare cosa avevamo da dirle!!! Così ci siamo trovate dalle 13 alle 17 di pomeriggio a cercare un appartamento in zona.

The room is around 6m2 and furniture is rather old and there were some issues with the water drainage in the toilet as water tends to remain on the tiles after shower.

The location is a bit of the path in Barra, but is very well known and a quick and cheap uber ride takes you to the beach and everywhere else. We had a lot of fun at the pool and cabanas, the restaurants outside the building a good and convenient, also a pharmacy and bakery right across the street. We will def stay here again on our next trip to Rio. The apt is spotless and has everything you need for a comfortable stay. Highly recommended."}]}

It’s a suburb many aspire to live in and once you’re there, there’s little reason to leave, with plenty of shops along Military Road, stunning scenery and even the iconic Taronga Zoo to keep you amused. Balmoral Beach offers a more relaxed atmosphere, with parks, swimming and beachside cafes. It’s tempting to stay at home and get lost in the harbour view from your balcony, but at some point it’s important to leave the house. A walk through Mosman is an excellent workout due to the inevitable hill-climbing challenges. There’s a community bus for short trips and plenty of buses into the CBD; or the ferry if you prefer a water crossing. Small clumps of village shops include delicatessens, bakeries and specialty gift stores, while the major shopping precinct is located on Military Road.","notes":"Bookings made via AirBNB are subject to the standard booking terms and conditions displayed on the Luxico Holiday Homes website.

Es amplio, cómodo, luminoso, en especial el living. Se encuentra intermediado por una empresa de alquileres temporarios (Ipanema Flats), Ana responde las consultas rápidamente, pero el contacto directo es a través de un encargado. Al llegar, uno de los aires acondicionados no funcionaba, se lo hicimos saber al encargado que inicialmente no reconoció ese desperfecto. Le escribimos a Ana y al otro día, el aire fue reemplazado satisfactoriamente y no tuvimos más problemas. En general, el departamento se encuentra en buenas condiciones, aunque tiene detalles que podrían mejorarse: el baño se encuentra -en relación con la foto de referencia- ya algo desgastado por el uso (en el piso, el mueble y los azulejos de la bañera), sería deseable una mejor disponibilidad en cuanto a la vajilla y utensilios de cocina; una de las puertas de un dormitorio no cierra bien y en el otro, hay un arreglo en la pared que no tiene pintura. La televisión y WIFI funcionaron sin problemas (aunque en una de las fotos figura una televisión en el dormitorio y eso no es así, se encuentra en el comedor). El edificio aunque antiguo se encuentra en muy buen estado y la atención de los porteros es impecable y siempre muy solícitos. Más allá de todos estos detalles, nuestra estadía fue confortable y cumplió con el objetivo de descanso, cubriendo nuestras expectativas, en especial debido a la ubicación del departamento, a camino entre las playas de Copacabana e Ipanema, con todo tipo de negocios disponibles, en un barrio tranquilo y agradable."},{"_id":"245775051","date":{"$date":"2018-03-23T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14741201","reviewer_id":"177674235","reviewer_name":"Glaucio","comments":"Para quem busca passar tempo de qualidade com amigos ou família ,decidir por este tipo de acomodação sem duvida foi a melhor decisão, nao esta demais mencionar que o apto tem tudo o que voce precisa, o lugar e aconchegante, e  bem decorado, bonito, a localização fantástica, sem duvidas voltaria me hospedar lá, recomendo."},{"_id":"260976746","date":{"$date":"2018-05-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14741201","reviewer_id":"183186716","reviewer_name":"Analía","comments":"Un departamento hermoso para alojarse en esa increíble ciudad.

Just two short blocks away from the J train and right across the street from the B-52 bus that takes you downtown Brooklyn. Also the B-47 bus, one block away, takes you straight to one of Brooklyn's famous malls Kings Plaza.  One of the best things is that it is very easy to get to many different places! B-47 or B-52, 38 to the malls, Q-24 to Queens, NY. The B-15, 7 blocks away, takes you straight to JFK airport.

You can get delicious sandwiches at nice cafes in the neighbourhood and enjoy good supper at an Indian restaurant. A laundry shop is 3 or 4 minute walk and the price is amazingly reasonable.

The house was spacious and airy and adorned in true Hawaiian style with gorgeous wood floors and furniture, and large lanais on every side. Morning and afternoons we spent lounging at the pool or on the main lanai overlooking the beautiful gardens, or wandering the many pathways near the house to explore the exotic trees and plants and smell the enchanting orchids. This is a true paradise away from the bustle of the beaches and Kona town, which are just moments away. We appreciated the seclusion and privacy after a busy day at Hapuna Beach, especially the outdoor shower and the large sliding wood doors opening the house to the cool air.  The gourmet kitchen had everything we could possibly need including high-end appliances, and with Costco and several other stores just minutes away it was easy to grab some groceries at the end of the day and enjoy relaxing cocktails and dinners on the lanai while watching the sunset. The house itself is spotless and the beds were dreamy; we slept well each night with the windows wide open. The library was a special place for quiet moments to peruse books on exploration and adventure, and gave a warm feel to the house and a personal connection to the owner. Hard to believe a better place can be found that is so close to town and the beaches and the airport, yet just moments up the hill is complete seclusion and relaxation. This is a true paradise and highly recommended for anyone looking for a luxury garden retreat!"},{"_id":"224868128","date":{"$date":"2018-01-04T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14758081","reviewer_id":"6931604","reviewer_name":"Anita","comments":"This is a truly unique and special home.

Perfect amount of space for my family of 6 and a gorgeous, lush setting for getting ready for my destination wedding in Kailua-Kona. It's ~15 minutes from downtown and at a higher elevation, so even though there was no AC, it was a solid 10 degrees cooler than the notoriously hot and humid coast in early August. Host was super responsive, informative, and accommodating and was quick about fixing a broken sliding door on the lanai. Tons of space (the grounds were especially big) with extra cots/sleeping pads that were actually pretty comfortable. And the plants/foliage! Definitely a highlight for us. It was so beautiful, and the more remote location gave the property a serene feel.\n\nTip: wear bug spray! Lots of mosquitoes, which really shouldn't have surprised us at all given how tropical the climate is. In addition, don't be surprised if you see some other bugs crawling around because that's pretty much inevitable.\n\nOverall, we absolutely loved our stay here and highly recommend it.

There was no “living room” with a couch but there was no false advertising at all in the ad, just something we thought might create more of a family atmosphere.

I guess the host got his money, and couldn't care less about his guests.

Lucky our 9yo child is a good sleeper. \r\n\r\nI didn't realise Steven was a smoker, and so the smell of the cigarette smoke in the apartment really affected us. The listing is correctly labelled, this was just an oversight on my part. The bathroom and kitchen were clean enough, but there was a fair amount of grime around the light switches and doors.

I wanted to go to Kurdistan but non of information was available in English he called the bus company for me and then he came with me to the bus terminal then he barganed on my behalf and I got a cheaper ticket as the result. He didn't leave until he made sure I went on my bus safely. In my return also his friend came with me to Taksim to make sure that I'm getting the right bus to Sabiha airport. I highly recommand him if you want a host who is also your tour guide and freind. Also the prices in the shops are considerably cheaper near his place rather than touristic area like Taksim and you are a 2 TL away from Taksim, so his place is ideal in any sense."},{"_id":"7968044","date":{"$date":"2013-10-10T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1476508","reviewer_id":"8926090","reviewer_name":"Oleg","comments":"Большое спасибо Кубилаю от всей нашей семьи за тёплый радушный приём, удивительную прогулку по Стамбулу, щедрость, внимательность и гостеприимство!

He even accompanied us twice on visits in the town to very beautiful places  in ortokoy and sultan ahmet. My mother and I really appreciated kubilay's kindness and stay.

Era ad accogliermi sorridente, mi ha offerto di mangiare. Inoltre ha parlato con il tassista che dall'aeroporto di portava a casa sua in modo da insegnargli la strada e non farmi imbrogliare. Inoltre mi ha messo in contatto in Italia con un ospite precedente che mi ha informato in modo splendido su quanto mi poteva essere necessario ed ha fatto da ponte traducendo a Kubilay alcune mie richieste. Insieme mi hanno assistito in modo molto carino ed efficiente. Inoltre il mio ospite mi ha fatto trovare al mattino una colazione superba andando in pasticceria a pigliare dei dolcetti. Mi ha accompagnato in città, insegnato i mezzi di trasporto dicendomi inoltre che per qualunque necessità avrei potuto contattarlo. E' stato molto gentile e discreto e anche una persona della mia età si è trovata a proprio agio. Anche per la partenza è stato disponibilissimo: ho dovuto alzarmi alle 3 di mattina e alle 4 mi ha chiamato un taxi per andare in aeroporto. Le prossime volte che tornerò ad Istambul, da sola o in compagnia gli chiederò di ospitarmi e consiglierò il suo nominativo a quanti fossero interessati. La casa è molto pulita, il riscaldamento efficiente, ed è a piano rialzato, quindi comoda anche quando si è stanchi per il lungo camminare. E' una persona discreta e disponibile.

What's more, he had made my first time in Istanbul an experience that I will cherish for a lifetime! We spent nights chatting in the living room while enjoying his famous home made tea and gormet snakes that his mother made. One day it was my birthday, he met me after work for dinner and took me to his \"secret base\" in TakSim. The place was very nice and I bet you can never find it just by yourself. There we were enjoying tea and Kurdish music, Kubilay taught me to play Persian chess. He explained the tips and tricks carefully and patiently and now I'm addicted to it! He took me for a walk to the peak where you get to see the skyline of whole Istanbul. We sat down and enjoyed the beautiful view while tasting tea... He knows lots of places that are not written in any of the travel guides. You shouldn't hesitate to ask him for suggestion. He is more than nice and kind. To me he is more like a long lost friend. You know, when you are alone in a foreign land, a host like Kubilay would not only ease all your anxieties and bring you a sense of safety, but also make the trip a meaningful experience. He has made Istanbul my home. There is no need to mention that he allowed me to use everything in his kitchen and insisted that I didn't need to wash them after use.

There aren't as many tourists and this lends to the advantage of exploring the city as a true local and paying less $ as opposed to the more touristic hub.\n\nThe apartment has everything you will ever need, and  for breakfast there are a million things to choose from! Kubilay is beyond generous allowing use and access to almost anything in the house.\rI felt as if I was staying at my friend’s home and  this is what he has since become, my friend. I was very well cared for and for this I am truly grateful. I ate most of my meals (the best food I’ve ever had in my life) with him,most of which he even paid for. He even took me along with his friend to catch some breathtaking views of the city and at night we discussed the best routes and places to visit the following day. He provided plasters for the blisters on my feet, on my departure he accompanied me to the bus stop and helped me with my heavy luggage.\r\n\r\nThere are countless other nice things he did for me and many other reasons why you should stay at this  Airbnb.

We were feeling at home and Istanbul didn’t seem to be so huge and unknown to us))) Kubilay helped us a lot, gave very helpful tips and even organized a special evening with watching whirling dervishes, it was really marvelous!)) Kubilay is not just a wonderful host, a man with the kindest heart and the most beautiful soul, but one of the greatest sights of Istanbul!) My 6 years old son is also impressed by staying in Kubilay’s flat))) everything was super-super!) thank you a lot!))"},{"_id":"368812719","date":{"$date":"2019-01-08T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1476508","reviewer_id":"73895197","reviewer_name":"Shahlo","comments":"War alles in Ordnung"},{"_id":"409240268","date":{"$date":"2019-02-07T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1476508","reviewer_id":"239993110","reviewer_name":"Спиридон","comments":"Very nice and hospitable guy!"}]}

Location is perfect, you can walk everywhere and the nearby tower (Torre de Clerigos) is a great landmark to help you find your way home at the end of the day.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. The apartment is equipped with everything you can possibly need, Raul has thought of anything a traveler may need, from a Porto guidebook, an adapter, an umbrella (which we made good use of!) hair dryer, coffee maker, extra blankets and towels etc. \r\n\r\n\r\n3. This is possibly the cleanest and tidiest apartment I have ever seen. Everything was beautifully set up, so clean, new and shiny! Yet the place has character and is well decorated. As other reviews mentioned, the rooftop terrace is  beautiful if it does not rain your entire trip of course! The apartment is very bright with lots of natural light and plenty of space to put your belongings and your suitcases. You could easily have three or four people stay here and still have room.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. The bed is very comfortable, and the bedding seemed new and even the towels smelled great!\r\n\r\n5. Raul is such a kind, helpful host, he helped us with the purchase of train tickets prior to our arrival, immediately answered any questions we had and even had Portuguese beer waiting for us in the fridge. He helped us get our bearings on a map and recommended many places too. Could not think of a nicer host!\r\n\r\n6. Things to be aware of depending on your circumstances; there is no elevator in the apartment building (you may need a hotel if this is an issue) and the hot water is not endless (as we are used to in some countries). The apartment is quiet in regards to street noise etc, however there are very noisy seagulls right by the windows. We used our earplugs so we were fine. We did want to shoot the seagulls by the last day though! They seem to never sleep....\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, despite the seagulls and short showers we LOVED our stay here. Don't even hesitate and just book Raul's place!

Available to our schedule, extremely helpful and took the time to annotate a map of all the worthwhile sites as well as his personal eating recommendations (worth following, very good!). This was the killer move: I asked him when we booked if he had any way of making an iphone connect to a stereo so we could listen to music, exchanged a few emails at the time and left it at that. When we arrived he showed me the brand new bluetooth portable speakers he'd specially bought for us! (They also work really well have great bass sounds for such small speakers).

De ontvangst was hartelijk inclusief een welkomstdrankje, goede uitleg over de woning en de apparatuur in huis, inclusief goede tips voor de bezienswaardigheden.\r\nDe ligging is perfect, vlak bij het fotografie museum en vlak bij het paleis van justitie ( met pin- automaat.)\r\nDe studio is recent verbouwd, dus alles is anno nu.\r\nMooi stucwerk, functionele keuken met vaatwasser.\r\nHet bed slaapt heerlijk, en van de omgeving hebben we weinig gehoord. De studio hebben we superschoon aangetroffen, en alles is aanwezig, zoals stofzuiger en andere schoonmaakhulpen.\r\n( we misten een trekkertje om de douchedeur droog te maken, maar wie doet dit?) \r\nDe houten luiken dienen als gordijn, waardoor je iets langer neigt door te slapen omdat het daglicht zich nauwelijks laat zien.\r\nHet is heerlijk om na een forse stadswandeling boven op het dakterras in het zonnetje te relaxen!!! Heel bijzonder bij deze studio.\r\nDe trap naar het dakterras vereist de nodige voorzichtigheid, maar dat spreekt eigenlijk voor zich. De studio bevindt zich tussen 2 kleine winkeltjes met levensmiddelen, dus voor kleine boodschapjes hoef je niet ver te lopen. In de straat zelf zijn 3 restaurantjes te vinden. In Porto spreken velen goed Engels, en zeker in de horeca kan je met de Engelse taal goed uit de voeten.. \r\nHeeft de studio ook nadelen? Nee, eigenlijk niet.\r\nAls we weer een bezoek zouden brengen aan Porto zouden we weer deze studio willen huren. Ook bij vrienden/kennissen zullen we dit appartement aanraden.  \r\nBelangrijk bij een bezoek aan Porto zijn je schoenen.\r\nneem goede wandelschoenen mee, want de straten zijn vaak steil, en de trappen zijn lang.\r\nEen cave bezoeken is een absolute must. Wij hebben het porthuis van Ferreira bezocht, op advies van de verhuurder.\r\nWij hebben ervoor gekozen om ook een middag te fietsen langs de rivier, naar het strand. We hebben gegeten in matosinhos, waar de barbeques gewoon op straat staan ( leuke belevenis )\r\nDe fietsen hebben wij gehuurd bij Vieguini, we werden goed geholpen!  \r\nKortom, Porto is veelzijdig, gastvrij en leuk om te doen en de studio is geweldig!"},{"_id":"66407150","date":{"$date":"2016-03-22T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1476656","reviewer_id":"35278899","reviewer_name":"Mathias","comments":"Indem er uns wie Familienmitglieder begrüßte."},{"_id":"67376033","date":{"$date":"2016-03-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1476656","reviewer_id":"8673911","reviewer_name":"Andrew","comments":"Had a great 3 days at Raul's place over Easter.

Raul was more than happy to answer any questions proir to our stay and when we arrived he was the perfect host! We cannot sing his praises enough! \r\nAs for the apartment it has everything you need; it is modern and clean which for us is very important. Although it is a studio apartment, it doesn't feel small as the kitchen has everything a large kitchen has (microwave, cooker, dishwasher, toaster, coffee maker etc). The wifi was really strong and the TV has lots of channels (English and Portuguese) and a DVD player with a few DVDs provided but you could bring your own. The bed was really comfortable with a selection of pillows. The best feature has to be the roof terrace, wow what a view! It has table and chairs, along with sun loungers and a shower. \r\nThe location is perfect too, it is minutes walk from shops, cafes, restaurants and tourist attractions. It is nice and quiet at night as it isn't next to any noisy bars etc, but if you wanted to experience the night life then it isn't far at all. \r\nWe would recommend Raul, as a host, and his apartment, along with Porto. \r\nThank you for everything Raul :) "},{"_id":"95423314","date":{"$date":"2016-08-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1476656","reviewer_id":"43356025","reviewer_name":"Celine","comments":"Je ne peux que confirmer les précédents commentaires : logement impeccable avec vue imprenable dans le centre historique, accueil irreprochable et très bon contact avec Raul depuis la réservation sur le net jusqu'à notre arrivée.

The apartment is spotless, very well-equipped and maintained, and feels a lot larger than its dimensions due to 3 huge windows which let in abundant natural light. The flat also features super high ceilings and some gorgeous inlaid stonework in the walls - it felt like living in a loft. I was instantly comfortable. \n\nThe roof deck, of course, speaks for itself. You'll watch the sunset over the Atlantic every night, a unique experience that I didn't see mentioned in any of the other reviews for this place and which I was truly not expecting. The views of the river and the opposite bank are second to none. \n\nThe place is situated in a lovely neighborhood just apart from the tourist hordes of Ribeira. I found myself sharing the sidewalks with true Porto natives rather than tourbus riders with selfie sticks. And there are some absolutely wonderful little restaurants and tapisco joints just steps down from your front door. The rest of this lovely city is immediately walkable beyond there. \n\nAnd of course the best part is having the opportunity to meet Raul, a thoroughly delightful and professional host who takes such evident pride in the apartment. As far as I'm concerned he's the gold standard for AirBnB hosts. \n\nI've had the great good luck to staying some truly phenomenal AirBnB places over the years - and I have to say that Raul's apartment now sits at the very top of that list."},{"_id":"195473506","date":{"$date":"2017-09-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1476656","reviewer_id":"72737747","reviewer_name":"Carmen","comments":"Grand studio au coeur de Porto à réserver les yeux fermés."},{"_id":"196156908","date":{"$date":"2017-09-22T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1476656","reviewer_id":"27949096","reviewer_name":"Américo","comments":"Best airbnb we ever went.

The house is really near the subway station and there is a grocery shop and laundromat near the station if you need anything. Takes around 45 mins-1 hr to reach manhattan midtown area, the roommates can get noisy at times and because I was staying in the room facing the street it was noisy as well on some nights where parties are held in the neighbourhood on public holidays. The room is has all the necessary things you need for a short stay, bathroom and kitchen is shared with other guests. Other than that, the hosts were really the highlight of my stay there, they were very nice people and I highly recommend you get this place if you don't mind the travelling time to manhatten.

I stayed with Silvia for five days, tried to cancel the fifth day before the check-in time, and was declined for no reason but got a lecture on opportunity cost (which I already knew from business school).\n\nThe room is not functional for anyone who wants to get some work done in the building as there is often noises outside during the day and night. Window seals are not tight (I got attacked by a mosquito in my room with the windows closed). The bathroom is small, inconvenient, well organized, and lacking in basic toiletries (toliet paper).

Must be noted this is a house that seems to have most if not all the rooms rented out, so you at the whim of the other guest. I had no issues, and was happy for what I paid for. Only issue I would say, is that if you coming to NYC as a tourist, its a bit far out. i.e. will generally take you 40min or more by subway to get from central Manhattan to the airbnb.

The apartment is spacious, reasonably clean, has comfortable beds with good quality cotton sheets. We felt it was a good value. The host cleaned the bathroom and changed bedsheets/towels after 3 days which was a nice gesture. We were always able to find street parking next to the house.\n\nOn the other hand, a few things did not sit well with us.\n\nTo start out, the host somewhat distrusted us. Lois requested to see the whole family upon arrival at 1 am before giving us keys, so I had to go to the car and pick up my sleeping daughter (5 years old)/wake up the boys 10 and 11 and then all of us had to spend 15 minutes listening to house rules (may be a better would be to just provide instructions on the Airbnb site like other hosts). \n\nThe bedroom was drafty, the wind coming through the window next to the bed was so strong that you could see the curtains move, even though windows were closed.\n\nThe master bed is placed on a pedestal - it can be seen in the pictures - that has sharp metal edges, it can be an issue for families with kids: my child fell off a bed and hurt his back on that metal edge.\n\nI also felt the hosts were not fully comfortable with families that have young children. Even during message exchange prior to arrival Lois indicated her concern about the kids being noisy. Upon our departure she sent a flurry of very emotional messages blaming us for a scratch on the counter and a chip in the enamel on the stove. We tried to explain that we were not doing anything that could have possibly caused that kind of damage. She said that it might have been our kids playing with sharp objects. \n\nFinally I was surprised to see the hosts storing a lot of their own items outside of \"private\" areas. There was a drum set by the kitchen, the fridge had a lot of hosts' food and there was a host suitcase next to one of the beds.

A couple things to note before you book, though: I didn't realize how far Staten Island is. My fault-- but it made for very long days during our trip. Yes, the ferry is free, but you will need to take a bus or Uber to the station. (There is a bus stop right around the corner, so this is easy, but does take 10ish minutes.) The ferry ride takes about 30 minutes. All in all, plan about 1 hour to get into or out of Manhattan. Second: Lois is not fooling around with rules. They are extremely strict about everything in the house manual, including no shoes, no using the desk unless you're a business traveler, etc. I completely understand why they're in place, but it's a lot to remember and just more intense than I have usually experienced at an AirBnb. I was very embarrassed when we forgot to take off our shoes for just a few minutes after returning late one night (it's easy to forget-- there aren't any seats in near the door), and we got a message (kindly) reminding we needed to take them off. Lastly, I was surprised to find that all of the cabinets, drawers, and fridge were full of the hosts' personal items. It was a little unclear where the boundaries were between what we could use and what we were supposed to leave alone, which was kind of stressful because after the shoes incident I was on high alert to be following the rules. There was a designated chest of drawers in the bedroom, but we weren't quite sure where we were supposed to put our bathroom or food items."},{"_id":"164812586","date":{"$date":"2017-06-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14804661","reviewer_id":"20450401","reviewer_name":"Amber","comments":"Wonderful place to stay!

Usually the checkout time is flexible, but for my case the owner didn't let me know in advance that I need to checkout earlier and it is very hectic for us to pack and call uber. Besides, we had few warning messages from the owner saying that our footsteps are too loud and we keep making noises in the middle of the night.

It is located in a very nice residential neighborhood which is a very short walk to the Sagrada Familia (one block across and two/three blocks down, 5mins walking).

Also, the apartment is 5 mins' walk away from La Sagrada Familia.\n\nBetween the the apartment to La Sagrda Familia there are many restaurants and bistros which are open throughout the day. On the same block to the apartment, there is a 'Pans and Company' sandwich/fast food shop.\n\nThere is a chain supermarket right outside the metro exit which is very convenient to get bottled water and groceries.

It's a relatively quiet beach where locals spend hours bathing in the sun. There is a park here with BBQs, toilets, changing rooms and a large grassy area to make a picnic. GREAT OCEAN WALK While you're in the area, you must take the Great Ocean Walk. It's a pathway that hugs the coast line all the way from Bondi to Coogee beach. Thankfully, it crosses your doorstep. Just join the throngs of people making the pilgrimage every day. SCULPTURES BY THE SEA Every year artists erect a series of sculptures along the Great Ocean Walk. It's a magical display set against the ocean views along the walk and it attracts thousands of local people and others from around the world. This year it is happening from 24 October - 10 November.","notes":"FREE BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE We want you to have a great time when you stay at our place. We like the idea of you sitting out on the balcony celebrating something and admiring the view. So, anyone that books for 3 nights or more will find a bottle of Veuve Cliquot in the fridge upon arrival. SAVING LIVES We are really thankful to live by the beach and it's a stunning beach. One of the things that makes this beach a great place to swim and have fun in summer are the lifesavers who volunteer their time to look after the people who use the beach. Chances are that you've chosen our place partly because of the beach out the front. So to thank the guys that look after the beach for us, 10% of everything that you pay to us will be given to them as a donation. It's the least we can do for the guys that keep the beach safe. We'll send you a copy of the receipt and any comments that we get from them in thanks.","transit":"BUSES The local area is serviced by buses that will take you to other transport hubs that will take you anywhere you need to go or you can catch a local bus directly to the CBD and be there in about 15 minutes. You'll have access to the internet from the computer set up for you in the apartment. Just either call 131500 and ask them for help or search 131500 on a search engine and you'll find a website showing all the timetables. You're not too far from anywhere!","access":"All guests will have free access to all the amenities and facilities in the Apartment. This includes a coffee machine, dishwasher, washing machine, dryer, 434 litre fridge, a complete library of books, 54\" TV \u0026 DVD Player, wireless broadband internet, sound system and an intercom / security system. TRANSPORT Once you arrive at The BEACHFRONT Apartment you probably won't want to leave. But should the need arise, there is transport immediately out the front. The #361 bus stop is across the ride and it will take you to Bondi Junction or Bondi Beach. From the Junction you can catch buses and trains to the city. The bus is handy, however, most things are within walking distance anyway.","interaction":"Unfortunately, we don't get to meet the guests. We leave keys outside in a 'lockbox' which allows you to collect them whenever you arrive.

We had a lunchtime BBQ with family from the city and were trying to take advantage of a beautiful spot but were interrupted on two occasions by the hosts driving to the apartment to tell our friends and family to leave the premises. We had no intention of breaching the six sleeper agreement and can't understand why a group of up to 15 people having a BBQ in the middle of the day is inappropriate or warrants the hosts' interruptions . If the hosts intended on being so strict with the number of people visiting, it would have made more sense for them to have advised us of their concerns when handing over the keys."},{"_id":"26777228","date":{"$date":"2015-02-19T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1481361","reviewer_id":"8890172","reviewer_name":"Pierre","comments":"We spent a week in Tamarama and it was wonderful !

Place was immaculate and wine and chocolates were waiting on our arrival.  Our holiday started off perfectly!  \r\n\r\nThen Mother Nature showed up.  Unfortunately, we happened to visit Sydney during \"the wettest April in 26 years\" according to news reports.  Winds were howling and there was even a hail storm.  Exciting, but not what anyone wants of plans for on vacation.  And nothing anyone could control.  \r\n\r\nWayne and Kate went out of their way to make sure we were safe and comfortable.  They checked in on us several times.  Made sure we had food (there were weather advisories, trees were down, Uber was overwhelmed, and we didn't have a car).  Loaned us their rain gear.  Even dropped off pastries.  No one could have predicted such wild weather conditions.  But we were determined to see Sydney and they were determined to make sure we were comfortable, dry, and safe.  Wayne and Kate went above and beyond to help make our holiday a resounding success even in the midst of a wild storm.  \r\n\r\nTheir spot in Tamarama is iddlic!  They have thought of everything.  Kitchen was well equipped and there was lots of reading available for those rainy days.  The views are more amazing in person.  The storm was fascinating to watch and the little beach cafe/park across the street is delightful.  Their apartment is on the coastal walk from Bondi to Coogee - loved this walk!  Fairly easy walk to Bondi (maybe not for a 3 year old or the elderly, but for most adults).  \r\n\r\nAs stated, weather can't be controlled of predicted.  But these two really went all out for us.  Their care and concern help make our trip so much more enjoyable.  I feel like we not only had a great vacation, but we made some friends.\r\n\r\nI would definitely recommend this apartment and these hosts!"},{"_id":"31139380","date":{"$date":"2015-05-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1481361","reviewer_id":"21630433","reviewer_name":"Vesa","comments":"The location is absolutely perfect!\r\n\r\nOther great things about this place:\r\n\u003e The shower had excellent water pressure\r\n\u003e The views were outstanding, we especially enjoyed watching the surfers and waves while eating breakfast in the study nook.\r\n\u003e The location was perfect for easy access to the beach and to coastal morning runs. \r\n\u003e The kitchen was well stocked with all the equipment one needed.\r\n\u003e The bed was very comfortable, and we enjoyed waking up to the sound of waves.\r\n"},{"_id":"31493087","date":{"$date":"2015-05-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1481361","reviewer_id":"25832809","reviewer_name":"Skye","comments":"After my original accommodation was cancelled 2 days prior to my wedding I urgently needed to find alternate accommodation for my bridal party.\nWayne and Kate made this possible.\nTheir apartment is clean, tidy and has all of those little bits and pieces that you need for a nice weekend away.\nThanks again guys!"},{"_id":"33080033","date":{"$date":"2015-05-25T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1481361","reviewer_id":"21574501","reviewer_name":"Andy","comments":"Had a fantastiic stay at Wayne and Kate's place. \r\n\r\nWe arrived on Friday night in windy and rainy conditions, but were soon cosy in the apartment with the girls snuggled in the provided blankets, and with the heaters on!\r\n\r\nEverything that we needed was provided for and the hosts quickly answered a couple of texts I sent with questions about the apartment. \r\n\r\nWaking up to blue skies and the sight of the ocean on the Saturday morning was awesome. \r\n\r\nWould love to come back and experience the place is summer! \r\n\r\nThanks to the hosts "},{"_id":"33915552","date":{"$date":"2015-06-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1481361","reviewer_id":"31054283","reviewer_name":"Deidre","comments":"We had a wonderful 'Girls' Weekend' at Tamarama.

It was perfect!!! The sunroom with its amazing view was the perfect place for hair and makeup to be done.  The apartment was spacious enough to give us all plenty of room and the relaxing vibe was just what we needed to keep us calm! The sound of the ocean and comfy beds ensured a great night's sleep.

The building is a serious disappointment.  Secondly the interior photography is selective in as much as it doesn't show details including aspects of disrepair.  The paint on the front door chipped and damaged, carpets are grubby and stained, the window coverings are damaged, their is rust on the internal hinges, windows fittings are corroded; laundry bench cracked,  all matters that can easily be addressed.  A major disappointment other then location.

We were all very happy with the apartment. \r\n\r\nThe location is excellent, within walking distance to many sites and there is a metro station at the corner if you need to go further. There is a nice little bakery just out the door and to the right and a 24 hour shop just across the road. There is an elevator, but it only takes 1/2 persons at the time. \r\n\r\nWe only had some very small issues with the power going out with use of the water-kettle. But the person meeting us at arrival spoke very little English so we got little information and the person we delivered the key to spoke no English. So we felt a little uncomfortable not having really spoken to anyone as we left. \r\n\r\nOtherwise we had a terrific time!

The apartment is absolutely beautiful, exactly as described, and finished to a very high standard.  Much more kitchen equipment than I expected and it really does have everything you could possibly need. Downsides are, lack of washing up liquid and toilet paper.  There was half a roll in the bathroom (for 2 people and 2 day stay) and enough washing up liquid for 3 meals. There is a nightclub directly across the road which was incredibly noisy until around 6am, not music but people gathered outside shouting, drinking and singing. This only happened on Friday night, Saturday night was quiet. Obviously out of Claudia's control, which is appreciated.

This way we did not have to worry about checking in or out at a specific time. It made check in / check out very smooth and hassle free. The one downside was that the hot water in the shower only lasted about 3 min. We just sucked it up and took really quick showers as we didn't want to go through the trouble of having the issue addressed, but the host was very responsive to all our communication so I'm sure she would have been happy to address the issue if we'd asked.

Allerdings hat die zentrale Lage natürlich den kleinen Nachteil, dass es viel Verkehrslärm gibt. Die Fenster sind aber gut gedämmt, so dass es mit geschlossenen Fenstern in Ordnung war.   \r\nDer Zugang zum Haus wird über einen Code geregelt, sodass wir keinen persönlichen Kontakt zu den Vermietern hatten.  Alles war aber bestens organisiert und die Vermieter haben immer sofort per Mail oder SMS reagiert, wenn es eine Frage zu klären gab.\r\nDie Vermieter waren auch so freundlich uns  früher als üblich einchecken zu lassen, weil die Wohnung an dem Tag schon frei war.\r\nGerne empfehlen wir diese Wohnung und die Vermieter weiter -  war alles bestens - kommen gerne wieder.

This apartment adequately satisfied our needs and the location can't be beat. Clean, good sized apartment for us. The shower has good water pressure and gets hot quickly. The space is also QUIET, which surprised me, given we're close to a street. This is due to good window coverings -- once the windows/doors were closed, we couldn't hear the outside. And it's air-conditioned, so we didn't need to leave them open, which we appreciated. The shutters on the windows also keep the room DARK -- so much so, that we had to crack the shutters open a little bit or we would have slept til noon! The bed is a double (important to note for us Americans..), and the mattress was firm, which I liked because I have back issues. Towels were decent size and quality, but no washcloth.

Additionally, the couches had some dust and hair on the surface, but was easy enough to wipe off. One other thing was we found spots on the sheets so wondered if these had been changed from the previous stay. \n\nOverall the apartment was nice and the pictures will give you and idea of the layout, however the apartment has wear and tear on it, such as scratches on the walls from suitcases/travelers, the pillows were a little flat (for my liking) and the light switches for the lamps were finicky.

Es handelt sich um ein Schlafzimmer mit einem Doppelbett, sowie ein Wohnzimmer mit einer Schlafcouch, einem Schlafsessel und einem Klappbett. Für drei Personen ist es super geeignet. Solange die Fenster geschlossen sind, ist es sehr ruhig für eine Stadtwohnung. Da eine Klimaanlage enthalten ist, kann man auch gut bei geschlossenen Fenstern schlafen. Einziges Manko war der Duschkopf, der dringend mal erneuert werden sollte, sowie die Handtücher, die uns nicht so richtig frisch vorkamen.

Another plus is how secure this place is, equipped with cameras in the lobby and the apartment door has a triple door bolt lock. The apartment itself is very standard and equips just good enough for what you need. Only complaint was how thin and cheap the pillows were, as well as blankets were (felt thin as a towel) and the actual bath towels were also very thin and rough.

The location is excellent and the room was private and quiet. We had a few bumps with checking in, but Jason the property manager was very quick to fix the problems and follow up with us when finished. FYI- the air conditioners are portable window units, so it can get very hot in the unit rather quickly if not turned on. The kitchen was fully stocked and we were even greeted with tea, cookies, and cold drinks in the fridge. Great amenities like candles, wifi, Netflix, and a double shower head (though the hot water tends to run out very fast that way). We also were directed to download an app which didn't seem entirely necessary (and pretty difficult on an island with limited service), as the same info was found in the confirmation email and by asking Jason for the wifi password. With all that, we'd definitely stay here again if we return to Kauai."},{"_id":"104474649","date":{"$date":"2016-09-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14855345","reviewer_id":"25550200","reviewer_name":"Junaid","comments":"Great experience"},{"_id":"106354410","date":{"$date":"2016-10-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14855345","reviewer_id":"33598657","reviewer_name":"Dirk","comments":"This home was a great place to stay and we enjoyed our time on the south shore immensely while here."},{"_id":"107241343","date":{"$date":"2016-10-09T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14855345","reviewer_id":"26539478","reviewer_name":"Joe","comments":"The place was fantastic and exactly how it was featured.

We enjoyed our stay here. Pros: This was a good location to the beach, restaurants, running paths and outdoor activities. The location felt safe; unit was clean; had coffee pods waiting for us to use, and water in the fridge. Cons: we never received a welcome packet, so there was no instructions for entry, internet use, or check out procedures; the AC was off when we arrived and took forever to cool down the unit; the bathroom smelled like sewer, which never diminished; washer and dryer situation was sketchy: one washer was inoperable, the other was partially taken apart; Kahea, the property manager was minimally responsive, and seemed annoyed when contacting her for entry and internet use instructions.

Also a 3min drive to the closest shopping center with food and general store. The house was also very clean with enough space for 3 ppl and maybe even more. Good kitchen but there were no cooking essentials - oils etc. \n\nBad part - I didn't know this property is on the 3rd floor and it was a hassle to bring our luggage up. Also, the condo does not have good ventilation so it gets hot very easily. We had to have the AC most of the time which was a bit loud. The property manager also warned us not to use the hair dryer when the ac is on. \n\nBesides that, the house had beach chairs, umbrella so it was great to not spend money on that. I liked this place but would have been great to have the disclaimer about the 3rd floor beforehand. Thanks for a great stay!"},{"_id":"116573224","date":{"$date":"2016-12-01T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14855345","reviewer_id":"18972631","reviewer_name":"Leah","comments":"Worked out ok, very close to the beach. Hated that we were told to download an app. I said I couldn't (or wouldn't) download it and was sent email directions for check-in, internet, etc which was much better. Check-in/internet/check-out was very easy and I didn't have any issues. There were beach towels, beach chairs, a cooler, basics for the kitchen like salt, oil, cooking spray, and a lot of cleaning supplies (we gave the place a once over to keep it neat during our stay and was nice to have all of that available to us). Area was safe, neighbors were friendly and was close to a lot of neat things to walk to. \r\n\r\nBecause of the name we counted the steps and its over 200 steps to the grass park BEFORE the beach for our 5'1 traveler and over 160 steps for our 6'3 traveler and that's is starting counting after you leave the 3rd floor condo and walk down stairs and to the street. We stopped counting at the grass because it wasn't close to 100. :)\r\n\r\nPersonally, I would not stay here again with 4 people because if you are going to the beach a lot there is no good place to hang up wet things to dry out for the next day. Parking is also not a lot of fun if there is a tenant in 8; its just harder to get out. Also, there was no table to eat at with family, just two counters for 2 people to sit at. And there is no coffee maker, there is a keurig but no actual coffee maker (we had two coffee snobs in our group so it mattered to them). Otherwise location was great and if those things (table, coffee maker, and a deck or place to hang wet things) don't matter to you its a great place to stay. \r\n\r\nI agree with other reviews that is was very very hot/stuffy when we got there. The main room is south facing and gets a lot of sun/heat especially if the windows are closed it gets extra stuffy. We stayed at a different location the week prior to this and it was always nice and cool with no AC. Here we needed the AC for the first 2 days, we tried without it and opening all the windows but the circulation wasn't great. Day 3 we felt we were on top of the stuffiness and in the evening turned it off and worked out great with windows open.

We were able to fit our pack and play crib easily into the bigger bedroom. It was a plus to have a tv in each room- and they were all equipped with Netflix, etc. it was just down the street from the beach and there is a small convenience store within a short walk. The views were beautiful and there were enough dishes and pots/pans to live and cook comfortably. One drawback was not having a dishwasher- so we had to hand wash everything after each meal. From other reviews, I expected trouble with he A/C. It wasn't a huge issue, but it was definitely very hot and humid by midday and into the night. We had the fans and all three A/C units running and by the middle of the night it was cold- we turned them off in the middle of the night and were comfortable through the morning of the next day. We used the laundry facilities- make sure you have quarters on hand when you go down there. Parking was a little tight as you are in the very last stall and wedged between a car behind and the building to your left- take caution when pulling in and out. We really appreciated the beach gear (umbrella, chairs, towels, cooler) available for guest use! Overall, we were very happy with our stay. My only real complaint Is that Kahea seemed preoccupied and was not good at responding to questions or concerns-  we didn't have any major concerns, but if we had, I would have been out of luck. She seems to be unavailable or unwilling to help guests after booking."},{"_id":"133324830","date":{"$date":"2017-02-21T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14855345","reviewer_id":"11743101","reviewer_name":"Dana","comments":"We loved our stay, and are sad to leave.

It had A/C and Tv's with internet in every room.  The Kitchen had everything you need to cook meals and had a coffee maker and a Keurig.  The location is prime and has multiple restaurants you can walk to in 2-10 minutes.  We rented a car but after a couple of days driving around came to realize we were on the best part of the Island and stayed at the Condo most the time.  The communication with the host was quick and easy.  There is a washer and dryer on site and shower to rinse off after you return from the beach.  They provided 2 laundry tabs, dish soap, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, beach towels, towels, and toilet paper.  They also had some 2 beach chairs, body boards, snorkel gear and some flippers.  You will not be disappointed at all.  I think my only caution would be to someone with conditions that would make going up and downs stairs an issue.  It is on the 3rd story of the complex but the view out the windows every morning and evening is worth the stairs."}]}

It's a few blocks from 23rd Street train station, which is convinient as you can take E train directly from JFK without transfers. Other metro stations are in walking distance as well. Super close to High Line and in very nice street block in Chelsea, very quiet which is not usuall for the busy NY. Great restaurants/bars in walking distance. \n\nHost is attentive, informative, and made sure that I have everything I need for my stay. Fast response. Easy to communicate. Keys pick up/drop off are easy. Accommodating. \n\nPlace is on a smaller side (well, it's NYC) but perfect for me as I was by myself. It has everythings I needed and nothing I didn't need. Comfy bed. Modern kitchen space to prepare coffee/food. Super clean. Lots of light during the day. Washer/dryer, which is kind of luxury in NYC. Bathtub to relax. Building is clean and quiet.

This is a high-end area of Chelsea with beautiful trees, beautiful people and beautiful cafes. It's been my second time booking this flat, and I have no regrets. \n\nThe host is fantastic. She is so accommodating, so polite and so friendly. She is always available over the phone / text/ email to answer all the questions and to give any recommendation on secret spots in NYC. She always makes me feel like I'm coming to visit my good friend's place who is out of town. \n\nHer place is well kept, spotless clean, modern and has an exposed brick wall for added character. The key pickup\u0026dropoff is super smooth and available 24/7. \n\nThis is great for a nomad like myself or a business traveler or even someone who wants to explore NY as a real New Yorker and avoid all the touristy spots yet be conveniently close to them. This is no large place but totally perfect for one person. \n\nThere are the best bagel place, lots of bakeries and coffee shops in the neighborhood. Also it's conveniently close to subway. And forgot to mention, it's just one block from High Line!!! One of the evening I stayed, I saw a famous producer at the restaurant close by - I know it's not about the listing but the neighborhood is so cool. \n\nLove it! Recommend it!

The apartment was exactly as described. Perfect for my needs. One the first floor, clean, adorable. It's small - but that's New York. It's perfect for a solo traveler - especially on there on business. I had everything I needed - a full kitchen, there was coffee and tea and other (more than) basic necessities already in the kitchen, a small fridge, coffee maker, toaster oven, even a microwave and a stovetop - and the most exciting part of all - a washing machine! Which in New York is as rare as a unicorn. I used the machine a few times, it's a washer and dryer and it was so helpful to be able to do laundry while I was in the city without having to send it out. Everything in the apartment is clean, and well designed. The bed was super comfortable. There is air conditioning and heat. The apartment is also very well stocked with everything you could possibly need. The area as adorable - lots of really great high quality restaurants and shops, a grocery store one block away, places to get your nails done - coffee shops, cafes, everything you need in New York. It is about a 5 minute walk away from the subway. Would stay here again in a heartbeat."},{"_id":"343701198","date":{"$date":"2018-11-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14858544","reviewer_id":"4386267","reviewer_name":"Brad","comments":"The apartment is super cute, clean, and cozy.

Gina's place in Chelsea was a cute, stylish little studio. The photos gave us a clear expectation of the space. There were dishes present for eating in, if we wanted. We enjoyed the coffee that was present for us in the mornings. Gina was quick to respond when I had questions before my visit. The hot water was immediate with the shower, and there were multiple shower toiletries available if needed. There was also a washer available with detergent and stain remover (which I did need at one point and was grateful for). The property is on the first floor, so the property has very easy access when bringing in luggage. There are several restaurants within a five minute walk (including a delicious bagel place around the corner where we had breakfast every day). The neighbors were also very quiet, we never heard anyone besides ourselves. And overall the property was very clean when were arrived. We never actually met or talked with Gina since she has efficiently set up check in to not require meeting anyone.\n\nThere were a few things that were not ideal. Sleeping was not very comfortable. You could feel the bars of the metal platform bed through the mattress, and the mattress was sinking in between the bars. The window also provides very little protection from the elements. We visited in February, and the city was very cold at night. There is a sheet of plastic and a towel taped against the window to try and block off the elements, but there was still a consistent breeze from outside that was most noticeable at night if you were unlucky enough to be the person sleeping on the window side of the bed. There were several heaters in the place, and that helped, but it caused one half of you to be hot while the other half facing the window was cold. We actually opted to head home one night early because we were eager to sleep in our own bed."}]}

I appreciate immensely that he contacted me several days before my arrival to arrange for key handover. The building is located in a very convenient spot -- eateries, transportation (7-min walk to closest MTR station, a few minutes away on foot from bus 5/5X that goes to Stanley Market or the 100-series buses on Wanchai Rd. that go to the Kowloon side using the tunnel and you'll arrive at Hunghom where you can take the MTR and trains to NWT and China; tramway, and lots of taxis). Despite the various problems re: cleanliness, Stephen was quick to arrange for his maid to show up more than once. And as other guests noted, hard to find a place so conveniently located at this price.\n\nCons: I would remove the \"newly\" word from the property's title of \"newly decorated apartment\". The cleaner obviously did a superficial job only--found dust and tissue bits below the bed and mouldy caulking around the bathroom sink. A working fridge was one of my must-have items, but was disappointed to find the fridge seal was extremely mouldy, including certain parts inside. I guess my biggest surprise is that this room is actually a room within an apartment which is subdivided into five rooms. There is no window as understood through other reviews and confirmation from Stephen, so won't be suitable for those who are claustrophobic, and you'll have to rely entirely on the air conditioning for fresh air. There is, however, a pseudo-window slot that is open to the corridor in the common area. Would have made the space much more homey if there were a small curtain covering this pseudo-window space since it is half-covered by a file folder and you can still see the dirty metal guard and the sheet of dirty plastic with a hole for the air cond. unit exhaust. I was much taken aback by this after seeing the more \"modern\" amenities, such as the cupboards and bathroom tiles. Another thing that bothered me was the absence of hooks for clothing, except for the three tiny adhesive hooks in the bathroom (but since the shower is in the same space as the toilet, one cannot use these tiny hooks for dry clothing anyways) and the bar on the glass door (but I didn't want to hang too much on it since the bar is against a glass door). Hence, the only chair in the space is hijacked by my clothes. So if you plan to stay there more than a week, you might find it inconvenient. \n\nAll in all, if you don't have a keen eye for cleanliness, you will like this place for its proximity to amenities and quick response from host.\n\nHint: If you arrive at the building by taxi, give the taxi driver the Wood Road address, but then you'll have to walk to the Heard Street entrance to enter the building since the security code doesn't work on the Wood Road entrance."},{"_id":"258943106","date":{"$date":"2018-04-30T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14875190","reviewer_id":"4303794","reviewer_name":"Egan","comments":"Thanks Stephen for the stay, its been great."},{"_id":"261776529","date":{"$date":"2018-05-07T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14875190","reviewer_id":"97748974","reviewer_name":"Elis","comments":"The location was good and there is convenient store located right below the apartment!
