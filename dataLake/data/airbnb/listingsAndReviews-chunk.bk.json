A supermarket can be reached by a short 3 minute walk.\nEntrance to the apartment is from a street level door, and the apartment is one floor up, reached by a staircase inside the building.\nThe apartment itself felt a bit like home. The wooden floors are creaky and a little bit worn in places, but not a problem at all, at least for me. There are also a few minor drops of paint on the floors, but again, not really a problem. The furniture is generally comfortable and the bedroom mattress is relatively firm. I really appreciated the light blocking curtains and blinds in the bedroom. I was not bothered by traffic noise from the street during my stay, and found the place quiet. What I also really appreciated about this apartment is how clean it was: Absolutely spotless! Also, communication with my host was flawless! Needed a hairdryer and got a reply immediately. And the hairdryer was delivered very soon after. And I got the same fast response and delivery when I couldn't find a can opener.\nAll in all,  I was very glad to stay in this apartment, and impressed by my host's swift and positive replies to my requests.\nI would be glad to stay in this apartment again the next time I vist Montreal."},{"_id":"338478156","date":{"$date":"2018-10-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"28782308","reviewer_id":"12972445","reviewer_name":"Sergine","comments":"Le logement était très bien et très propre tel que présenté dans l'annonce.

Paral.lel is an avenue that cuts down from picturesque Plaça Espanya right down to the World Trade Centre at the tip of the port. Poble Sec is an area spreading out from the middle of Paral.lel. The areas are safe and primarily residential but there is much entertainment to be had as well. This includes popular bars, theatre and even a club. However, whilst Paral.lel is a busy thoroughfare during the day, the areas are quiet and just a 10-20 minute walk to the centre of the city and Las Ramblas. A good choice if you want to be central but away from the crowds of tourists that populate more central areas. Montjuïc and Plaça Espanya are also very close by.

There are 3 lifts serving the block, 2 serving her level while 1 serves alternate levels.\n\nHer place is small, as expected like other place in Hong Kong. But amenities are completed with mini fridge, tv, cups, electric kettle, plenty of towels, pillows, blankets and shower gel/shampoo. Electronic door lock is installed, so we don't have to worry about losing the keys. The queen bed mattress is very comfortable and air-conditioning is adequate for us during October(it's quite a warm October for us) I slept on the sofa bed while my parents slept on the bed. There is no separate dry area in the showers due to the tight space. Heater is working but needs abit of getting used to.  I managed to make it work properly after some tries(it's those 2 hot/cold knobs type) Overall, it is quite comfortable, despite the small space for 3 pax. More recommended for 2pax. Very value for money during October convention period.

I am really happy to have stayed with some a warm, welcoming family. A wonderful AirBnb experience!

Als ich sie um die korrekte Erstattung bat, sagte sie, wir könnten auch gleich wieder gehen, sie habe die Preise erhöht und wir könnten froh sein, es zu dem Airbnb-Preis bekommen zu haben. \r\nNach dieser Diskussion war die Atmosphäre für uns so unerträglich, dass wir keinesfalls Sylvester dort verbringen wollten (abgesehen davon, dass die Wohnung nicht besonders sauber war) und am nächsten Tag das Zimmer wieder geräumt haben, natürlich ohne eine Erstattung ihrerseits.

I don’t know where to start from.. This stay was so special at so many levels. \n\nI ended up at Musa’s place because my previous host cancelled the booking while I was boarding my flight to Istanbul,  which happened to be the best part of this trip. \n\nMusa responded very quickly, and he even gave a discount. Throughout my stay Musa and Halim were very attentive and thoughtful. Not to forget their beautiful cat, Chizik! \n\nThough They are students but still their place is very clean and stylish. Very close to everything you need. Like literally everything. \n\nTransportation: Taksim Square/ Metro is 4-5 minutes walk away. The Tram (FINDIKLI Mimar Sinan University) is like 5 minutes by walk too.. Taxis are also available throughout the day and night near the main road.\n\nA grocery store and fruit shop is right outside the home. And some food/Restaurant are available 24hours. They can actually get things delivered at anytime in the night too.. even their kitchen has all amenities for using.. \n\nTo whom ever it may concern, If you are planning to go to Istanbul and If you are reading this, don’t think twice. Contact Musa now. You will enjoy your stay. \n\nPS: They are learning English but communicating with them was so easy. They really make effort to make your stay comfortable. Just ask them if you need anything, they’ll get it done.. And their kind intention is to make friends and learn about different cultures while they whole heartedly welcome you as their guests.. Enjoy!\n\nGuys! Çok çok teşekkur ederim !

Being just two of us, it was way more space than we needed...but no complaints about that! \r\nIt was wonderful to have a place like this to retire to in the evening after long days of walking around the city. Clean and modern, bright and airy, yet very homey. Very comfortable bed in the master suite with lots of natural light all throughout the entire place.  Beautiful modern bathroom with a lovely tub. I wish I had more time so I could have used it, but the shower was fantastic. Also a cute little powder room on the main level was very convenient. The design and aesthetic were consistently beautiful throughout the entire space, which really added to the peaceful serene ambiance. Absolutely beautiful and well equipped kitchen, looking out over a nice outdoor space with yard and deck. \r\n Although we did not meet Caroline she was extremely helpful and easy to get in touch with. Checking in and out was incredibly easy, there was lots of information left for us, as well as a bottle of wine, which was immensely appreciated when we arrived.\r\nThe only complaint I have is that I was not able to stay there longer, we did not want to leave!  I will definitely keep this place on my list for future trips, it really is the perfect place to stay in Montreal!"},{"_id":"23385887","date":{"$date":"2014-11-30T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2909689","reviewer_id":"3646142","reviewer_name":"Audrey","comments":"La maison était parfaite, telle que décrite!

Our two kids (ages 8 and 6) loved having the swing set out back, the bunk bed in one room and the trundle bed in the other, plus the toys and books, even in French! We liked having the piano to play on, too!\r\n\r\nThe kitchen, bathrooms, bedrooms, and laundry room are all well equipped (as befitting a European-style kitchen, the coffee maker is a French press), and the giant windows facing out back from upstairs and downstairs are fantastic. We appreciated having the gas grill to use out on the deck and the private back yard (though our kids were likely a bit noisy for the back yards all next to one another!).\r\n\r\nThe location could not be better! The house is on a quiet residential side street in the hip neighborhood of Le Plateau--it felt like French Brooklyn. It's a very short walk to the Mont-Royal metro stop and on the way home from the metro it's easy to stop at the supermarket en route back to the house to pick up whatever you need for dinner. There are also tons of low-key options when it comes to eating out, especially with kids. There are two Second Cup locations within blocks from the house--like a French Canadian Starbucks and our go-to coffee break spot. Also, there are two playgrounds nearby, and one is next to a public pool.\r\n\r\nHaving the metro nearby was excellent as nearly everything we did was no more than four or five stops away. We drove up via New York State and we were a little nervous about city street parking, but in the summer at least it was always easy to find parking on days you had to move the car for street cleaning. (It is definitely easier than in New York City!)\r\n\r\nWe so appreciate being able to use this family house as our home for a week and would come back again!"},{"_id":"156740713","date":{"$date":"2017-05-31T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2909689","reviewer_id":"43781539","reviewer_name":"Sarah","comments":"The host canceled this reservation 31 days before arrival.

In Ciutat Vella you can follow in the footsteps of ancient Romans, pray in Gothic churches reaching for the sky, stroll through the palaces built by the businessmen back from the colonies for their mistresses, follow the trail of the great Modernista architects and enjoy the most contemporary cultural offering in the city in the El Raval neighbourhood.","notes":"Tourist tax: €1.21 per adult and night with a maximum of 7 days.

It also has A/C, which of course, we didn't need at all during the winter, but if you plan to visit NYC during the --(very) hot summer days, you should really consider this, since it's very rare to find in New York.

They were incredibly welcoming and instantly treated me as one of their close friends. Inviting me in their inner circle and inviting me to come see the city with them. \n\nI think its important to note: THIS IS THE LARGEST SPACE IN NY OR BROOKLYN I HAVE EVER SEEN. The room is huge. There is TONS OF SPACE for living and kitchen cooking. And most of all.... THERE IS A GIANT BACKYARD TO GRILL.\n\nTHE LOCATION: its perfectly nuzzled up near the L train which is a 12min ride into the heart of the city of Manhattan. I don't know how anyone can pass this up. The price, community, and location is almost too good to be true.\n\nPlus if you stay there.... ask to try the famous Montoya hot sauce.

Maybe williamsburg is already famous as the ‘cool’ area, but the neighborhood itself is really cool, so many local pubs and restaurants a stone’s throw away from jon’s place (i personally liked the brooklyn star). The room is spacious, clean and located in the 1st floor. (My last stay in NY is in a 5th floor apartment with no lift, so jon’s place being in the ground floor is a godsend)\n\nEven when i didn’t have the chance to meet jon personally, he kept in touch via text and very helpful (so does his roomates)\n\nAll in all, the place and the host are great, super recommended."},{"_id":"240863408","date":{"$date":"2018-03-06T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2924834","reviewer_id":"21612179","reviewer_name":"Cristobal","comments":"Jon fue muy cordial y simpático, las instrucciones para mi llegada fueron perfectas.\nPrimero destacar la ubicación, a menos de 3 cuadras del metro más cercano, además en un barrio tranquilo.\nEl departamento compartido de Jon estaba muy bien, limpio y ordenado.

It is a residential neighborhood, with many young families and cute alleys  full of lurking cats. There is a very well stocked dépanneur (corner store) very close by (1 minute) where basic groceries, a few gourmet products, some vegan milks and a great selection of microbrewed beers are available. It is right next to a cute bakery. There is a pharmacy nearby, and some grocery stores 5 or 10 minutes away by foot. Montreal's iconic Plateau is just on the other side of the train tracks (don't worry—we can't hear the trains from the apartment). Along the track runs a great cycle path that is safe from traffic and wide enough to accommodate walkers, runners and bikers.

Wedad is a super conversationalist and also knowledgeable about the city and environs. We have stayed there a few times and have always enjoyed it."},{"_id":"318437640","date":{"$date":"2018-09-03T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2931473","reviewer_id":"129063531","reviewer_name":"Shane","comments":"First thing is Superhosts are that because they do things right to make a guest's stay pleasant and comfortable. Wedad went beyond that for me and I felt like I was actually in my own home for 11 days. Beside that, the space is clean and comfortable with enough privacy for anyone who needs it. The amenities can't be beat because everything I'd need in my own home was offered for my use.\nSome of the perks are the porch and terrace, a pergola and the heated pool beside it, plus the well-kept yard is right beside a green belt that contains gorgeous trails by the river for walking, sitting, or cycling. Also, Wedad is very personable and easy to have a conversation with if that's your thing. The value for the money was excellent!"},{"_id":"325751355","date":{"$date":"2018-09-20T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2931473","reviewer_id":"1467693","reviewer_name":"Martyn","comments":"Wedad is a fantastic hostess. She is very warm hearted and her spacious and tidy house is filled with her warmth and girlish joy. She has great depth and substance as well. Her house is in a quiet place with lots of nature around, and at the same time close to the bus stops that take you to the center. I stayed two weeks with her and am thankful for that time and I highly recommend staying with Wedad."}]}
