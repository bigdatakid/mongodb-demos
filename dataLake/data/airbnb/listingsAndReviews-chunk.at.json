Diesmal hatten wir leider Pech. \nDiese Unterkunft wÃ¼rde ich nicht nochmal buchen. Kurz vor Antritt der Reise war die Wohnung nicht mehr im Angebot, was mich wunderte. Man hatte mich beruhigt, aber jetzt kenne ich wohl den Grund. Gegen den Gastgeber Nuno kann man nichts sagen. Aber... Vielleicht sind meine AnsprÃ¼che was die Sauberkeit und den Zustand der Einrichtung betrifft zu hoch angesetzt. Das Wohnzimmer ist klein und ok. Die Schlafzimmer waren sauber und auch ok, aber keine MÃ¶glichkeit Kleidung abzulegen oder aufzuhÃ¤ngen. Dies gilt auch fÃ¼r die BÃ¤der. Das groÃe Bad hat schon bessere Zeiten gesehen. (Farbe an der Decke blÃ¤ttert ab und....) Das kleine Bad hat eine halbe Duschwanne (eine durchgeschnittene Duschwanne :) und ein WC mit kaputten Schwimmer. Dies scheint schon lÃ¤nger so zu sein. Mein Mann hat es tÃ¤glich wieder gÃ¤ngig gemacht. Und nun die KÃ¼che: Das Geschirr war sauber, aber alles andere ........ Die OberflÃ¤chen in den SchrÃ¤nken lÃ¶sen sich zum Teil ab und die Fronten im Griffbereich sowie die Griffe selbst waren regelrecht dreckig. Alles andere war auch nur oberflÃ¤chlich sauber. Kochen wollte ich da nicht. Was die LautstÃ¤rke betrifft, waren wir ja vorgewarnt....... StraÃenlÃ¤rm in den  Zimmer nach vorne  und das Zimmer zum Hof bekam den AufrÃ¤umlÃ¤rm vom Restaurant um Mitternacht zu hÃ¶ren. FÃ¼r Leute denen Sauberkeit und Ausstattung nicht so wichtig sind, ist die Wohnung sicher super.       \nIch schreibe so detailliert, weil ich die Wohnung nie gebucht hÃ¤tte, wenn ich das alles gewusst hÃ¤tte. Auch wenn der Preis relativ niedrig war, habe ich etwas Besseres  erwartet. Es wÃ¤re eine wunderbare Unterkunft, wenn sie renoviert wÃ¼rde und sauber wÃ¤re.

Expectations were not super high, I was just looking forward to a fun place and people to hang with, but the cleanliness and noise levels were unacceptable. \nThe room itself is nice and location is great but major issues were that the roommates came home at 3am two different nights being very loud and it was impossible to sleep because you can hear everything in the house. There was a dead coachroach at the bottom of the steps no one picked up for a day. The kitchen is super messy and disgusting. A roommate broke a glass on the kitchen floor and they just put a towel over some of it, and then kind of picked it the next day but there were shards everywhere still. I was crunching glass for the next 3 days under my shoes. The bathroom did not have a working light which made the other airbnb guest - yes they rent out another room- pee all over the seat because you can't see in the bathroom at night. \nI didn't meet Adrian, he wasn't there. The other 2 roommates are really nice guys, so I hate to leave this bad review, but it just sucked being in a super dirty house and then getting woken up and having to listen to drunk people be loud and obnoxious while you try to sleep in the middle of the night. If you don't care about dirty places, it might be fun to stay there if you are partying with the guys, but my experience was not good."},{"_id":"364988582","date":{"$date":"2018-12-31T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"20055551","reviewer_id":"104754516","reviewer_name":"SÃ¼ntje","comments":"The small room with the balcony is very nice.

All housemates (Adrian, Conor, Rhys and Alessandro) integrated me into their circle of friends and took me to cool places. \nThanks for becoming good friends and for the amazing times. Iâll miss you and visit you soon. :-)"}]}

This, in fact, is 1/2 of a basement on the 1/2 ground level. While the interior of the spaces matches the photos, what was not shown is the path that you have to walk thru to get to your basement apt entrance. After spending 10-15 min searching for a parking spot every night, you walk into a dark alley (about 10m), with smelly garbage dumped on both side of the alley. At / end of alley, turn left and you walk into 2 cars semi blocking the entrance to the basement units. There are woods and other dumps and garbage in the vicinity. There are spider webs that you will walk right into your face. You will have to squeeze thru 2 vehicles w/o dirtying your clothes before you get to  Ft dr #1. Unlock  dr #1, you walk into an unfinished hallway w/ woods piling in front of dr #2, which open into the basement apt. Imagine if you are dressed in some nice clothes, walking thru the above 3-4 times a day from the apt to yr car.  The place is very uncomfortable for following facts. 1. There is no bedboard, so you cannot sit up \u0026 read in bed. 2. The humidity in the unit is extremely high. There is a Dehumidifier put away in a small closet room, but we were not informed until we found it on the 2nd night. When i say extremely high, I meant you cannot even sit in the room w/o sweating. We use the dehumidifier (did not help much), and every 10 hrs or so, we need to empty a tank of water fr the dehumidifier tank before it overflows. 3. The outdoor temp at night after 9 pm during our stays (Aug 29-Sept 4) is \u003c 20c. But the inside temp is at 28c. With the humidity and heat, we did not sleep for \u003e 4 hrs per night. 4. On the 4th night, we found a fan (dusty and semi-working) in the closet room. It did little help after we have to wash off the dust on the fan. 5. We inform Ian that we are very uncomfortable \u0026 his reply was to buy a fan valued up to $40 and he will refund.  My message to Ian: Hi Ian. We are three nights into our stay and each night has been very uncomfortable. Even last night at 3am it was 28.5^C. Too warm, humid and hard to breathe. As we arenât even able to open a window. Outside was under 20C Is there anything you can do to make or stay more tolerable. In addition to the comfortability issues, I also wanted to note a few things that are broken: The dryer handle The coffee machine ---------- Ian reply : Hello, maybe you can buy a fan up to 40$ that I would refund you? I have photos, videos to support my claim. Message me on F/b if anyone want to see."},{"_id":"321916076","date":{"$date":"2018-09-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"20071164","reviewer_id":"212510503","reviewer_name":"Basil","comments":"Ian's place is great.

Too bad, because otherwise the location is very central (one can walk everywhere!) and the apartment comfortable. Also, don't be deceived by the word \"terraza\". The apartment has a terrace but it is more of a \"french door\" (a large window) rather than a terrace with place to sit. The apartment is on a second floor and in front there is a big building, which blocks the light from noon onward. The building is under renovation, so all windows are partially covered.

This was my first booking on AIRBNB and thought it was individuals renting a flat, and I thought there would be a welcome, some emails from them and possibly some items left in the flat. The day before we were due to arrive e, I got an email from Manuel and I confirmed we would arrive at 21.30. He told me there was a â¬35 late check in charge. When we arrived Manuel has sent a lady to meet us who was very helpful. I said we did not expect to pay to check in and the original booking h did not mention this fee and said as it was not agreed when I booked, I had not agreed it. Lucia called Manuel and we didn't have to pay it. We asked for 2 sets of keys, at first we were told no there was only 1 set. Then Manual suggested we make a second set at own expense, which I did not agree to. Then Lucia gave us her set and said that the cleaner had a 3rd set so not a problem for us to have 2 sets.\r\n\r\nThe apartment is small, bright and smart. The bathroom is cramped and the shower is up several steps ( probably 1 metre above the floor in the bathroom. The shower was hot and worked fine, although easy to get into not as easy to climb down out of.\r\nThe flat is on the second floor with a small balcony. It is on a busy street so traffic noise as you would expect, and occasional noise late at night as pepole walk by. \r\nGreat value at the price and located just off Paseig de Gracie,  close to shops and Casa Battle. \r\nI might not book a flat from Manuel in future, as at no time did we feel welcome, it just felt like a transaction / a contract, and not what Airbnb seems to suggest on their website.... that their renters meet you and make you welcome.  Lucia was welcoming,  even after 2 arguments we had with Manuel.\r\n\r\nMight just be easier to check into a hotel, no hassle with keys late check in andore facilities. I have rented apartments in over 10 cities and thus was the first time I used Airbnb, may also be th e last time !\r\n"},{"_id":"32718510","date":{"$date":"2015-05-20T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2019384","reviewer_id":"1927744","reviewer_name":"Trinity","comments":"The apartment in Eixample was the perfect location for our (too!) short trip to Barcelona.

The location is definitely the best thing about this apartment. It is very easy to get to all of the city attractions. The lighting is very dark in the apartment but we liked this anyway so not a big deal. One thing that was slightly annoying was the shower head not having a cradle to sit in. Although this is very minor, it would be good to have sorted in near future as showering while holding the shower head was a little difficult. Also a safe would be great for personal items i.e. passports and money etc but again not a major. We would definitely recommend this apartment to friends if they were traveling to Barcelona.

It made our trip!\r\nIt was my first time in Barcelona so I wasn't sure on the where the best location was but the location is fantastic.\r\nIt's at the top of the main strip, in a really lovely little street with some great cafes and restaurants. It's walkin distance to everything you could possibly want, but not on top of loads of tourists. The best part of this flat is how truely amazing the location is, I just cannot fault it.\r\nThe flat itself is great, it has high ceilings, a balcony big enough to sit on and a really nice block. \r\nManuel is great as well, really responsive and helpful. I was worried that the flat had no air con, but fans were provided which we didn't even ask for. \r\nThankyou Manuel for letting us stay, having such a great base in Barcelona made our trip even better. This was my first trip using air B and B and I will certainly be returning to this flat when I revisit Barcelona."},{"_id":"88751651","date":{"$date":"2016-07-25T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2019384","reviewer_id":"3075539","reviewer_name":"Nick","comments":"My wife and I had a lovely stay at Manuel's.

The apartment itself was just as advertised. Clean and modern with lots of natural light. Would definitely recommend if you're looking for a relatively quiet neighbourhood but still only a 10-15min short commute to the core of Barcelona. Just a small note, there is no AC in the unit, only fans. So at night time, it can sometimes get a bit warm although still manageable with the windows open."},{"_id":"93654380","date":{"$date":"2016-08-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2019384","reviewer_id":"16571942","reviewer_name":"Carlos","comments":"Perfecto!

The photos are a true reflection of the apartment with a spacious living area, double bed and small balcony. Communication regarding dropping our bags off was a little unclear (we had agreed midday and only ended up being able to leave them with a cleaner at 2.30), but once inside the apartment no issues arose. The location is within a two minute walk of Las Ramblas and two Metro Stations. The outside street is fairly noisy but this wasnt an issue with us and was to be expected with the location. Only minor downsides to the apartment are the small bathroom (which is split level) and small kitchen but everything you would need is there.

This is in a prime location for good restaurants and Gaudi designs (2 blocks from La Pedrera or Casa MilÃ , 20 minute walk to La Sagrada Familia). The biggest issues were paying 50 Euros when we first arrived (for a late check-in and city taxes; we knew we'd have to pay but it still felt like an attempt to get extra cash from us) and the poor cleanliness of the apartment. The pictures online are not accurate. Our room was on the principal floor, and we think there are other, better units managed by the host in the same building. The bathroom is incredibly small with the clothes washer positioned right at your feet if you are seated on the toilet (a tall person's knees will touch the washer). The bedroom is small and bare. There were no plants, no clothes dryer except a drying rack, almost no toiletries provided except hand soap, and some information on the listing is inaccurate (e.g., check-out time, self check-in is NOT possible).

Based on the information provided and the reviews it was a good stay but could be improved (3.7 out of 5 star). The place was clean. The location was good; about 10-20 minutes walk from most things. Check-in was easy although in my opinion could be improved in ways that I won't address. There are toiletries and the daily basic home stuff you could use. There is NO onsite parking but there are some lots for about 15 dollars/night that took me some time to find; an exact address of a parking lot would've been very helpful after a long 7 hours drive. The biggest concern for my boyfriend and I was the bed. The bed was too soft and sunk in (the middle of the bed) for our liking. It made our sleep very uncomfortable to the point we kept trying to move to the side to get the flat surface but would eventually end up back in the middle sunk in. I understand that it could've been due to the uses of it overtime. I think that it could easily be fixed by investing in a new mattress. Another thing that I noticed was all the bedding stuff and towels smelt like the febreze that was in the washroom. I'm not sure if the detergent used to wash has the same smell but that was what I noticed. Overall, it was a good first stay. Thank you Ish!"},{"_id":"316670409","date":{"$date":"2018-08-31T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"20214521","reviewer_id":"153817711","reviewer_name":"Alana","comments":"Ish, was an amazing host.

A good place for a few days. However, as some people have said, the bed is uncomfortable and sinks quite a lot in the middle. It would be good for a single person, but as a couple, it felt like we were falling in towards each other and made it difficult to sleep with our backs twisted. I understand beds sink over time, but it should probably be replaced. The shower curtain is a very thin material and it looks like it can tear easily so be careful when pulling it back. The floors are wood and tile, so if you visit in the winter be careful with your shoes and be mindful of the winter salt/melting snow. Also, for those not used to city living, there are two doors when entering the building, the first door must close before the second door can unlock. If the first door is held open or hasn't shut, the second won't open at all."},{"_id":"359903221","date":{"$date":"2018-12-18T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"20214521","reviewer_id":"227875548","reviewer_name":"Gab","comments":"would recommend!"},{"_id":"366898246","date":{"$date":"2019-01-03T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"20214521","reviewer_id":"124064814","reviewer_name":"David","comments":"Very nice place to stay, easy access.

Here are a few reasons why:\n\n1) Philip \u0026 Kawena were very quick to respond to any questions we had prior to booking the place. \n2) We were celebrating our Babymoon (honeymoon before our 1st child arrives) \u0026 the studio had the perfect space we needed. The place is conveniently set up for only 1-2 people! \n3) The studio was extremely clean. Linens and towels looked professionally folded. The details were impeccable.\n4) The AC was a big plus. Additionally to they provided us a fan which we used when we wanted to open the screen door to get some fresh air in or when we were cooking a meal.\n5) The kitchen was complete with everything we needed, including the rice cooker \u0026 utensils. \n6) The keyless entry - this made it very convenient for us to go in \u0026 out without having to look for a physical key.\n7) My own personal requests - a day or two before our trip, I asked if we could borrow a cooler and a beach umbrella ... before we arrived there, I got a message from Kawena and everything was set! We were so overwhelmed with gratitude. Along with the backpack beach chairs and beach towels.  Our trip would not have been as enjoyable without these accommodations. Plus, when we opened the freezer, a bag of ice was ready for us to take to the beach!\n9) The beach was walking distance too! Kailua and Lanikai Beach were only 5 mins away via driving. \n10) We had a designated parking spot!\n11) The Hawaiian Hospitality - our host's parents (Joe and his wife) were very cordial and greeted us with the biggest Aloha Greeting! They definitely made our Airbnb experience one of a kind!!!!\n\nThank you for this wonderful experience!!! We will cherish these memories forever. \n\nMahalo!!!

There is also an air conditioner, and a standing floor fan as well. I need a fan to sleep at night, so this was a huge plus for me. \n\nIt was a 5-10 minute drive from Whole Foods, gas stations, and the center of all the action in Kailua. Even Driving to Honolulu was very convenient, IMO.  Check out the health food store âDown To Earthâ. They have a few in different locations on the island. I ate there almost every day. They are a vegetarian/vegan organic health food store with an excellent hot bar and salad bar. It only took about 5-7 minutes from the apartment to get there. Gonna miss that store so much! \n\nThe views everywhere you go are just incredible. I was glad to have this little retreat to come home to and recharge every night. Iâm from a small town in South Carolina, so I prefer visiting big cities rather than living/staying in them. It was nice to escape the hustle and bustle of Honolulu and retreat to the apartment in the small town of Kailua. There is a dedicated parking space for the apartment in the driveway, so if you rent a car, you will always have a place to park.\n\nPhilipâs dad, Joe, met me outside as I pulled in on the first night. He was very friendly and welcoming. They felt like family, and I was sad to tell them goodbye. \n\nIt was a short drive from Kailua Beach Park, and about 15 minutes to Lanikai beach.  Kailua Beach Park was my favorite beach. be sure to check (Hidden by Airbnb) map reviews for the different beaches all over the island. \n\nThe house was on a main road, but I never heard traffic when I was there unless someone had super loud music or it was motorcycles zooming by at full throttle. It was cozy and felt very safe. This was the perfect place for my first visit to Hawaii. It was super clean and organized. Iâm glad I found it - I will recommend it to anybody I know thatâs considering visiting Oahu. I would come back for sure. \n\nCleanliness, comfort, location and price are what make this apartment worth booking. Mahalo, Philip for such a great place to stay. Aloha!"},{"_id":"345988335","date":{"$date":"2018-11-06T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"20228390","reviewer_id":"78788377","reviewer_name":"Meghan","comments":"What a beautiful place to stay! thank you so much to Joe for making us feel so comfortable!

So glad that we did not stay in Waikiki as the location was perfect for exploring all parts of the island (we had a rental car that made this possible). The studio was just the right size for the two of us- complete with everything but a full kitchen (which we didn't even need). Nice to have a fridge and microwave and basic utensils to heat up leftovers and make breakfast. Loved that we had beach towels, chairs and umbrella to take with us on outings and that there was a washer and dryer we could use. Philip's father in law, Joe was super friendly and made us feel very welcome in our air bnb. Yes, as other reviewers have said the house is located on a major street but we had our own parking spot on the driveway and we could not hear much noise at night time and slept well. The price is unbeatable! We would definitely recommend this place to any of our couple friends who are looking for a home away from home for a few days.

The place was clean, fresh linen, has a washer and dryer and refrigerator.  There was a Safeway grocery store and Burger King across the street, beach is a 10 mins walk.  \n\nMy only regret is that I didnât rent a car (my first time there so I underestimated how big the island was) so I caught the bus into Honolulu and rode Uber back at night (the bus stops running at 9ish in that area).  Great if you want to stay in a quiet neighborhood-sy area but definitely rent a car so you can easily get to other parts of the island.

Most of the time, you should find a spot street parking, nearby. Watch signage carefully, and avoid signs with red squares, which means you must be a resident with a permit / sticker in your window for that zone. Instead, look for zones with days of the week (DLMMJVS). Many drivers leave their cars and use public transit or BIXI Bikes. Private parking when available can be arranged in advance at a fee of about $25 / $30 per day. The bus station is at Berri/UQAM, with the exception of Megabus which is on St-Antoine closer to Bonaventure station (home to VIA Rail and Amtrak). Both are on the orange line, and BERRI/UQAM is a major artery for three lines, and is not far at all from your flat if you have the Shuttle drop you off their last as an option (keep in mind the shuttle makes stops at some hotels).

I initially chose this place because of the good location, reasonable price, and altogether excellent reviews. The location is indeed good, but everything from the first communications to checkout was extremely disappointing. For the checkin, the host told me I would meet one of his friends in Taksim. When I got there, I waited over half an hour, trying to reach the friend, until I called the host. He then told me to come straight to the apartment (rather than waiting for the friend at Taksim), which was another fifteen-minute walk away. I should mention that I've traveled to Istanbul before so I'm familiar with the area, but juggling my luggage and trying to find a route on my phone was quite a hassle. When I arrived, the host was brusque, unfriendly, and did not give me a chance to even survey the apartment. I would go on to discover that almost everything in the apartment was broken and covered in a noticeable layer of grime. The toilet cover was gone and the water wouldn't stop until I reached my hand in the back tank and pulled a lever; the pole holding up the shower head was snapped off; the kitchen sink effectively had two settings--steady drip and explosive deluge; the handles on the cupboards were broken; part of the floor was taped over; one of the stove tops was broken; and the washing machine door wouldn't close. Then there was the cleanliness issue: both the kitchen and bathroom sinks were constantly swarming with small flies, the shower was still covered in the last guest's hair, the utensils and other cooking materials were encrusted with old food, and the floor was coated in grime. I was barely able to stomach scrubbing and boiling the bare utensils I would need to survive, and I ate out as much as was feasible. The apartment also lacked toilet paper when I first arrived. The host did bring some over, but only a day after I contacted him about it. After a day or so of living there, I noticed that periodically a strong smell of sewage would permeate the entire room. Windows closed or opened, it was unavoidable. The host said he'd never had complaints of a bad smell before, but for me at least, it was impossible to miss. One day, the water was shut off--this was likely an issue for the entire neighborhood, but it's never happened to me during prior trips to Istanbul. Though it didn't bother me, potential guests should also be aware that you can hear EVERYTHING the people upstairs do. I seriously considered leaving the apartment early and finding another place to stay, but unfortunately this was not financially feasible. Lastly, I contacted the host more than 24 hours before I planned to move out to arrange where to leave the key and what..."},{"_id":"186257236","date":{"$date":"2017-08-24T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2023934","reviewer_id":"4290299","reviewer_name":"Laurent","comments":"Tres bon rapport confort/situation/prix pour Istanbul.

Close to shops, restaurants, and Istiklal street. It is a good 25 minute (with luggage) walk from either the Metro or where the Havabus shuttle drops you off. The flat also lacks A/C (I got used to it and the fan was invaluable) and it is about a three floor walk up, no television either, though youâll be out exploring! The area is more residential, quiet and comfortable. The laundry is great to have and the space is quite large. The kitchen is adequate, I only cooked breakfasts there. A local doner shop is a MUST: Durumzade. (The Ulfa kabob platter is excellent.) Also try local Turkish wine and beer, good stuff! Once you purchase an Istanbulkart, the metro is easy and great for getting to all the top sights. (Highly recommend since Sultanahmet, Grand Bazaar, etc. is a good 45 minute walk, at least.) The cruise of the Bosphorus Straight is also a MUST. Only 24 lira and it was the highlight of my trip. The flat great space away from the hustle and bustle.

Uncles, aunts and cousins doing God's work all over the world, people not principally interested in money. Not to say that I do not approve of wealth and power. My grandfather, after all, was a wealthy man, founding a watch company more than 100 years ago, but let your good fortune be applied for a good purpose. \r\n\r\nReligion, however, is too confusing for me to understand, so I stick to nature. This is my guide in life. And it has worked very well for me so far. For these reasons, science, culture, politics. social justice, economics and all the things that make this world go round are of great interest to me. I'm green politically, blue in many ways, my eyes, my jeans, my bathroom towels, my mood once in a while, blue is good, I feel fine. Red and black attracts me, but generally, I will try to keep a cool head. White is beautiful, but what or who is spotless? Yellow and orange are great, who does not like sunshine? But I prefer gold. And silver would be my blue. It suites me better. I'll tell you more at a later point. \r\n\r\nBlond originally, but most hair that remains on my body is in all other places than on my head. I shave off the rest, with some stubble remaining once in a while when I'm just too lazy. I am a mountain person, strong, agile, in good shape. Style? Always appropriate for the occasion. Quality is what matters.

From Waimea it takes about 20 minutes by car to get to the beach and 30 minutes to reach Hawi on the northernmost tip of the island, and just over an hour to get to the historic town of Hilo.  It is best to rent a car at the airport in Kailua-Kona.

You can reach stunning beaches within 20 mins. Airport of Kona is 1 hr away. Marie was very welcoming and really enjoying having guests even inviting us for a wine. We can recommend to stay with Marie on Big Island.

The local town has plenty of food options so there's no real need to cook, but Marie was kind enough to leave out snacks and microwaveable food. The suite is on the lowest floor of a 3 story home and although it doesn't have a view, and is set into the hill, it does have a little patio to sit on and enjoy a morning coffee. \n\nThe area is a great midway stop off if you're wanting to see a few spots up north and stay fairly central to them. We used it as a jumping off point to Hawi, Waipio, Mouna Kea and visiting a Vanilla farm. The town isn't huge but has some nice coffee and food spots. It's sometimes a bit rainy there, but that does mean we saw loads of rainbows, as sunshine is not far off.\n\nIs Marie offers you a coffee on her Lanai - say yes! She has a lovely view, friendly cat, and it was she's so friendly it's easy to get lost in conversation and forget you have day plans! \n\nI would definitely recommend Marie's place as a nice spot to stay in and visit the nearby area."},{"_id":"364556365","date":{"$date":"2018-12-30T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"20286842","reviewer_id":"17038407","reviewer_name":"Jason","comments":"Tootsie's Hideaway was one of the best, if not the best, Airbnb's I've stayed in.

When I arrived, the room was over 90 degrees and I found more than a dozen strands of hair in the shower and dozens of ants in the kitchen. When I told the host, she said this surprised her because the previous guest was very clean. Not sure why that would matter if hosts are supposed to clean up after each guest. \n\nI took photos of it all and said I wasn't comfortable staying there because of the condition of the room. This was the first time I've ever asked to cancel a reservation upon arriving. She wouldn't give a refund because she said it was too late for her to find someone else. Ultimately she seemed more concerned with making money than just human decency and cleanliness. This place also did not have a lock outside the room and it was clear someone went inside while I was gone (and without my consent). If I'm spending hard earned money on a vacation, I'd rather put it towards a business that values customer service. Throughout the ordeal, I found the host unpleasant to deal with and this was not how anyone should start their first trip to Hawaii.

First the good: Carol is a wonderful host, it's a great neighborhood, the place is bright, clean and centrally located - it's easy to get to town. The bad: It's painful to lock-up when going out. There are two entrances, a sliding door in the front and a side door in the back. Only the side door is lockable form the outside. To lock up, you need to exit the side door, walk down some steps around the back of the unit across the back yard, then around the other side and up a short but rather steep slope. There are what mayby were at some point steps. It's a rocky, narrow path around the side of the unit and up the slope. There is no handrail or a wall or anything to hold on to. Getting up was not an issue for me but getting down was a challenge (I'm not so young anymore). I expressed my concern to Carol and she told me It was safe to leave the sliding door unlocked when leaving and that no one had ever entered and taken anything. It is a very private space and no doubt very safe. But I was not comfortable leaving the unit unlocked. I travel with a fairly expensive laptop, if it were to be stolen, I don't want to tell the police \"no, officer I didn't lock the door\".

The location is wonderful -- 15 minutes to airport, 10 minutes to downtown Kona, 10 minutes to Costco,  no matter what part of the island you are exploring it is easy to get on the road that  you need to be on from this location. \n\nThe guesthouse is in a neighborhood, therefore \"neighborhood sounds\". If you are a light sleeper wear earplugs (I found the coqui sounds put me to sleep!). You can see the night sky from the windows and look at the stars from bed.

Great beaches all up and down, many with free parking and access. There is also a little beach right next door!\n\nBree was WONDERFUL and answered questions quickly. She was warm, friendly and professional in all of our communications. Excellent customer service!\n\nParking is free at Paki Maui and that was a huge plus.

The roof terrace is a winner, its huge - the views over the city rooftops are amazing - most places we looked at just had small balconies.  Its right in the centre of all the places we wanted to visit - and being only 4 mins walk from the airport bus stop was great after traveling.  The bakery next door was wonderful for breakfast and all the shops you could ever want to visit are on the doorstep. Its very modern inside and fairly well equipped -  enough utensils so that we could cook on a couple of evenings.  Having a lift was also a huge bonus being on the 5th floor! We had 3 sets of keys which was great, so we could go our separate ways is we wanted.The only slight problems were the size of the bathroom, but we managed and we were a party of 4 females! and the main bedroom which leads straight into the kitchen, no doors, but you get used to it!  Just one word of warning - be quiet in the apartment as the neighbours may have a moan! Overall we all had a fantastic time here, would love to return and would recommend it to anyone wanting to be in the thick of Barri Gotic.

Not very clean. Tiny toilet not lockable and clogged couldn't turn on the shower even to 50 percent blast we had to take out the filter in the shower to clean it. Very gross. Blood stains on sheets. Ikea cups were broken and glued on, when we tried to wash it it broke and cut the someone's  finger. Also no kettle. The mattress for the twin bed extremely thin the other couple had to take the ikea sofa bed (which was smaller) to put on the existing bed. No door on the master bedroom. This is a one bedroom. hazardous steps. To fit sufficient beds and dining table the owner squashed the dining room table so it was on the ledge. This is not very safe. Also we tripped on the internal stairs since there were bit's hanging out . Insufficient hot water for even 2 people (we had 4 staying luckily they prefer to shower in the morning). When we arrived the lady said a few mins this turned into 20 mins which is quite exhausting when you just arrived. And she didn't know how to use the utilities. She also didn't tell us how to take out the trash which was outside on streets. The clothes which were washed and hanging from you previous ppl fell on the ground and the lady said oh just leave it.\nAlso there was no battery for the air conditioning remotes. Lack of covers for the bed I had to use the blood stained covers.\n\nHowever great balcony and location and nice of the owner to put our luggage into their commercial office."},{"_id":"25569938","date":{"$date":"2015-01-19T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2029840","reviewer_id":"11824184","reviewer_name":"Simon","comments":"The appart is nice, clean et light.

Though the location was perfect for our trip agenda, there were a few issues with the apartment. On AirBNB, the apartment was advertised to sleep 5 people, however since the futon was inoperable - one of the guests had to sleep on the floor for all three nights. Moreover, there was a strong unpleasant odor in the apartment - not proven but just based on our own experience we thought could be mold since All 5 guests got sick while staying here. The strong odors coming from the apartment were obvious the moment we walked in until the time that we left. The apartment did not seem clean, and there was physical mold in the freezer. There were clothes hanging on the balcony from a previous persons stay. Also in the air bnb ad it does not note this is the top floor of a 5 floor walk up. There is an elevator but it is quite small. Overall, we wished for a clean stay and many of us became sick after staying in this apartment.

No logramos hablar con Ã©l hasta el Ãºltimo dÃ­a (y solo por telÃ©fono). Nos decepcionÃ³ bastante el servicio de dicha agencia.\r\n\r\n- Desde que entramos en el piso, notamos olores nauseabundos procedentes de las tuberÃ­as. AdemÃ¡s, el aire que sale del aparato de aire acondicionado huele muy mal, hasta tal punto que no pudimos ponerlo. AdemÃ¡s, estaba roto y salÃ­a agua, por lo que tuvimos que poner un cubo, con apenas espacio para sentarnos en la mesa.\r\n\r\n- Al llegar al piso nos encontramos sin papel higiÃ©nico, bolsas de basura ni papel de cocina (algo que consideramos bÃ¡sico a la hora de alquilar un piso). Tuvimos que comprar todo nosotros ya que no recibimos respuesta de la agencia hasta el dÃ­a siguiente. No entiendo para quÃ© pagamos servicio de limpieza si a nuestra llegada no hay nada de lo necesario y ademÃ¡s nos encontramos con toallas sucias tendidas en la terraza (que en la agencia nos dicen que usemos) y manchas en los cojines y las paredes (incluso una huella de perro).\r\n\r\n- Cuando nos recibieron en el piso, no nos mostraron cÃ³mo funcionaba nada. Tardamos media hora en averiguar como se abrÃ­a el sofÃ¡-cama; casi tiramos la toalla al pensar que estaba roto.\r\n\r\n- La cerradura de la puerta estÃ¡ rota y no podemos cerrar desde fuera ni desde dentro. Esto no nos hace ninguna gracia, ya que dejamos nuestras pertenencias en el piso. La puerta del baÃ±o tampoco cerraba.\r\n\r\n- La chica que nos dio las llaves nos pidiÃ³ 20 euros en concepto de tasas de turismo. Aunque esta tasa aparece marcada en AirBnb, no nos parece profesional de su parte el no avisar, ya que es la agencia la que cobra esta tasa y no AirBnb, y es una tasa propia de CataluÃ±a, no impuesta por AirBnb.\r\n\r\n- Las fotos que aparecen en la web son muy engaÃ±osas, ya que el piso parece muchÃ­simo mÃ¡s grande de lo que realmente es. No nos parece en ningÃºn caso un piso para 5 adultos, como mucho para una pareja con niÃ±os.\r\n\r\n- Solo hay un baÃ±o y es diminuto. Me parece vergonzoso que en la pÃ¡gina anuncien este piso como una vivienda para cinco personas.\r\n\r\n- Las vistas desde la terraza son penosas (solo antenas y terrazas en mal estado), mientras que en las fotos de la agencia aparecÃ­a una vista desde arriba, como si fuera desde la terraza, de la Plaza de CataluÃ±a.\r\n\r\nHemos estado ya en varias ocasiones en pisos alquilados con AirBnb y siempre hemos tenido gratas experiencias y nuestras expectativas se han visto superadas. Consideramos que el piso, tal como nos lo han presentado, no vale el precio que hemos pagado. \r\n\r\nPara terminar, los problemas causados han perjudicado en gran medida nuestra estancia en Barcelona.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"_id":"47617199","date":{"$date":"2015-09-21T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2029840","reviewer_id":"31368805","reviewer_name":"Carmen","comments":"MalgrÃ© des difficultÃ©s Ã  joindre notre hÃ´te, une personne est venue nous ouvrir la porte de l'appartement.

Having three apartments to spread our group of 11 across was a lifesaver! Emerald was courteous, responsive, and dedicated to creating an enjoyable guest experience. It is apparent that she is an experienced and competent property manager. On our second day we requested additional bedding and Emerald had her fiancee run them by before bedtime that night. The bathrooms were stocked with toiletries, towels, laundry detergent, and sunscreen. The bedrooms were clean with plenty of mirrors, which is a huge perk when you have seven teenage girls trying to get ready all at once. We occasionally felt a bit cramped in the sleeping spaces but that was due to our policy that students can't share beds. Large families, couples, and groups of friends would sleep very comfortably if some folks shared beds. The TVs and provided DVDs in the living rooms were awesome when the kids were winding down at night. There is no AC but the fans were super effective and we stayed cool and comfortable in the 80* heat.  The neighborhood is vibrant and active, and it is a short walk to a Safeway grocery store. There are tons of yummy and surprisingly affordable restaurants close to the listing. We recommend Konos, Da Ono, and Leonards (of course). We originally on using \"The Bus\" for transportation but we were stoked that Waikiki was a safe, easy, and quick (10-15 minute) walk from the apartments. The provided parking spots were a lifesaver when we rented a Jeep for a trip to Kailua. There are also a multitude of Lyfts available in this neighborhood so you could easily skip renting a car. The apartments are next to a main artery of the city and there is a bar across the street that was busy Thursday-Monday but Emerald prepped us about the possibility of neighborhood noise if we chose to sleep with the windows open. Between the earplugs we packed and the fans that Emerald provided noise was a non-issue, and we got a kick out of listening to the fun bands and karaoke singers while we relaxed on the balcony.

I also want to have my own kitchen to cook breakfast, a washing machine to do laundry (especially if you travel light - I don't!). Miguel's apartment met these expectations perfectly. It was comfortable (the bed especially), clean and looks like it does in the photos. The free Wifi was excellent and fast (and very useful).\r\n\r\nIts location is close enough to Barcelona city centre (La Rambla, PlaÃ§a de Catalunya) and being on Metro Line 1, you're no more than 4-5 stops away from any major sight, including the beach; and actually it's within walking distance of the Sagrada Familia, Torre Agbor and Glories shopping centre.\r\n\r\nWhat sealed it for me was the personal welcome gift from Miguel: some authentic Spanish chorizo (delicious), a couple of cold beers (again, very useful) and a bottle of Spanish bubbly. It's these personal touches that make staying in a place like Miguel's worth it. \r\n\r\nHighly recommended.

Nice for a short stay, but there are more lively neighborhoods to stay in in Barcelona. Not bad if you don't mind walking 10-30min to get to places. Definite caution as The shower is quite small if you are a bigger person. And lastly, the bed in the main bedroom was not comfortable. Overall I would recommend for a short stay, or overnight or just a waiting pad until you move to your next stay.

An even bigger plus was Miguel himself, very nice guy, left food and beers for us to start, waited outside for us in the cold between 7.30-8.30pm because of our flight which goes over and beyond what you'd expect. Apartment was very clean as well. That being said however, we wouldn't stay here again - only because the beds weren't comfortable and the Internet (for us anyway) was unreliable and we didn't have any other way of contacting the outside world without wifi. If these problems were fixed, the apartment would have been perfect. Side note: walls are pretty thin, you can hear everything in the apartment and everything outside.

It is found only in the last few days and a pity that did not know at the beginning, to be bathed in the sea every day. Recommendation - the description of the apartment to include this statement.\nWe, as a northerner, confused window layout inside the ventilation shaft, which was unusual, but just like the built Casa Battlo and Casa Mila, which we visited, and we gained the understanding that, in Spain, that building construction is common.\nWe want to join the recommendation on the size of the shower from previous visitors Miguel apartment - next bought a little more :)\n\nThanks for admission\nBest regards\nIlmars\n"},{"_id":"160504293","date":{"$date":"2017-06-14T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2031134","reviewer_id":"39332159","reviewer_name":"Naomi","comments":"A great flat in Barcelona, well located and easy to get around by bus or metro.

We had a slight hiccup upon check-in as the previous guests checked out late and the room was not quite ready at 2pm - however, this was well worth knowing that we had a clean and tidy room for our stay. As a whole the apartment was a perfect cozy fit for a 4 night stay: we enjoyed watching the Copa del Rey on the TV in the living room, the bathroom had a nice shower that had hot water that lasted for at least two consecutive people, and the kitchen seemed like it would hold up if we had decided to cook in. The building itself had a small amount of noise from neighbors but quited down by the time we were preparing for bed.

Culture could also mean indie music under the stars, a classy art walk, your first Cantonese opera â not to mention the exhibitions and events staged year-round at the many museums and concert halls.

(my apartment is on the 4th floor and higher - you won't smell anything from a restaurant on ground floor).  - In HK it's allowed to start refurbishments at any time without informing neighbors. Any noise complaints based on neighbours work in their apartment adjacent won't be accepted.)  - In case a lift would be out of order we cannot do more but informing and chasing the building","property_type":"Apartment","room_type":"Entire home/apt","bed_type":"Real Bed","minimum_nights":"2","maximum_nights":"1124","cancellation_policy":"strict_14_with_grace_period","last_scraped":{"$date":"2019-03-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"calendar_last_scraped":{"$date":"2019-03-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"first_review":{"$date":"2017-12-03T05:00:00.000Z"},"last_review":{"$date":"2019-02-14T05:00:00.000Z"},"accommodates":8,"bedrooms":3,"beds":4,"number_of_reviews":20,"bathrooms":{"$numberDecimal":"2.0"},"amenities":["TV","Cable TV","Wifi","Air conditioning","Kitchen","Paid parking off premises","Elevator","Heating","Family/kid friendly","Washer","Smoke detector","Carbon monoxide detector","First aid kit","Safety card","Fire extinguisher","Essentials","Shampoo","Lock on bedroom door","Hangers","Hair dryer","Iron","Laptop friendly workspace","Private living room","Private entrance","Outlet covers","High chair","Babysitter recommendations","Crib","Room-darkening shades","Game console","Hot water","Bed linens","Extra pillows and blankets","Microwave","Coffee maker","Refrigerator","Dishwasher","Dishes and silverware","Cooking basics","Stove","Single level home","Luggage dropoff allowed","Long term stays allowed","Wide hallway clearance","Step-free access","Flat path to front door","Well-lit path to entrance","Step-free access","Step-free access","Host greets you"],"price":{"$numberDecimal":"1492.00"},"security_deposit":{"$numberDecimal":"1570.00"},"cleaning_fee":{"$numberDecimal":"942.00"},"extra_people":{"$numberDecimal":"79.00"},"guests_included":{"$numberDecimal":"1"},"images":{"thumbnail_url":"","medium_url":"","picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/3d750e11-3969-49fc-80ad-6070200599d3.jpg?aki_policy=large","xl_picture_url":""},"host":{"host_id":"102984683","host_url":"https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/102984683","host_name":"Shan","host_location":"Hong Kong","host_about":"Hello,  \r\n\r\nmy name is Shan, I am a proud mother of twins, born in Singapore and enjoying the huge advantage of having Hong Kong and Bali as amazing destinations so close by. \r\n\r\nI discovered skills in creating jewelry with materials like carbon and fabrics...wish me luck for my own little brand. \r\n\r\nMe and my husband handpicked well located apartment  and luxurious Villas so that we can offer you the best experiences in Hong Kong and Bali. \r\n\r\nWhether you are traveling with family or friends I  want to  impress you with  preferable locations in Hong Kong, a high standard of amenities and exceptional services in Bali.\r\n\r\n It is my pleasure to be able to share our properties - enjoy the ready made individually designed places, take in the wonders and hidden treasures of these always exciting and surprising islands.  \r\n\r\nI  look forward to welcoming you soon... don't hesitate to get in touch!

First of all, the guest manager wasnât there when we arrived, so he asked his assistant to open the door for us! The lady wasnât nice at all, she was different in a bad mood, we didnât feel welcomed at all!  The apartment building is like the oldest building ever, I have not seen anything like that, so old and so poor! I donât even know how to describe the hallway, smells and sticks! Once we enter the apartment, OMG, the smell was even worse! Itâs a very strong bad perfume smell that made all of us headache! I asked the lady and she said they cleaned the apartment right before we arrive, the smell will be gone soon and we believed her so we went out to dinner! When we came back in two hours, the disgusting smell is Still there! We have opened all the windows and still couldnât get rid off the smell! This is not the worst part! The apartment was not clean at all, got spots on the bed sheets, the sofa was so dirty and donât get me start with the kitchenware and dishes! It took me one hour to wash them before I can even touch them! There were so dirty! I didnât pay this amount of money to come clean your apartment for you! When we try the use the shower, the water is so blocked that dirty water will not go down! And the bathrooms are the smallest bathrooms that I have ever seen, and the picture showed on airbnb is a fake picture! We checked out the very first thing in the morning, and with all my heart, even a three stars hotel would have a better experience than this!"},{"_id":"337936605","date":{"$date":"2018-10-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"20362690","reviewer_id":"7244807","reviewer_name":"Reid","comments":"Great apartment great location.

Consulates general and consulates of many countries are also located in this area, as is Government Hill, the site of the government headquarters. The area, with its proximity to Victoria Harbour, has served as the centre of trade and financial activities from the earliest days of the British colonial era in 1841, and continues to flourish and serve as the place of administration after the transfer of sovereignty to China in 1997.

No space to put cloths, the two queen size beds you see are covering up any form of closet. No Dresser. On the plus, the air conditioning works. The beds are decent. The room was clean and sheets and towels nice. You are in Hawaii!  Parking is 25 a night in addition to the room cost. There is no other way to park so take that into account. The host seems like a very nice lady but only speaks Chinese so communication is tough. My check in was not smooth wasting 45 minutes to get in as she did not provide lock box # and no english. She also promised me 13 days refund but only refunded half of it.  Just observe she has a strict cancelation policy with AirBNB so she technically cannot give you a refund. And my advise is do not accept her word if she tells you she will because she broke her promise to me."},{"_id":"194080266","date":{"$date":"2017-09-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"20413840","reviewer_id":"58215052","reviewer_name":"Alex","comments":"Yuk was amazing I got the opportunity to talk with Yuk husband and daughter all of them are nice, Yuk left some gifts for us and always responded to me nicely, the room was great located and everything you need is located in the lobby from booking tours, car rental, chairs, snorkeling gear coolers, coffee shop grocery store, restaurants, bar, nightclub I mean everything. The only problem is the price of the parking $25 dollars per night extra and that's nothing you can do unless you can find a parking on the streets near by but you have to make sure you read the signs and understand them. Other places usually charge $30+ for parking so $25 that's actually cheap.

She had plenty of kitchen tools and had everything you needed.  \nIf you donât mind the most fancy place this was a great stay\nThe most important thing to me about this place was it was QUIET. Which is hard to come by in a town like Waikiki.  Just the way the rooms are build we barely heard our neighbors and it was on a high enough level that you couldnât hear any street noise. \nTo me that is the most priceless aspect of a stay.

We enjoy the experience because staying at a vacation rental gives one a sense of the character of the city and people you are visiting -- something you don't get from the \"sterility\" of the hotel stay.  In that light, we are proud to be able to offer our guests an opportunity to stay in an apartment that is typical of the sort built after the war to accomodate the returning service men and their families.  The neighborhood is very much residential and varied in population age wise and linguistically.  It is only a block away from a major commerical artery and very close to the metro system.\r\n\r\n About myself, I am a biologist who now works in education at a College in downtown montreal.  While I am very much anchored in the scientific mind set, my reading pleasure invariably centers around history -- mostly western civilization -- and art.   We enjoy living in Montreal because of its cultural richness, and benefit from all the opportunites ranging from theatre productions to museum exhibits, etc.  We also enjoy hiking through the Laurentians and the richness of the environment that surrounds Montreal, which is not that far away.\r\n\r\nWhether you come to stay here or not, I think you will enjoy visiting this unique city in the North America.

It can get a little loud at night in the street outside the bedroom windows but other than that you cannot fault it. The greatest part of staying here though is the hospitality. Filipes friend Joao welcomed us with a smile and a whole range of really great information - but went over and above when I realised I had left my passport in the taxi - ringing the taxi company and airport police and dealing with them for me until it was found. The excellent communication and support from both Joao and Filipe before, during and after our stay was second to none.

We were charged for part of a second day stay despite no information on the listing about a minimum stay and also charged extra because of the 'holiday weekend' when Memorial Day is not celebrated in Canada. I would not recommend the property I stayed in or liaising with Stewie to anyone I know.

Cose positive: vicinissimo alla metro fermata Heroismo (attraversi la strada e c'Ã¨ la fermata della metro, passano molte linee che portano a Trindad dove puoi cambiare per andare in centro), stanza per 5 economica, poi si trova sopra a una pasticceria-panificio molto buona e con buoni prezzi, infine abbiamo potuto lasciare la camera all'orario che volevamo. Cose negative: non c'Ã¨ il citofono e il campanello sulla strada non funziona per cui per contattare l'host bisogna solo inviare i messaggi per farsi aprire. Entrando c'Ã¨ un \"profumino\" di cucinato 24 ore su 24, la camera non Ã¨ per niente profumata, anzi..., cosÃ¬ anche le lenzuola e le asciugamani. I letti non sono fatti, c'Ã¨ solo il lenzuolo di sotto mentre quello di sopra e le coperte (piuttosto vecchie e polverose, una sporca) sono appoggiati. C'Ã¨ solo un asciugamano a testa. In bagno non c'Ã¨ sapone per le mani, bagnoschiuma e shampoo lasciati probabilmente degli ospiti precedenti. La cosa piÃ¹ grave Ã¨ che la porta della nostra stanza non si poteva chiudere a chiave perchÃ© non c'era la chiave. L'host (di poche parole) non aveva neanche una cartina da darci. Gli infissi sono scorrevoli e fanno entrare aria. Ultima cosa: il WiFi non era sufficientemente potente da funzionare."},{"_id":"222237215","date":{"$date":"2017-12-29T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"20478290","reviewer_id":"70951605","reviewer_name":"Victoria","comments":"Hicimos una reserva en esta habitaciÃ³n para alojarnos el mismo dÃ­a. \n\nTuvimos un problema de comunicaciÃ³n y no fueron nada accesibles con la hora de llegada, por lo que no pudimos alojarnos en la habitaciÃ³n aÃºn cuando estaba todo pago.

The kitchen inside our apartment was also stocked with basic supply of spices, pots and pans. The apartment itself was very nice and compact for the two of us. We used the AC only for a couple of hours at night, otherwise the ceiling fans were enough to keep the place ventilated during our trip in October. We will definitely come back to Poipu plantation on our next trip to Kauai!

Very quiet at night and filled with tropical bird calls in the morning. The location is wonderful...steps to a wonderful beach, known for snorkeling, surfing, and sea turtles! Very comfortable in the one bedroom villa that I stayed in for four nights. Enjoyed the kitchen for breakfasts and packing picnics. Nice to have cool drinks and snacks to return to, after an adventurous day. Woman at the check in desk was friendly and helpful. Appreciated the suggestion to borrow a beach chair and towel to keep in the car along with a small cooler while I toured the island. Will return!"}]}

This is a bit of a drawback for gentrification issues in the neighborhood and in general because if problems arise with other guests there is nobody there to directly solve them. That said, the contact (messaging) with Laura was very fast and uncomplicated both before and during my stay, so although we met only once (and only briefly) in person, I consider Laura as a very reliable and accommodating host. The room I was given was very small, but clean and with a good mattress. I was very happy with my choice. The common rooms â kitchen, bathrooms and living room â are cleaned daily. Wifi access is only in kitchen and living room, not in the upstairs rooms. The neighborhood is stunning and the house is at short walking distance to different subways.

Communication with lay was great! Specific and very fast.\nIn the house you'll live with other travelers and the cleanliness of the shared rooms mostly relies on everyone cleaning up after himself. Which unfortunately not everyone does. Our bathroom during the stay was covered with long hair and someone didn't know how to use a toilet properly. The kitchen though was always clean.\nThe room itself was little but quite ok. The floors needed some vacuuming and although the bed smelled fresh, we found multiple hairs, that didn't belong to us. All by myself I couldn't have looked the room door, because it was not hanging straight. My boyfriend had to lift it, so the lock would snap. Underneath the doors is a hand wide gap to the floor. Didn't give us a feel of privacy and you have to expect to hear your fellow floor mates' conversations or Netflix shows."},{"_id":"202735223","date":{"$date":"2017-10-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"20530001","reviewer_id":"15370325","reviewer_name":"Kevin","comments":"My girlfriend and I stayed at this place for 8 nights and we would definitely recommend it.

Compared to other New York apartments this one is modern and quite spacious, cause you have full access to a living room and the kitchen. A big plus for me was the fact that this apartment has got 4 bathrooms, so at least one was always available. Besides you always get to know other people, because all of the rooms (I guess it was 8 or 9 in total) are rented out.

I would caution that the water gets extremely hot really fast, so be careful not to burn yourself! I didnât interact with Lay much, but when we did see her she was friendly and helpful. Great value for the price. The subway was only a short walk away so we were able to get to manhattan and elsewhere very easily and quickly.

The room is quite small but I was pleasantly surprised by how quiet the street was at night and never felt unsafe in the area (as a young woman alone). The walk to the subway is easy and there are a lot of cute cafes nearby. When I said I was having trouble closing the window in the room, someone came to help me within an hour (which was impressive, in my opinion).

Bed was pretty stiff, pillows were flat, and blanket was thin and small. Not to mention the bed bug bites I woke up to each morning. Thought it was just acne at first but I kept discovering more and they were extreme itchy, covering me head to toe. Bathroom was pretty nice, though you do have to share with 3 other bedrooms on your floor. Kitchen on the first floor is extremely modern and nice.

Very friendly and helpful. He was willing to help carry luggage up to apartment unit. He gave me clear answers to any questions I had.\nEverything inside the unit was well organized, neat and tidy. This unit is just perfect for one person or party of two. The bathroom is fairly spacious, much larger than an average unit in Hong Kong. The bed sheet was very clean and the bed was just fine. The pillows were too soft to my liking but that is just personal preference. Many of hangers in the closet available. Hong Kong is known for high humidity and hot weather but I had no trouble sleeping at night with AC on (there are two inside the unit; one in living room). \nLocation of this apartment is fantastic! Everything closely available within walking distance and lots of transit options within the area. Many restaurants open late night so there was nothing I needed to worry about.\nPrice wise per night is reasonable but could be better.

It's really a 2 minutes walk from Causeway Bay Exit C.\n\nThe key lock box is a bit tricky to open so make sure you follow the instructions carefully etc. I messed up by not following the instructions Jack sent and was quite frustrated at first but Jack was on it even though we checked in late (midnight). He was so concerned about our experience that he offered a discount - I never asked but was grateful.\n\nKeep in mind there is ZERO kitchen facilities except for a tea kettle and a small fridge. All of the bed linens and towels were clean and new looking. There's no utensils, bottle/wine opener- nothing but glasses/mugs.\n\nThe flat is very small. The bathroom is amazing. The mattress is semi-soft but there's an additional floor matt that we put on the bed that helped to make the mattress more suitable for my needs.\n\nThe place is newly renovated and has the look and feel of a modern space.\nThe flat is very quiet considering it's located on the 7th floor and right at a busy intersection. The building guards are helpful and did guide us to how to use the access codes to the main door.\n\nJack was attentive and always replied to messages within a time span that was helpful.\n\nI am not sure I will stay again, only because I prefer to be closer to SOHO. But I do recommend Jack's place - BUT it's very small BUT bigger than most HK hotel rooms within the same price point."},{"_id":"252969337","date":{"$date":"2018-04-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"20530526","reviewer_id":"75123418","reviewer_name":"Raymond","comments":"Nice arrangement and quick response from host"},{"_id":"254184828","date":{"$date":"2018-04-16T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"20530526","reviewer_id":"100571586","reviewer_name":"David","comments":"This place is very cosy and very near to the MTR and surrounded by many eateries and shops.
