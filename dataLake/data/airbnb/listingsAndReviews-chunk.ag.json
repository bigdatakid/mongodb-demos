A ","neighborhood_overview":"Our neighborhood, Poipu Beach, is one of the newest and priciest sub-divisions on Kauai. It is in a safe area and within a short walk to all kinds of things to do. Beaches, Shopping Boutiques, Restaurants, Snorkel and Surf-board rentals, Bike rentals, Pubs, and Grocery Stores,...are all a walk away. There are even more of everything a short drive away also. The best thing about where our place is in the neighborhood is...we are the closest property to the Ocean. A walk through the Grand Wyndham resort (which also has restaurants and pubs), finds you at the shoreline.   Perfect location.","notes":"Our subdivision is sensitive to the well being of the rare sea birds who nest in our jungles and must make their first hazardous flights to the ocean from the nest. We don't have street lights to allow the birds every chance to safely make it to the dark ocean at night (when these nacent flights occur). The young fledgling Shearwaters leave the nest and fly till they see moonlight or starlight reflected in the ocean. They then will land and rest for the night to begin their life as a denizen of the sea. So,...the open and dark skies at the house, not only assist the Shearwaters, but make for wonderful stargazing at the property. City dwellers can reacquaint themselves with the Milky Way, the North Star, Orion (in Winter) and Scorpio (in Summer) and other clearly visible constellations \u0026 stars.  After all the best experiences are free!!!","transit":"Really you don't need a car at our place. Everything you could want is a walk or quick bike ride away. However, if you want to explore the entire island we recommend a rental car. The island does have a great bus system and taxi cabs.","access":"The entire $2.5 million dollar home and garden are yours for the holiday!!! Fly a kite, run through the sprinklers, Stargaze (the Milky Way is easy to see here)...Pick a papaya or gather a bunch of bananas. Conduct a Wedding ceremony or Wedding Reception... Lay out on the lawn or the sun-deck...the place is your Kauai home!!! ALOHA.","interaction":"As longtime residents of Kauai...we know lots of great hikes, super snorkeling \u0026 surfing spots. We can direct you to any tour operators, including Na Pali Boat Tours, horseback riding, ATV tours and more.","house_rules":"","property_type":"House","room_type":"Entire home/apt","bed_type":"Real Bed","minimum_nights":"3","maximum_nights":"365","cancellation_policy":"strict_14_with_grace_period","last_scraped":{"$date":"2019-03-06T05:00:00.000Z"},"calendar_last_scraped":{"$date":"2019-03-06T05:00:00.000Z"},"first_review":{"$date":"2016-08-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"last_review":{"$date":"2019-02-25T05:00:00.000Z"},"accommodates":8,"bedrooms":3,"beds":4,"number_of_reviews":32,"bathrooms":{"$numberDecimal":"3.0"},"amenities":["TV","Cable TV","Wifi","Kitchen","Free parking on premises","Gym","Family/kid friendly","Washer","Dryer","Smoke detector","First aid kit","Fire extinguisher","Essentials","Shampoo","Hangers","Hair dryer","Iron","Laptop friendly workspace","Private entrance","Ethernet connection"],"price":{"$numberDecimal":"425.00"},"security_deposit":{"$numberDecimal":"480.00"},"cleaning_fee":{"$numberDecimal":"200.00"},"extra_people":{"$numberDecimal":"50.00"},"guests_included":{"$numberDecimal":"8"},"images":{"thumbnail_url":"","medium_url":"","picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/cbb82d84-28e8-43e9-b116-25977f869602.jpg?aki_policy=large","xl_picture_url":""},"host":{"host_id":"76874677","host_url":"https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/76874677","host_name":"Reba","host_location":"Hawaii, United States","host_about":"Kauai Resident for 30 Years.

Also there is no air conditioning, however there are two fans which were enough for me to feel comfortable in hot days. The design of the apartment is great too. In the house there are several similar apartments which are rented by the same hosts, and on the ground floor there is a shop where the host works daily, so  it is very easy to find her if needed. She was very hospitable and told me everything about the apartment and the neighbourhood to make my stay comfortable and interesting. There was even a printed booklet with lots of useful information on the diner table along with some snacks and port wine.

I booked this place specifically because he listed it as one bedroom and one pull out couch.   I wanted the second bed since I was meeting my dad in NY.  However, I think the most suspicious part of this whole transaction was the fact that the address he provided us was different from the one in his listing.  I contacted customer support and worked with Diane and Megan.  They were kind, courteous, and responded quickly using both phone and email to contact me.  After their investigation, they agreed that Antonio misrepresented his listing and I was refunded the whole amount.

Madison Square Park is a couple blocks and is so fun! We went to a broadway show and it was a convenient UBeR away. I only took the subway once to say I did but I am not sure if it's good for that. I used UBERs and UBeR eats almost Daily, very easy for the locale. The balcony is the gem of this spot, it's so nice to have. I highly recommend staying here!!!! It's so easy and Manos made everything simple.

I felt at ease at any time of the day. \nAnother advantage is that the apartment is within a short walking distance to subway stations, Madison park , Empire State, clothing stores, restaurants, pharmacies, and organic health food stores! \nAs for the host, Gianni has a truly kind character. Even though I had arrived a little late to the apartment on my first day, he was understanding and made me feel comfortable. Furthermore, he took the time to show me around the neighborhood.  He was also very responsive and willing to help at any time, literally! Once I was locked out of the apartment at 11 pm, I reached out to him and he came for help a few minutes later. \nIt was a wonderful stay, and I highly recommend this home. \n\n"},{"_id":"317757441","date":{"$date":"2018-09-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13488308","reviewer_id":"195808500","reviewer_name":"Mareike","comments":"Very nice place, very nice host.

Además, no habíamos aparcado en una zona  conflictiva, sino en un barrio residencial, muy cerca del apartamento. \nLo verdaderamente problemático no es el robo en sí, sino el hecho, ante la perspectiva de un largo viaje para volver a casa, de no tener ayuda posible: que el seguro no responda, no tener internet en el teléfono, etcétera, hecho que probablemente constituya un incentivo para los ladrones, pues es obvio que actúan desde el rencor.\nSi Margarida dispone el aparcamiento trasero a la casa todo será más seguro. No le recomiendo a nadie dejar el coche en la calle.\nEs recomendable también, controlar los precios de las tarifas de datos, ya que la Wi-Fi que nos fue brindada solo funcionó el primer día, y se hace muy necesaria estando de viaje. \nPor otro lado, es difícil llegar a entender para un español (que tenemos fama de fiesteros y gritones) como es posible que en una zona residencial todas las noches se reúna gente en una plaza a beber y hablar hasta las cuatro o cinco de la mañana. El caso es que como la visita ha sido en agosto y el calor era insoportable, teníamos que tener las ventanas abiertas y era muy difícil dormir, pues la gente no tenía ninguna consideración ni civismo en este aspecto.\nEsto no pretende ser una crítica destructiva; quizá tuvimos mala suerte, y aunque creo que hay aspectos a mejorar, el apartamento es una  buena oportunidad para conocer la ciudad, sobre todo por su relación calidad-precio y porque Margarida responde siempre con una sonrisa. Aun teniendo en cuenta los aspectos señalados, estoy seguro de que con el tiempo el recuerdo será bueno."},{"_id":"93321583","date":{"$date":"2016-08-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13501113","reviewer_id":"55254902","reviewer_name":"Mélanie","comments":"Un très bon accueil de la part de Margarida.

Also the wooden floor is nice, and the kitchen is small but modern and has all you need to prepare small meals.\nCommunication and check-in was very professional. The flat was super clean.

The flat is located next to Casa da Musica, Mercado Bom Sucesso (you definitely need to go there for food) and other nice places. In terms of transports, we had a nightbus coming from the airport right next to the flat, which was really convenient (daybus also to the airport works).

Da das Alles etwas spontaner passiert ist haben wir auf Air BnB nach einer Bleibe gesucht und sind schnell fündig geworden. Wir hatten Glück, das zu diesem Zeitpunkt die Wohnung frei war. Diese scheint ansonsten immer sehr gut ausgebucht zu sein. \n\nDie Wohnung ist genauso wie auf den Bildern. Sie ist hell, sauber und Alles notwendige ist vorhanden. Wir bekamen sogar auf Anfrage noch zwei Strandtücher. Es sind schon ein paar Lebensmittel vorhanden wie Kaffee, Reis, Honig etc.. \n\nDie Wohnung hat einen Balkon zum gemütlich draußen sitzen. \n\nDas Bett ist so wie in der Beschreibung - ca. 135 x 180. Es muss daher ein bisschen gekuschelt werden. Die Kissen sind auch etwas zu klein für meinen Geschmack. \n\nDie Wohnung ist mit wenig Gehminuten an eine Metro angebunden mit der man sehr gut in die Innenstadt kommt. Etwa 15-20 min. Von dort kann man Alles erkundigen und auch schnell mal nach Matosinhos zum Baden fahren.\n\nAlles in Allem eine sehr gut Alternativ zu einem Hotel. Es mangelt an nichts und die Wohnung ist sehr freundlich. Es sind auch einige Bücher und Magazine über Porto vorhanden um sich ein wenig einzulesen.\n\nDie Gastgeberin selbst ist sehr nett. Wir haben sie zwar nicht persönlich getroffen aber sie hat uns weiter geholfen falls wir fragen hatten. \nAm Tag der Ankunft hat ein Freund von ihr auf uns gewartet und uns denn Schlüssel gegeben. Unser Flieger hatte Verspätung und wir hatten Probleme mit dem METRO Ticket (Tipp: Ticket wenn möglich schon vor Reiseantritt kaufen Porto-Karte oder Andante Karte), aber das war Alles kein Problem.

She went out of her way to make me feel comfortable and (in effect) have a home away from home.  Her apartment is nothing short of amazing.  It is a great size for Hong Kong, incredibly comfortable, spotlessly clean and elegantly furnished.  The apartment is an an oasis from the hustle \u0026 bustle of Hong Kong.  It is perfectly situated on Hollywood Road, in the thick of a great selection of restaurants \u0026 bars and parks and is walking distance to Central \u0026 SOHO.  The apartment is open and airy, filled with natural light and is perfect for the business person that needs space to work out of or just to have a breather from the Hong Kong pace (a real luxury for Hong Kong).  The rooftop garden is a real bonus.  What a wonderful and unique experience.  I highly recommend this to any business person and discerning traveller.  I hope to return there soon.

We stayed for 10 days and felt at home as soon as we walked through the door. Really enjoyed the neighborhood - it was fairly quiet at night, but just a few blocks to walk to the shops and restaurants along Hollywood Road (the art/artisan shops at PMQ were our favorite). The kitchen is well equipped and there are two grocery markets within a few minutes walk (one Chinese-style and one English-style), so it was easy to make breakfast each morning, open up the balcony doors, and listen to the birds chirping in the park across the street. Barbara was very helpful with suggestions on dinner places - she gave us 6 suggestions within a 5 minute walk; we made it to 5 and had a great meal each time. The Sheung Wan area is very convenient to Central and it's easy to pick up taxis, trams, and the MTR within a few blocks of the apartment to get anywhere in the city.

This area provides a lot of atmosphere with many small Chinese stores and a couple temples nearby.   Cute cafe for morning coffee on ground level of building.  Hollywood Park across the street.  Antique stores just down the street and nightlife of LKF and SoHo are within walking distance but far enough away to not disturb your sleep.\n\nBarbara was very responsive and easy to communicate with.

Despite such a crazily short notice Barbara immediately arranged a key for me to get in without any complaints. The 24hr doorman is always so nice. I didn’t have a chance to wander around but as far as I know restaurants, convenient stores or even hospital are all downstairs and IFC (the usual working place) is just 5-10min taxi away. I’ve had some terrible experience staying at Airbnb HK previously and switched back to the boring 5 star hotel mode since then. But I would now defo place Barbara’s apt as my top choice whenever I travel to HK. I would sincerely recommend it to anyone who wants to have a down-to-earth experience in HK esp those on business trips. Last word, the pano view is amazingly refreshing - you’ll know what I’m talking about if you are familiar with the HK housing conditions ;p"},{"_id":"260469336","date":{"$date":"2018-05-04T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13505139","reviewer_id":"19843683","reviewer_name":"Wendy","comments":"Barbara's apartment is in the perfect postion on HK Island , close to an MTR, not far from the ferries ( an easy walking distance) lots of good cafes and restaurants in the area and grocery shops if you want to self cater.

We took the subway every day and  got very used to the walk. There aren't many things to do in the area, but with the subway so close, it didn't really matter to us.\n\nAt first glance, the neighborhood appeared a little sketchy and run-down, but we never had an issue.

It is probably from the neighbors smoking. I did let her know and hopefully this issue can be addressed in the future. We just left the bathroom vent on and it seem to help.

He was extremely helpful and friendly. He got in touch with us before we arrived to let us know the best transport options from the airport, to make sure we knew exactly where the flat was, and to tell us about some great free events that were happening while we were in Barcelona. He also sent us a message to let us know that he had beach towels we could use so we didn't need to bring any. When we arrived at 1 am, he was there to greet us and was very friendly. He showed us around the whole apartment, explained how everything worked and he had bought us some things for breakfast. The flat was very clean and spacious and had a lovely balcony. The bathroom and bedroom were both great and matched the description. He provided us with everything we needed and more - towels, beach towels, aftersun, breakfast and coffee, we could use the kitchen, we could borrow his two bikes to go to the beach. He even brought us fresh cherries from his parents' house. He was extremely polite, friendly and helpful throughout our stay. Our only regret is that we did not stay for longer! We highly recommend Froilan and his flat. The location is also great - quiet, safe area near the seafront and the CCIB conference centre and with excellent transport links to the nearby city centre (metro/bus/tram).

Die Lage ist gut, man erreicht die Innenstadt von Porto fußläufig innerhalb von 15min und es sind Einkaufsmöglichkeiten direkt um die Ecke.\nDer Check-in verlief leider nicht so, wie wir es uns gewünscht hätten: auf unsere Nachrichten vor Ankunft wurde nicht geantwortet und als an der angegebenen Adresse niemand öffnete, mussten wir zweimal anrufen, um zu erfahren, dass die falsche Hausnummer angegeben war. Das Zimmer wurde uns auch nicht von Zé gezeigt, sodass wir sie gar nicht kennenlernten in der Zeit. Das Zimmer an sich war nicht schlecht, eine kleine Küche sowie eigenes Bad waren vorhanden. Die Küche war allerdings gar nicht ausgestattet, wir hatten zwar Teller und Besteck, aber keine Töpfe usw. zum Kochen. Auf der angegebenen Handnummer gingen immer verschiedene Leute ran, welche nur Portugiesisch gesprochen haben, sodass wir auch keine Info bekamen, ob wir uns irgendwo Küchenutensilien leihen können. Auch haben wir Zé über Airbnb eine Nachricht geschrieben bezüglich der Ausstattung, bekamen jedoch erst 3 Tage später eine Antwort- das war an unserem letzten Tag. Leider auch sehr negativ ist, dass man wirklich jedes Geräusch der Nebenzimmer hört und die Dämmung des Zimmers auch nicht besonders gut ist, sodass es nachts sehr kalt wird und die Handtücher durch anstauende Feuchtigkeit nicht trockneten.\n\nDas Preis-Leistungsverhältnis insgesamt ist okay, jedoch war die fehlende Kommunikationsmöglichkeit ein absolutes no-go. Des Weiteren würden Kleinigkeiten (wie Kleiderhaken, zwei Stühle statt einem am Tisch...) den Aufenthalt deutlich angenehmer gestalten. Wir würden das Zimmer nur eingeschränkt weiterempfehlen."},{"_id":"203646288","date":{"$date":"2017-10-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13521222","reviewer_id":"101834830","reviewer_name":"Bruno","comments":"Desde o início Zé foi muito atencioso e imediato nas respostas, esclarecendo tudo para que a estadia fosse a melhor possível.

The area was so quaint with many great cafes in short walking distance and the supermarket just across the street. The bus and train provided us easy access around and the walk to the Opera House and Harbor Bridge through the Royal Botanical Gardens was beautiful, though a bit long. It was relaxing to sit at the bar top and look out at the tree-lined street below or further out to the CBD skyline.  We did find the apartment a bit tight when walking from the main living area to the entry hall where the mini fridge is with the bed lowered, so we probably should’ve raised it when not in use. When I slept I could sometimes feel the the bed frame through the mattress, so I think maybe a memory foam mattress might work a bit better, I’m not sure.  There is a step up/down getting in and out of the shower with somewhat reduced headroom which won’t affect most people but could if someone had limited mobility or was very tall.  The walls were thin but the neighbors were all quiet in the evenings.  Vickie was so sweet to provide coffee, tea, water, muesli, and milk, and she provided us great tips and recommendations on places to go and how to get there!

We were in Sydney for almost a month as our daughter had just had her first baby and the apartment was perfect for a number of reasons. It was in the perfect location being only a 5 min walk to her place as well as the best street in Potts Point! Just one block away were our favorite places to eat on Challis Street.... Fratell’s, The Fish Shop and Fejays.  Across the street is a great grocery store ... Woolworths.\nEvery Saturday is a wonderful open Market up the street with the best corn fritters I’ve ever had and more. The Kings Cross train station is only 5 min away as well, which made getting around super easy.\nHer apartment was very clean, bright and comfortable. For being a studio we were a little concerned it may feel cramped for a month stay, but it never felt that way and a lot of that had to do with the the wall of windows that had a great view overlooking the trees and the city.\nThe shower was a little tricky as it was small and you had to step up to get into it, so we bought a small shower mat and that did the trick so there was no more fear of slipping! \nVictoria has really thought everything thru as far as utilizing her space for the best efficiency and added great touches with all the amenities.\nWe will look forward to staying there again on our next visit to see our daughter and family!"},{"_id":"258864364","date":{"$date":"2018-04-30T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13530122","reviewer_id":"164933547","reviewer_name":"Maj Lyhne","comments":"Hun var så betænksom.

There is also a nice coffee spot down the street.  Unfortunately, in the listing, it says there is free street parking and we could not find any free street parking.  Upon arrival I called the host about the free street parking and she said there was not any.  We would have to park in the paid garage next to the premises, which would be $30-40 per night.  Or drive into another neighborhood (not close) to maybe find street parking.  We were staying 3 nights so that could be up to $90.  I would have figured out a different place or other parking arrangements if I knew ahead of time.  Later she messaged and said that the free street parking is limited by time.  I feel that is quite unfair to say free street parking if it is only for 1 hour or so.

I think its also important to note that when we stayed there Kateryna was not living in the flat herself but her mother was. There was also a distinctive smell of cigarette smoke throughout the flat however we managed to keep this out of our room by having the door shut at all times. Overall our stay in Barcelona was fantastic however I feel that for the price we paid the above issues were not really acceptable.

There were times when the apartment smelled like cigarettes but was likely because the patio doors were open, and neighbours smoke on their patio. We closed the doors when we left the apartment and did not have that issue again.

However, we were surprised that the description did not say that there are 50 steps in a poorly lighted staircase to the apartment. Kateryna’s mother Nadia, greeted us and lives in the apartment. They rent out another bedroom and had several guest during our 8 night stay. Our bedroom had a comfortable bed but was not air conditioned and quite hot even in September. It had a small hanger for clothes which was inadequate. There was a strong smell of cooking from other apartments. Nadia is also a smoker which was bothersome as we don’t smoke. It was very difficult to adjust the temperature of the water, especially in the shower.  Even taking a short 1 minute shower, the water went from boiling hot to freezing cold since the water heater is too small or malfunctioning. The listing included use of the kitchen, but Nadia appeared not too happy that we cooked some meals there. There is a washing machine in the kitchen and after the 3rd night, we asked Nadia if we could use it. She agreed to it. The other guest also used the washing machine. After the 6th night, we needed to wash another load. When the washing machine was in the spin cycle, Nadia came into the kitchen with very angry words and stopped it. There is no excuse for this behavior and it left us with a very bad impression."},{"_id":"324880188","date":{"$date":"2018-09-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13552883","reviewer_id":"27510220","reviewer_name":"Qi","comments":"Really close to the attractions, and the host was super cooperative and kind, the house was very clean and Barcelona is just greattttttt!"},{"_id":"337072756","date":{"$date":"2018-10-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13552883","reviewer_id":"87456590","reviewer_name":"Bram","comments":"I would not recommend this apartment.

We were hoping to shower after our long flight but there were no bath towels when we arrived. I texted Ali and the towels were delivered while we were out for lunch. There was only one tube of shampoo and conditioner provided that were clearly taken from hotels. There was a bar of soap for bathing and it had obviously been used before. The previous things I can deal with, but for our 5 night stay for 2 people, there was only one and a half rolls of toilet paper. I texted Ali for toilet paper, shampoo, and soap twice, but received no response.\r\n\r\nI loved the apartment, but it needs to be better stocked."},{"_id":"103489056","date":{"$date":"2016-09-22T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13562321","reviewer_id":"40184884","reviewer_name":"Ross","comments":"The host was very helpful, and all went smoothly."},{"_id":"108316370","date":{"$date":"2016-10-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13562321","reviewer_id":"42336177","reviewer_name":"Richard Kok-Fhung","comments":"We stayed here for a family of four.

All the main touristic spots are literally walking distance (Darling Harbour, Circular Quay, Sydney Town Hall, main shopping centres). When we needed to use the train, Wynyard Station was just a couple of blocks away. Savings time and money with this prime location was definitely a bonus.\nThe flat feels bigger than in the pictures. The building feels old but once you get inside the flat everything is well kept. The main bed and the sofa bed were comfy and with white crisp linens. Had plenty bath and face towels. Did not find a problem with the hot water pressure as previously stated (might have been fixed). There are washing and drying machines in perfect working condition. The bedroom has a ceiling fan that was enough to sleep, there were a couple of pretty hot nights outside but we only needed to turn on the aircon for a couple of hours and the entire flat would cool off. The kitchen has everything needed to prepare all meals.\nDealing with the host was also a pleasant experience. All the information requested was given in a straightforward manner without delay. \nOverall, a great experience!

There is a Woolworth Express right around the corner to stock up on whatever you would like for food, snacks, or sundries. Very convenient.\n\nThe apartment windows look into an alley where it is noisy early from garbage trucks, vehicles, and other maintenance. The hosts informed us about this.\n\nWe had issues checking in as the apartment was not cleaned, which got resolved. That said, we never received confirmation from the host or property manager, after specifically inquiring to both, if the bed linens were laundered after the previous guest left or the bed was just made with the same linens.\n\nA few comments about the apartment. The mattress is less than acceptable IMO.  It is lumpy and springy and we could get a good sleep the 4 nights we stayed. Hard to believe this has not been replaced. So, while the apartment is functional as described, it is in need of TLC and better property management attention. The bath and kitchen amenities seem mostly to be leftovers from other guests and there are just some things worn out such as the shower head that does not stay in place making it difficult to shower. \n\nCommunication with the host was very responsive during the  booking stage but once confirmed and money paid ... and when issues occurred, they were, well let’s just say, less than responsive.\n\nPersonally, despite the location and premium this apartment should command in the CBD, the value IMO is EXTREMELY low for what they charge when considering all the other factors outlined above and more that I communicated to the hosts directly. I have offered suggestions to the host directly and constructively for them to improve based on above and other details ... however, I have not received a response of course.\n\nThat said, you will love CBD ... a visit to Baxter’s Inn is a must (you will  understand when you finally find it and immerse yourself with the locals for a drink - there is no food). We had amazing dinners at Bistro Papillon (steps from the apartment) and at Bambini. A visit to QVB (Queen Victoria Building), Strand and area is a shopper’s haven and both are a must do. Special mention to the ladies at Cue (a ladies fashion shop ... fine Aussie designs). When (not if) you go to the Opera House, be sure to walk through the Botanical Gardens. Lots to explore and enjoy in Sydney.\n\nI sure wish our experience at “Clarence House Apartment” was not the last accommodation image we had on an otherwise impeccable 24 day experience of Australia.\n\nMichael"},{"_id":"356319471","date":{"$date":"2018-12-07T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13562321","reviewer_id":"16595951","reviewer_name":"Kajan","comments":"The apartment was in a great location and near restaurants, bars, grocery stores and transport.

From the spacious living areas to the modern decor, Leila's condo is located in a prime spot with spectacular views of the Pacific Ccean. After staying at her place, I wanted to highlight 4 great things about our experience: \n\n1) Resort amenities- there is a complimentary shuttle that can take you between the Ritz Carlton and Montage resorts from your villa, along with other places in the Kapalua resort. This is great, especially for trying the top rated restaurants at the resorts without having to pay for parking...plus you can have a glass (or bottle) of wine and let someone else worry about the driving :) Or you can walk!\n\n2) Accessibility- Whether you are looking to take in a nice stroll along the beach or play a round of golf, her villa is nestled right in the heart of the Kapalua Resort. Even in the rain, you can enjoy the nice pool with a covered eating area! And I need to mention that the views from her condo are breath-taking, so if you fancy a night in, hers is the place to do it!\n\n3) Her Condo- I've stayed at hotels and resorts before, but I have to say that her villa exceeds anything you can find at a high end resorts. The wi-fi was strong and fast - able to be used among multiple devices. And the entire space was so clean! We had the security of knowing that the crew didn't just do a once over and be done, but actually took the time to make sure that it was ready and prepped for us, as if no one had stayed there before us. I'm a stickler for very nice bedrooms and beds, and hers was not only comfortable, but also offered me a great night's rest after a day of beach, beach and more beach :)\n\n4) Leila \u0026 Dan - They have been a gracious host, allowing us to stay at their condo. They were quick to respond, always providing us with best in class service, and were able to provide some great recommendations on activities and events to do on the island. \n\nI want to thank you for taking the time to read my review. Our experience staying at Leila and Dan's condo was great, and we truly enjoyed the time we spent on Maui. I cannot thank them enjoy for allowing us this great and special opportunity, and for giving us a chance to experience this beautiful island in a way that like no other. For this we are very grateful! \n\nWe wish you all the best in booking your stays through AirBnb and hope you have the opportunity to stay at Leila and Dan's condo... we hope to as well very soon! \n\nMahalo!"},{"_id":"120944632","date":{"$date":"2016-12-12T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13564779","reviewer_id":"81450514","reviewer_name":"Claire","comments":"Great location, clean and comfortable place.

The house had an incredible view from both the living room and the bedroom, and while there was an air conditioner, it wasn't needed due to the lovely breeze. The house is walking distance from a small beach, and is a quick drive to the Honolua General Store which has coffee, pastries, sandwiches and hot food, toiletries, towels, sunblock... pretty much everything. \n\nThe house comes equipped with travel size shampoo, body wash, hair conditioner, and bar soap. It also has a small hair dryer.\n\nThere are beach umbrellas and chairs in the backyard ready to be taken to the beach.\n\nThe wind gusts can get a little loud at times, I think because of how the house is situated on the hill. The bed was a little bit lumpy, but mostly soft and comfortable. The house renovations are gorgeous and look brand new, and there's a huge second bathroom with a great bathtub not pictured in the photos! Very clean, bright, and lovely. As other reviewers said, the photos do *not* do this house justice.\n\nOverall, it was a wonderful place to stay.

We loved waking up slowly in the mornings to smell of fresh brewed coffee (the coffee maker works great!). There was a convenient beach cooler bag in one of the cabinets and cozy robes -- really nice touches!\nWe had one minor issue that is no fault of the host, and may just be the unlucky weather... It was quite windy in the area our first few nights, so windy that we did not get much sleep. I don't know if this is typical for mid-December, but one other reviewer did mention a similar issue. The wind was howling and whistling through the doors and windows. Finally by our third night, the wind calmed down and from then on everything was absolutely beautiful.\nIt is a convenient quiet location, walking accessible, easy parking, clean, and comfortable. The kitchen was bright and sunny, well stocked with dishes, cutlery and containers for making simple breakfasts and beach picnics.  We picked up wonderful fresh fruits at the nearby Nipili Farmers Market (on Saturdays).

As a bonus, it is a short walk to the pool, beach and walking trails. We were also pleasantly surprised by it relative proximity to the Ritz Carlton complex and the famed Plantation golf course (where the  PGA's year opener Tournament of Champions is held). The unit, which backs onto the Bay golf course, is well kept and spacious with an updated kitchen and second bathroom (the main bathroom upstairs, however, is not, which may be a bit of a letdown to some). The veranda off the living room is a delightful place to have breakfast to the cacophony of cardinals and finches (and a few more we failed to identify). The fairly high-end community where this unit is located is well maintained, secure, and almost enveloped with verdant vegetation."},{"_id":"255204406","date":{"$date":"2018-04-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13564779","reviewer_id":"88572672","reviewer_name":"Melinda","comments":"Leila’s place is quiet and serene.

This place looks exactly like the pictures. The unit backs on to the kapulua bay golf course. The view from the living room and bedroom is of the water. The location is well located within walking distance from the Ritz and Merrimens (best restaurant we went to during our stay). Further, Kaanapali and Lahaina are within driving distance. Best of all, Leila is incredibly responsive. We had to contact her relatively early in our stay about getting into the house and she responded within in minutes. Further, she accommodated us when we asked for a late checkout on our last day (as there were a few days the place was unoccupied following our stay). This really helped us out as we had booked an early half day excursion on our last day and needed a place to shower, change and pack afterwords.  Both my bf and I agreed that if we come bacl, we would stay here again. I would highly recommend staying here.

All the things you'd want in an exceptional apartment all found in the same place: - Beautiful apartment - the pictures cannot do it justice - it's a modern multi-floor apartment. Sliding doors make it so easy to get the breeze in both the bedroom and the living room and kitchen. Porch and patio make it easy to soak up the morning, afternoon, or evening. - Beautiful modern kitchen, including great appliances mean it's easy to go shopping for fruit or local food and enjoy it on your schedule. - Location is spectacular, not only because you've got views, but because the resort association takes care of the grounds around the apartment and in the complex. When you sit on the porch you can enjoy the view in a clean and well taken care of area. - Close proximity to the west-side of Maui, without being in the bustle. Everything from local beaches with great snorkeling, great local food spots, resorts \u0026 malls, and quick drives down to the other west-side beaches. When you return to the apartment, you get to escape and go back to a quiet and beautiful view. - The apartment is well thought out and stocked - there is everything you'd need for a long stay including a kitchen with all the appliances \u0026 pans \u0026 knife sets, fully stocked bathrooms with extra supplies, the linens you need, beach chairs if you need them, binoculars, lots of chairs and couches, great high speed internet \u0026 wifi, tvs with good service, multiple bathrooms and multiple sinks, really anytime we needed anything it was likely to already be in the apartment. If we did want to buy something, there are multiple stores a few minutes away. - Leila is a great host, using clear and well tested instructions for getting in and out of the apartment (keys, internet, directions, parking, etc.) and is also very responsive on the platform if you have any questions or changes. She's local which gave us comfort if things went wrong. - We happened to be on Maui when hurricane Lane (which became tropical storm Lane) hit us. Leila was a great host during that time, the apartment felt rock solid and we never had any concern for our safety, and the resort grounds around it were extremely well maintained and cleaned right after the storm. So it's rare, but if something does happen - this apartment that's built so well and is on higher ground, managed by professionals 24/7, is a great place to be. Leila also offered us a place to stay with her (not the AirBnB) if the hurricane hit and we had no where else to go. Thankfully, we were able to stay in the apartment (and Leila was able to extend our reservation) - but that's the true definition of a great host. Highly recommended - couldn't ask for a better apartment or host in Maui.

The home is situated on a small hill within the resort so the view of the ocean is magnificent. The interior has a fresh, modern look but still feels very cozy. The location in Kapalua puts you near some of the most amazing beaches in Maui, as well as amazing local restaurants, cafes and shops. My girlfriend and I loved being able to explore so many different areas but also be so close to the beach. We didn't make use of the pool and bbq area but it's accessible for guests. In addition to Leila's recommendations, make sure to check out the Maui Revealed book she has in the living room for great options for dining, beaches, and other hidden Maui gems. The bedroom offers a large comfy bed, TV, and balcony with the same amazing view of the ocean. Other amenities that we enjoyed were the 2 full baths (one of which is humongous), great AC units, dedicated parking spot, and stocked kitchen. Leila was always very responsive as a host and we knew if we ever needed anything, she would be there to help us.

Como ponto negativo principal foi o mau cheiro do banheiro do quarto, muito forte. Outro ponto é a questão do estacionamento, que entendi quando aluguei que era do imóvel, mas, no entanto, é em um estacionamento privativo próximo. Quando cheguei ao local, o responsável pela casa que me recebeu informou que voltaria no penúltimo dia para reembolsar o valor gasto com o estacionamento, mas não foi o que aconteceu.\r\nQuando liguei me passaram que deveria encaminhar por email os comprovantes de pagamento, e assim seria feito o reembolso. Não tenho como afirmar se funcionou ou não, pois até o momento ainda não obtivemos respostas sobre o assunto. Tirando esses pequenos\r\npercalços, tudo foi excelente.

Everything was thoughtfully provided. I had good wifi, a well equipped kitchen to make brekkie, and lots of hot water for a bath at the end of the day. Great location - easy to catch public transport (bus 311 or walk 7 mins to Kings Cross station), but the off street parking around the area was mainly 1 hour so it might be tricky if you have a car. Lots of restaurants nearby, Hayes theatre round the corner and small weekend market (Saturday is better). I felt safe walking around even at night as there were plenty of people eating at the restaurants nearby. The apartment is on first floor so you need to be able to carry your bags up a flight of stairs. It only had filtered light as it faced another building so you have to turn the lights on all day long and was noisy when I was staying due to the construction next door. It would not be a place to stay in, ie, if you were planning to be resting indoors during the day time hours. I recommend this place for someone active who is going to be out and about all day. as it quietens down by evening and that's when the apartment is at its best."},{"_id":"189788455","date":{"$date":"2017-09-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13595339","reviewer_id":"7142196","reviewer_name":"Sarah Ruth","comments":"Beautifully furnished apartment that indeed has a lot of personal charm in what is my favourite neighbourhood in Sydney -- Mariana was a lovely host and provided me with a warm welcome."},{"_id":"199441868","date":{"$date":"2017-10-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13595339","reviewer_id":"27525860","reviewer_name":"Mariana","comments":"Mariana's studio is a place where you feel like home.

We feel very lucky to have come across such a beautiful spot like this one and at such a decent price. My husband and I always stay in Potts Point/Elizabeth Bay when in Sydney but always spend more money than we'd like on accommodation. Mariana's spot will definitely be our go-to for future trips: it has everything you need and was incredibly clean. The bed was so comfortable and my husband couldn't stop commenting on how great the shower was! \"That was one of the best showers I've ever had. I think it's the shower heads. We need to look into shower heads like these...\" \n\nFor those who have never been to Sydney, the accommodation is close by Kings Cross station which will take you anywhere you need to go in the city, but there are TONS of great coffee shops and wine bars right outside your front door. Elizabeth Bay is beautiful, a short walk away, which is worth a visit. Perfect place to sit with your morning coffee. My husband and I had a great time.\n\nChecking in was seamless. Mariana was the perfect host and very kind. She let us know about something we left behind which was sentimental and made plans to get it back to us. This thoughtful gesture proves what a caring host she is!

I was so happy with the location - Woolworths just across the road, 30 mins walk to circular quay, lots of lovely restaurants and cafes and I didn’t feel worried walking around at night alone so can’t ask for better! \nThe flat was lovely. Really clean and tidy with a heater and fans so easy to keep warm or cool depending on the weather. Fantastic rain shower as well! \nI stayed here for a little over a month and the only thing I missed was having an oven. There’s a microwave and hobs so easy to manage without. \nMariana had fly screens in place to keep the room ventilated which was lovely but it was very noisy the first night where we could hear the next door neighbours conversations and music! No problem to take some of them down and no problems with noise once we could close the windows. \nThe internet did drop in and out a little in the evenings but always sorted itself out so again not really a problem. \nAll in all it is a really lovely flat where I felt safe and comfortable in a new city on the other side of the world!

Best location for anyone who wants the easiest access to all types of transportation for work or for leisure. As for parents like us travelling with an elderly and two active young children, Wilson's apartment is the best to meet our needs. Not only it is so clean and safe for kids, its convenient location allows us to return for nap and rest when kids are tired between our busy holiday schedules. Wilson is so approachable and very thoughtful in many details.\r\nClean linens, towels, kitchenware, clothes washing powder, indoor storable clothes liner, refills of every consumable daily essential items eg toilet papers, tissues etc.\r\nThere are some stairs upon entry into lobby/lift of the building but it is a very common feature in Hong Kong. You can open the French-door-type glass doors fully before you enter with big luggages. The building guards/administrators on duty are very friendly too.\r\nSurprisingly, it's so quiet and comfortable to sleep, considering its prime location in one of the busiest parts of Hong Kong. Eating, shopping, sightseeing...all within walking distance or so easy for additional transportation when preferred.\r\nThank you for making our stay in Hong Kong so memorable.\r\nStrongly recommended!"},{"_id":"105445969","date":{"$date":"2016-10-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13603801","reviewer_id":"22627156","reviewer_name":"Emily","comments":"We didn't meet Wilson but he made things easy the day before checking in Wilson had sent me a email with all the info I needed to get into his place which was awesome. The location was great it was close to the MTR/public transportation, restaurants, market, etc... The only con to the location is that it was a little hard to get a taxi because coming out of the building cars are not allowed to stop in that area so you would have to walk a bit when taking/coming from a taxi. This has nothing to do with wilson but I thought I would mention it anyways the elevator in this building is extremely slow. The apartment was decent, it didn't wow me or anything but as expected places in HK are small. For a group of 9 it was a bit tight but that didn't bother us since we were out most of the time. The apartment looks pretty much like the pictures there is one thing I would like to say is I wish Wilson would have taken pictures of the second bathroom to his place kus it was tiny. I'm a really tiny girl and even I had a hard time in there. So that probably would have changed my mind on picking his place to stay because we were really looking for a 2 bathroom place. I mean yes the small restroom is considered as 1 but it was so tiny that we didnt even use the shower in it kus it  was tiny but oh wells. Overall our stay was fine but I did feel like the floors could have been a bit more clean.

There is all manner of good and quick eats in the immediate neighbourhood, banks, high end shops/restaurants, as well as convenience stores for water, snacks and access to MTR topup. A supermarket is two blocks away. Despite the central location, the room is high up and so was nicely quiet (surprisingly).  Elevator worked well, and the entry flight of steps (about a dozen stairs) was fine for one of us who is of limited mobility (walks with cane). The kitchenette is small and basic, but has essentials: fridge, kettle and electric burner, and washing machine. Nota bene: the flat has A/C but can still get heat up, esp in afternoon. The entry watchman was very helpful, and gave nice advice a number of times. Top marks for Wilson, the host, who helped out a number of times -- really attentive and accommodating.

It was no problem for us cos our friend just slept on the upper bunk in of the bedrooms. We're relatively big (sized) people, and even though the bathrooms are kinda small, especially the ensuite, we managed to shower comfortably. Just let the water heat up for about 20 minutes. The location is hard to beat. Causeway Bay Plaza is next door, and Causeway Bay Station is a skip away. A good selection of western, local and international food is nearby. Do hop into Yee Shun Dairy and try the Ginger Steamed Milk. So so so good!!

The room was noisy overnight because it's right by the street but that didn't bother us much. The cat was friendly but keep the door closed if you don't want it to mess with your stuff. Communication with Svitlana was extremely easy and she is a very nice person. If we had any problems she was happy to help out and opened up her entire apartment to us. Check-in and check-out was very easy too. Perfect location from La Sagrada Familia and many good restaurants but a little far from the center.

Both Ben and his wife were super lovely and accommodated us with an early checkin at the last minute and had great communication. Ben and his wife even greeted us with fresh bagels and schmear from the famous fairmont bagel shop and croissants.  Their communication was great and the place was a great deal for the area. It is super close to a lot of bars, restaurants, and shops and walkable to the metro which was about 10min and close to many buses. Even though it was a hip and somewhat loud area on the weekend being off one of the side streets was very nice and quiet for a good night of rest. One thing to note is that you will need to use the set of keys to lock the door so going in and out requires the keys. It took some coordination but in the end it worked out. His entertainment set up is also amazing for when you want to curl up and watch on of their diverse library of DVDs  with surround sound. All in all I would stay again and Ben was a good host for our first time in Montreal.

Lots of ships coming and going to view.\nJoao makes every effort to make hosts comfortable and is very available for enquiries. We felt we were treated royally. \nThe apartment is well equipped for self catering and a well stocked larder.  Joao made some very good local restaurant (many in close proximity ) recommendations too. Major Supermarket other end of beach so handy to have bikes as transport. \nEverything made available from washing machine to bedding. Massive walk in wardrobe. Hot water reliable. \nHis knowledge of Porto and provision of maps and information including travel cards was very helpful. There is a bus stop very close which takes you into the city in about 40 minutes for only €1.85. Matosinhos is a 20 minute walk away where you can pick up Metro, visit a market or eat at the many fish restaurants (fresh from fish market adjacent).\nWe made good use of the bikes and this saved us time and expense also.\nWe took the brilliant cycle way (no hills!) along the coast for about 20 km (Vila do Conde and beyond). Beaches and cafes all the way so a great escape for the day.\nUnfortunate the lift not always working but we survived and our fitness improved. \nProbably true of all apartments of any height, you do get some road noise and barking/ howling from local dogs.\nHappy to return to what became home away from home for nearly 2 weeks.\nThankyou Joao for making it possible. \n"},{"_id":"106287976","date":{"$date":"2016-10-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13633280","reviewer_id":"46639892","reviewer_name":"Nicole","comments":"Joao is a great host!

If you don't mind walking about 20 minutes, you can take the metro or the 500 bus (which is scenic). If you'd rather catch the bus outside his apt, then it's 507. João will give you all the info you need!

For couples I recommend putting the taller person on the pulled-out section of the bed where at least there's no frame hindering the feet! ;)","transit":"Getting around is ridiculously easy from my place. Walk 5 minutes down the road for North Sydney Ferry wharf, 7 minutes to Milsons Point Train station, 10 minutes to North Sydney train station and bus stands.    From Milsons Point station, it's only one stop to the city. Should you want to explore a little more of the Northern side of Sydney, the bus stop right outside the apartment complex will take you to the suburbs of Neutral Bay and Cremorne, home of Australia's most beautiful independent cinema The Hayden Orpheum Picture palace; built in 1932 and restored to its amazing former Art Deco glory... for all you movie buffs out there, it's definitely worth a visit!","access":"Guests have access to the entire apartment - Make yourself at home! ^_^","interaction":"Although you might not see me in person, I'll be available for any questions or issues via mobile or Airbnb message!","house_rules":"Please use coasters for glasses, and use a tray or tea-towel if you're resting plates on any furniture that's not a table. If there's any spills, breakages or other accidents, please let me know as soon as possible - accidents do happen, but the sooner I'm notified the more likely we can come up with a fix ^_^ The only people who should be residing in my apartment are those listed as my guests on Airbnb - if you intend on having visitors please do me the courtesy of clearing it with me first.

It is in North Sydney which puts it into a lower price bracket, but it is a 5-10 minute walk to the North Sydney ferry which takes you right to Circular Quay, which is the public transportation hub and next to the opera house. You can even buy your public transport pass at the little store next to Millie's. Also, the apartment has a balcony with a stunning view of the Sydney Harbour bridge and skyline. These things compensate for the apartment's tiny size and lack of air conditioning. Millie left us with a lot of breakfast food plus coffee and milk. The kitchen was clean and well equipped. The bed converts from a day bed to a double, and even if we had done it correctly it would have required strength and lifting. If you are not young and strong get her to leave the bed set up for you. The apartment is charming and clean but the public areas of the building, including the laundry room, could use freshening, but don't let that put you off.

Both Kirribili/Milsons Point and North Sydney are  10 minute walks away. Her studio apartment is in a fabulous mid-century modern complex and she has arranged and furnished very much in period style with a few quirky popular culture and present day tweaks. It is a light-filled and generous space especially for the solo traveller. Whilst it is in a very busy district, there was not too much traffic disturbance and I could sleep well and comfortably.  Millie was also a thoughtful and generous host, who has excellent clear communication, has worked out simple and efficient processes for check-in and has second guessed the needs of travellers, and catered to them. One felt like a welcomed guest not a paying customer.

You walk up the road a bit to North downtown and that's where you can buy all the groceries, beer and wine you need for your stay at a pretty good deal.  The views out the balcony are awesome - yes Millie's place is on the corner of a pretty busy stretch of street during commuter hours - but it adds to the charm; watching everyone scurry off to work while you're on holiday!  And the evening time was great for the balcony as you can open up the door, grab a glass of wine and enjoy the views of the Harbour Bridge at evening and sunset.  The bed was very comfortable for one, the kitchen was well stocked, the building itself seemed very safe and secure and it had a nice little counter w/ two bar stools that you can set up your IPad for the day/morning, have breakfast and get some work done before heading out onto your adventures.  You can tell I'm a big fan - as I'm an airbnb Superhost myself back in the USA.  The best part ... Millie's customer service and communication.  I cam a long way from SFO airport landing at 6:30 am after a long flight and Millie went out of her way to make sure I could either do an early check in or bag drop - and she was awesome during my visit with places to check out, etc.  She's a Superhost for a reason.  I've traveled around the world and have been to many countries and continents staying at various Airbnb units - Millie's was right up there for location, value, services, views and cleanliness.

The views from the balcony are superb, a perfect place to spend an evening with a glass of wine. The apartment has a well equipped kitchen, there's good wifi and the bed is really comfy.\n\nI loved the location, just a few minutes walk from the station and the ferry (which was a great way to arrive in the city centre!), and you can easily walk or run to the north side of the harbour bridge and Luna Park. There's a few nice places to have coffee nearby (check out The Flying Bear) as well as amenities and a supermarket in North Sydney.  Crossing the harbour bridge or taking the ferry every day really added to my experience of Sydney.\n\nThere was a little bit of traffic noise which was the only slight downside (the place would really benefit from double glazing) but I soon got used to it and everything else more than made up for it. \n\nI'd love to stay again one day - a real 5 star Airbnb experience.

A true green oasis in Brooklyn. The location is second to none.

Where it matters (linen, bathroom, kitchen) - things were spotless. Rest of apt is pretty dusty but that doesn’t impact on the stay. \nThe Happy Host setup is a little impersonal and can make for tricky communication where there are questions or concerns.  \nA side note: the beds are very comfy, but if you have back issues it might help to know the mattresses lie on the floor. They’re terribly soft, which could be an issue if you have a bad back."},{"_id":"205210814","date":{"$date":"2017-10-21T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13684608","reviewer_id":"4763367","reviewer_name":"Elisabeth","comments":"The place was all together nice, but a few things were lacking and the communication with the host was a problem as he was late, not responding and only acting on essential requests when I contacted airbnb about the problems.

Near the action but not right in it. Easy to get to the train and other parts of the city. \n\nAlthough the location was great the place was very dirty and communication regarding details about checking in, checking out, wifi, and directions were difficult. \n\nThe place looks great in the pictures, but the pictures do not show the dust, mold and expired old food in the fridge. We came across a used q tip, dead bugs, used toothpaste, and a dirty ash tray too. \n\nThe moldy shower curtain was the worst part because it made the entire bedroom smell the whole time we were there. Being pregnant this was a concern. \n\nChecking in involved talking to 3 different people, and we were not provided information including the address, lock box code, wifi or details about the area until I asked a few days before. \n\nLastly, as we were packing up the cleaning person came in and started cleaning 20 minutes before we were due to check out. \n\nWe provided this feedback to the host and their concierge in the hopes these issues will be resolved because there is a ton of potential that is not being met. Hopefully they get it cleaned up and looking and smelling like the great place  it could be."},{"_id":"211608741","date":{"$date":"2017-11-13T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13684608","reviewer_id":"3719822","reviewer_name":"Mitch","comments":"Todd’s place is in a great location in the middle of Williamsburg.

This was the first time I felt compelled to write such a review after an Airbnb stay, but I feel like it will be important for potential future guests. First off, there are a few things written in the Airbnb description that I didn't find entirely accurate. The listing states that you will be greeted by a representative from Happy Host, a luxury Airbnb concierge service. The description states that this Happy Host rep would be greeting you upon arrival, providing a tour of the apartment, provide tips and local recommendations, and ensuring that you're provided with fresh linens, a clean apartment and fully-stocked essentials.. This never happened. When I booked the Airbnb, I was asked to provide my flight itinerary. I complied and figured this would be to plan the concierge check-in service weeks in advance. What actually happened on my check-in date was I received a text message with self-check-in instructions. That's it— no big deal, I guess. It's just not what was advertised. Second, the word \"luxury\" is used throughout the listing description. The Airbnb photos are very professional, the appliances and bathroom fixtures are very nice (aside from the downstairs bathroom cabinet that was falling apart). However, I would not describe this loft as \"luxury\" by any means. The couches especially are by no means \"luxury.\" Then lastly, the description describes the kitchen as \"fully equipped.\" This is definitely not the case. There are two very small saucepans and a 2-3 egg size skillet to cook. Aside from that, I suppose perhaps you could describe the kitchen as \"fully equipped.\" When I arrived, there was an extra-large laundry bag sitting in front of the door that was there the entire 4 nights of my stay. The beds lay directly on the floor. Instead of fitted bedsheets, standard bedsheets on top of bare mattresses is what we were left to sleep on top of. We were left one \"Amazon Basics\" brand towel per guest (not exactly luxury). Also, the 120\" theatre projector described in the listing was not hooked up to anything to stream content nor play audio with. I managed to find which wires needed to be plugged into what to get it to work, however I don't think that most people would have been able to or would want to figure that out. The front door would not close properly and lock the first night I got there because the plate that the deadbolt locks into was falling off. I found something to use as a screw driver to screw it back in. My biggest issue with the loft was the cleanliness. This place needs a thorough deep cleaning and dusting. There were also about five or so dinner plates in the kitchen cabinets that I went through and found dried bits of food and..."},{"_id":"221728858","date":{"$date":"2017-12-27T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13684608","reviewer_id":"16449852","reviewer_name":"Michael","comments":"This apartment is in an amazing location, and it worked perfectly as a share between two couples.

But, once you reach to her unit, you'll be rewarded with a great retreat.  The house is very clean and the room was spacious.  There's a big window besides the bed that brings in lots of natural light and there's even a TV in the room! Angela wasn't home the evening we stayed so we weren't able to converse more.

This is NOT hipster paradise, and it's NOT gangster's paradise either!  Our neighborhood is very residential and typically quieter than most urban cities. The summertime is louder on the block because very few people have air conditioning and enjoy hanging outside. The neighbors are friendly, so say hello as you pass! The ages of the neighborhood are very diverse (young children to elderly homeowners who have been here for 40 years). Flatbush has a lot of local charm and people with hearts of gold.  Jamaican food is plentiful (jerk chicken- yeah!); there is also a local donut shop nearby, Subway, Thai, sushi, pizza, and Indian food for delivery or a 5-15 minute walk to the restaurant, as well as many chain stores like Dominos, Dunkin' Donuts, IHOP, and Walgreens drug store. There is also a Planet Fitness (handy for Black-Card members!)

CHECK IN: This means, if you are coming in on a red-eye flight and are arriving early in the morning, the previous guest may still be occupying the room until after we have both left for work meetings. As we work and are not a full-time business (just a couple renting out a room to meet awesome travelers), we may not be able to change the sheets and thoroughly clean the room until later in the evening, sometimes as late as 7pm. You are welcome to drop your bags at any time on Check in Day! This is usually no issue 90% of the time. CHECK OUT: Additionally, because of time constraints, we may ask  that you be packed up and OUT of the apartment on the morning of your checkout. You are always welcome to leave your bags, especially for those guests who have late evening flights (Who wants, or COULD, drag all that gear around?!). Thank you so much in","transit":"We are located three blocks from the 2,5 trains at Church Avenue.

Since I was new to the area and stood out, I felt like I had to walk very quickly down the street from the subway to their house at night. I hope that helps!

I could find everything I needed for my entire month stay. The neighbourhood is completely safe - checked it at every time of the day:) A subway train will give you a pleasant ride to any attraction you need in Manhattan and not only there.\r\nDuring my long stay there were a lot of guests who where coming for shorter periods of time and staying in the other guest-room, and everyone was really satisfied by everything.\r\nIf you consider coming to New York for any purpose - vacation, studying or business - this is definitely the best place to stay!

The room and bathroom are cozy but were perfect for my stay. I definitely wouldn't stay there if you are traveling with a partner, but for one person its just fine. They were super close to the subway which made it very easy to get to Manhattan. I did have trouble getting an uber to their place the one time I tried, so if you prefer cabs this place might be tricky. I found the subway train very easy and as quick as a cab though. They also let me leave my bags there on my last day after my stay had completed so that I could go exploring around the city and not have to carry them until I was headed to the airport which was a huge weight off my shoulders- literally! I will say, the surrounding neighborhood wasn't as fun and interesting as I was hoping as far as any cool shops or eateries or the general atmosphere. Overall I enjoyed my stay. Very pleasant.

Very open \u0026 easy going.  Christa provides a lot of good information on the city.  Their space is cute!  A 2nd floor walk up is nice in a town like NYC.  The room is small but that's typical of the city.  The a/c unit was helpful.  Just one note to travelers:  there's only one bathroom that is being shared by you (and potentially someone with you), the host couple and possibly even 1-2 other guests for the other Airbnb room.  On my trip there were 5 of us sharing so in the morning especially there was a bit of a log jam but we were all courteous of each other's time which is important when you're wanting to explore a city like NY and factor in transportation time too.\r\n\r\nThe neighborhood is safe, lots of families, churches and shops.  It's a neighborhood with lots of islanders so awesome Trinidad, Jamacian, and Dominican/Haitian food in the immediate surroundings.  Also some great fruit markets I had fun exploring.  As a solo female traveler I felt safe.  \r\n\r\nThe 2 and 5 subway lines are just a few quick blocks away.  The closest neighborhood that is gentrified is called Franklin Ave, just 3-4 stops down in Crown Heights.  I also enjoyed hanging out at the restrants \u0026 shops there.\r\n\r\nOverall I feel like Christa and Zach's space is a great value! I want to attend something at Kings Theater next time!  That's an awesome historical theater that's close to this spot.

Also, the folder with the things to do and see in Brooklyn and Manhattan was particularly well-written along with being extremely helpful. In addition, I'm also highly recommending them to anyone who doesn't mind traveling a bit into Brooklyn.  Amazing shops and health food store near their place, on Rogers, just north of Church.  Subway access is so easy, to the 5 and 2 train, except the 2 train doesn't run on weekends --and weekends start on Friday evening...this is a little bit important to know.

I didn't use the kitchen, only for coffee once, but i you want, there's coffee, tea, cereal and milk to use and you can put your own food in the fridge and use their kitchen and spices to cook if you like. \nThe place has a good shower, nothing fancy but perfectly fine. Also, the doggies are very sweet and quiet, I did't even know they were there. \nI didn't meet Christa and Zach when I arrived and during my stay.

This is definitely not SOHO or TRIBECA so If you are not used to a real NYC neighborhood, it might seem kind of sketchy, scary, and overwhelming.

The room I had is tiny but they are totally upfront about that in the description and I didn't mind at all. Who wants to stay in when in NYC for a limited time anyway, right?! But yeah, for more than one person it might be less ideal.\n\nA few things to keep in mind. I shared the house with C\u0026Z and temporarily with other guests, too. While they try to manage and coordinate nicely, that still can mean 5 people for one bathroom in the morning. I guess when on vacation that is no problem at all though. NYC is vast and the 2/5 metro isn't that far from the house. However, make sure that suit your needs or u might end end up spending lots of time on the public transport.\n\nIn general I can recommend staying with C\u0026Z."},{"_id":"196003429","date":{"$date":"2017-09-21T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1370405","reviewer_id":"30729141","reviewer_name":"Marina","comments":"Easy stay at Christa's and Zach's!

She was a friendly and helpful host throughout my stay, and gave me plenty of useful advice about public transport.\r\n\r\nThe room itself is clean and comfortable, with a large bed and good-quality mattress. It's in a basement, so even without air conditioning it doesn't get too hot in summer.  There's also a large electric fan if you do need to cool off. The only downside was a strange chemical smell in the room - I never figured out where it came from.\r\n\r\nDespite being close to JFK airport, you can't hear any aircraft noise from the room, and I got a good night's sleep on all three nights I stayed. There are other guest rooms in the basement, however, so please be considerate and try to keep quiet late at night.\r\n\r\nThe house is in a pleasant neighbourhood, with just a short walk to local shops and a convenient bus service to Jamaica Center Metro station (for E, J, and Z trains).\r\n\r\nOverall, the room was good value and I enjoyed my stay."},{"_id":"93030740","date":{"$date":"2016-08-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13726629","reviewer_id":"85384188","reviewer_name":"Paul","comments":"Great location for JFK and Paulette was incredibly helpful with any questions i had for her.

I chose this AirB\u0026B because of proximity to friends; and I was planning on late nights and early mornings, anyway. However, the strong; and I mean strong, mothball smell; and the stale, questionable sheets are the primary reasons for my reduced ratings.\n\nTo put it gently, I despise the scent of mothballs, with a passion! If you use them, more power to you; but at least put it in the description. The smell was so pungent, in my room, that there were urine undertones to it; (or at least I hope those were the mothballs) and half a bottle of Febreeze couldn't mask it. \n\nBeing there five days, I begrudgingly accepted it; and once I left for the day I just put it in the back of my mind. However, today when arrived at the airport I realized the scope of the smell. Despite all my Febreezing, mothball funk had gotten into everything; my Bose Quiet Comforts, Sperrys, backpack, suitcase, everything! I can only imagine how I smelled to my friends; smh. \n\nAs far as the bedding, not only was it mothbally; but it was also hard; as if it hadn't been washed in months. Because my arrival/leaving time was an average of 2am to 6am; I just repeated my nightly mantra \"It was only 280 for six nights; it was only 280 for six nights\".\n\nOther problems were tiny room with no circulation; only a box fan for air; and a shower Simone Biles would have trouble fitting into. \n\nObviously this review may seem as an exercise in dissuasion; but actually, it's not. It's more of a \"If you're ballin on a budget in NYC; only need a place to s3 ... sleep, shower, and s***\" review this is a good place; just be at peace with smelling like your grandma's house and living like a Spartan. \n\n"},{"_id":"102602568","date":{"$date":"2016-09-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13726629","reviewer_id":"45313988","reviewer_name":"Dmitry","comments":"I've spent one night in this room, it was clean and nice.

This was January in NY and that does not do it.  I slept with my sweatshirt on and the towel that was provided on top of me to try and get some extra warmth, but really did not sleep.  It is hard to tell from the picture because the sheets (which are much nicer in the picture) look like a comforter.  They are not.  What you get is the thin blanket that is folded up on the bed in the picture.  It seems others are happy with this rental.  Again, it would have been \"ok\" for me except for this.

A large supermarket is just a few blocks away near Myrtle Ave.\n\nParking could be an issue but the L train is only a few blocks away. \n\nWe hope we could come back here on our anniversaries.  :-)"},{"_id":"175363608","date":{"$date":"2017-07-28T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13728712","reviewer_id":"139185194","reviewer_name":"Marian","comments":"This was our first trip to NYC and Maggie's place added to the adventure of it all.

It's located a short walk to the L and M lines, making it easy to get to other parts of Brooklyn and into Manhattan. Maggie is a very kind and generous host who responded very quickly to any questions we had (and if you're lucky, you might get to meet her adorable dog too!). Co-host Amy downstairs was also very helpful and made check in easily accessible for us. 10/10 recommend and hope I have a chance to stay in Maggie's place again in the future."}]}

My only suggestion:  we stayed during a couple of the hottest days of the year and the ceiling fans and two portable air conditioners weren't enough to cut the heat."},{"_id":"95131574","date":{"$date":"2016-08-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13743786","reviewer_id":"57364514","reviewer_name":"Loïc","comments":"The flat is at the top of a big house with 3 bedrooms and a living room which can easily be used as an extra bedroom.\nThe best is the huge terrace covered with a wonderful view on manhattan.\nThere are transportations all the night in area leading to southern manhattan in one hour door to door."},{"_id":"96601221","date":{"$date":"2016-08-23T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13743786","reviewer_id":"87766233","reviewer_name":"Anita","comments":"We had a great time here.

Getting in touch with Sergey about checking in was very easy and in general, he always responded back really quickly. We were on the top floor so we had access to the roof top area, which gave us a great view of Staten Island as well as Manhattan. Parking was easy and in terms of location, it was only a short distance to the ferry. The only thing to note is that it could be a little hot in the apartment -- I think the fans and AC units (located in each of the individual rooms) helped but it was still quite hot during the day. It wasn't that big of an issue later in the night so if you're spending most of your day out, it might not be a big deal.

Everyone loved it. We would definitely stay here again as the value was great. \r\n\r\nThe view was great. Check in was easy and only spoke with the host once. As mentioned in other reviews, the place does tend to get hot. For us, it wasn't too bad since the weather was cooler. Parking wasn't too bad, but don't be surprised if you need to park at the end of the street. The neighborhood seemed safe, so it wasn't an issue. Sergey did say we could park in the driveway, but I did not want to block other occupants of the house (This listing is for the top unit). \r\n\r\nThe apartment did have 4 beds although only one of the rooms wouldn't be considered private. You had to access one of the bedrooms through a den type room (listed as a bedroom). Not a problem for us, but keep it in mind if you are expecting 4 private bedrooms. The living room is also listed as a bedroom, however it does have a door to make it private. To get to the balcony, you will need to go through the living room. \r\n\r\nThe amenities were good. The free wifi was great and I was able to get 100Mbps down and 100Mbps up on a speed test. Unfortunately, the wifi signal did not reach to the kitchen (this could be a device issue). 4 towels were provided (we had 4 guests) along with 2 rolls of toilet paper. The dishes were minimal, but were adequate. We had 3 bowls and about the same amount of plates. Silverware wasn't an issue. There are no hangers listed in the amenities, but plastic store type hangers are provided and were appreciated. We did not use the tv as we mainly used the place as a sleeping place and then took the ferry to the city. \r\n\r\nWe drove our car to the garage located on Central Avenue (next to the Staten Island Criminal Court) and walked to the ferry terminal . Cost was $8/day but it does close at midnight. Ferry did take about a 30 minute ride to the city, but was a fun way to get there.\r\n\r\nThe neighborhood isn't that fancy or new, but we did feel comfortable and safe. Look beyond the buildings and you will see that this is a middle income neighborhood. Expect real New York and not the 1% neighborhoods. (I only mention this because 1 other review mentioned the neighborhood not being the greatest).

Communication with the host was always fast and clear. We were even provided with a welcoming gift! \nThere are, however, two downsides: the apartment is not equipped with an airconditioner or fan (which is not disastrous, but it can get pretty hot if you're not used to Portugese summers), and sounds from upstairs neighbours and the busy road it lies on can be heard at night. If you're a light sleeper, I suggest taking soundproof earplugs with you. \nOtherwise, it's a beautiful apartment if you want to enjoy both the city center of Porto and the beach!"},{"_id":"91395531","date":{"$date":"2016-08-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13757836","reviewer_id":"86361125","reviewer_name":"Bart","comments":"Beautiful appartement on a great spot very close to the beach.

The neighbourhood was great. All amenities were within a 5 minute walk, including food store, banks, subway and liquor store.  We ate out locally a couple of times at The Edge - recommend it.  Lovely bistros with several food influences and the Grange.  Food here was also excellent and we were treated to live jazz on the Sunday.\n\nWe'd highly recommend a stroll through St Nicholas Park.  Despite being in Harlem, we could get the express train to downtown Manhattan in 15 minutes.  Local people were very friendly, saying hello, as we walked up the street.  \n\nThere was a previous comment from another renter about the fridge size.  It's actually a standard UK under the counter fridge with an ice box.  Perfect to meet  our needs as we are in most evenings.\n\nWe would highly recommend this accommodation.  It took us just over an hour to get there from the apartment and it only cost us $7.75 each.\n\nIt was also great for us that there was a flexible check out time as our flight wasn't until 10pm.  If we were in a hotel, we would have been wandering around New York with suit cases.  Instead we were able to go for a walk through the parks and take our time getting the airport without any stress.\n\nWe didn't get to meet Jonathan but communication was excellent.

Also, the free parking was fantastic for a small/regular sized vehicle. Parking may be too tight for a large SUV. The keyless entry was convenient, and the ac was welcome as it happened to be a hot and muggy couple of days.

We liked that the apartment had Netflix already set up, and the kitchen was well-stocked with utensils if you want to save some money and cook for yourself. Bring your own food staples though, (salt, sugar, butter, etc) as there was no food in the apartment. Parking spot was easy to find, and we enjoyed the general feel of the place (brick walls, a good amount of light, big stack of clean towels). Our only real complaints were first, that the apartment is listed as 1.5 bathrooms, but there was only 1. As there were 4 of us, this wouldn't have been a deal breaker but we would have liked to know what to expect ahead of time. And second, the bed in the back bedroom was not very comfortable (front bedroom was fine, and no one slept in the middle bedroom so I can't speak for its comfort level).

It's fairly quiet inside though the front bedroom gets some traffic noise from the street -- but nothing that would interfere with sleep as long as you're used to living in a city.\n\nOne thing to note is that the apartment is on the third floor and the rear staircase is somewhat precarious.  You might want to get a street parking spot in front of the house first to unlock the door and unload large items, then move the car to the dedicated parking spot in the back.  Otherwise it takes a minute or two to walk around the block from the back to the front or vice-versa.\n\nA minor annoyance is that all the drains have fine mesh filters on them that get stuck very quickly.  We ended up having to clean out the bathroom filter pretty much every night.\n\nContrary to the description, the apartment does have a hair dryer, but did not have shampoo when we visited.  There's a drugstore across from the metro station if you need to pick anything up.\n"},{"_id":"172383890","date":{"$date":"2017-07-20T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13763013","reviewer_id":"39057316","reviewer_name":"Angela","comments":"Nice apartment in a great location.

Very close to the metro and restaurants. The outdoor terrace near the kitchen is a lovely place to have breakfast. We found the unit clean. \nSome observations. We saw 2 smoke alarms in the hanging basket. Not quite sure why they were there, but any future guest should ask about this. There was no toaster. Not quite sure if this was an oversight or are there electrical issues. They did have a portable air conditioner which provided enough cooling for the main area, but the bedrooms were warm. One of the fans did not work and another did not function as well as it should . There was not a third one.  An unusually warm time in Montreal, there needs to be better air flow in the bedrooms, which means three well functioning fans. Light switches were hard to find and some of the lights did not work. \nThe main complaint is that they listed as an amenity, a parking space. This is not true. Fortunately, the manger was there when we arrived and very graciously got in my car and helped us find a public parking space that was good until we left. Public parking is very difficult in this neighborhood, so be aware that this could be a problem.

Kitchen had all the amenities we needed. Nice size bathroom! The water pressure in the shower is very low. As a woman with medium length hair, I had to spend much more time than usual washing out my shampoo/conditioner. \n\nMy main concern is the lack of communication from the host.

Super easy to get to from the Airport, just one stop on the Aerobus. It's central and walking distance from everything - 30mins to the beach, 10mins to the park, 50mins to Sagrada Familia and 20mins from the main shopping district, nightlife and great cafes and restaurants. Her pet cat and turtle were so sweet and we basically had the apartment to ourselves as Montserrat works long evening shifts. We loved cooking in the kitchen and having a washing machine was really appreciated. Lots of great little fruit and veggie market downstairs which was perfect for our vegan diet and super affordable too! We definitely recommend this apartment and location for any singles or couples! The large bed was super comfy, the wifi was welcomed and we truly felt at home.

De plus, Montserrat nous avait mit à disposition un ventilateur ce qui était très sympa de sa part. Cependant, à noter que la douche à une faible pression et que l'eau est soit très chaude ou soit très froide (on s'y fait rapidement) + pas d'accès à ce qu'on pourrait penser être le salon qui est en faite la chambre de Montserrat et par conséquent pas d'accès au balcon.

The room itself is not huge but it is comfortable and the place was clean. The flat itself is located in Poble Sec which is a very nice area with a lot of bars and restaurants, close to the busier areas of Raval and Gotico but has still not been invaded by all the tourist masses. One thing to keep in mind is that the flat is on the top floor which you can only access by stairs. We didn't mind the extra exercise but someone else might! Added bonus is that the flat is also shared by a lovely older cat and a tortoise.

Miło przebywać w jej towarzystwie. Bardzo cenne były jej uwagi o tym, gdzie robić zakupy, gdzie zjeść lokalne pyszności i co zobaczyć w Barcelonie. Pokój, w którym mieszkaliśmy, jak i całe mieszkanie było czyściutkie, wygodne i ciche, a osobny prysznic przy sypialni był ogromnym atutem. Bardzo rzadko jeździliśmy metrem czy autobusami, gdyż mieszkanie Montserrat położone jest w centrum Barcelony. Wszędzie mogliśmy zatem dojść na nogach, zwiedzając przy okazji urocze zakątki tego miasta i poznając je od mniej oficjalnej strony.\nMontserrat, jeszcze raz dziękujemy za twoją gościnność, pomoc i wyrozumiałość.

L'entreprise de logiciels d'infographie 3D Discreet Logic a marqué le quartier en rénovant un étage d'une ancienne usine de textiles au début des années 1990. En 1997, cet espace devient les nouveaux studios montréalais du développeur de jeux vidéo Ubisoft, agrandis par la suite pour occuper la majeure partie de l'immeuble. Le Mile End est nettement plus fortuné et plus populaire depuis le milieu des années 1990 : l'augmentation des loyers et l'apparition de nouvelles boutiques haut de gamme en témoignent. Récemment, le Mile End fut considéré par plusieurs magazines musicaux spécialisés, notamment Spin et Pitchfork, comme le cœur de la scène musicale indépendante de Montréal.

Very welcoming host. Isabelle was SO thoughtful. She offered a disposable kitty litter and catnip for my cat, who quite enjoyed the stay too! \r\n\r\nThe room (and apartment) was SUPER clean and came with everything from a bathrobe to shampoos and soaps to even - and this one impressed me a lot - a PRAYER MAT. For people who need one to pray! I had NEVER seen anywhere think of providing so simple and obvious an amenity before, not even expensive hotels. It shows a level of empathy that she continued to demonstrate during the whole 10 days I stayed with her. \r\n\r\nShe's a good conversationalist and also very capable of resolving conflict calmly, which is good since there are bound to be toes stepped on when two strangers decide to live together for several days. \r\n\r\nAll in all, despite some minor awkwardness, I'd say that I had a nice stay and would recommend Isabelle's company and hospitality to anyone wanting to find low-price high-class accommodations in Montreal for a brief time.

A 20 minute walk to train station, and can walk to at least 3 hospitable and quality port wineries across the river. Train rides to Braga, Aveiro, Viana do Eastelo and Espinho are reasonable. Recommend driving thru the mountains to Peso da Regua (will need a GPS) to avoid delays thru locks on a river cruise to Regua. Figueira de Foz \u0026 Coimbra are 1 hour away by car.

La plaza de garaje es muy cómoda y correcta para el coche, tenemos un coche grande y no tuvimos problema. El apartamento es muy correcto, con armarios suficientes, y variedad de almohadas para hacer más cómoda la estancia. El salón comedor es suficientemente amplio, y muy luminoso. El sillón cama fue el punto mas flojo de toda la casa, estaba un poco trillado, y al abrirlo no quedaba completamente plano. El baño era cómodo, y nos dejo una toalla de lavabo, y tres toallas de baño, una para cada uno. La cocina, estaba bien, con una vajilla de seis cubiertos, un poco justo el menaje, pero adecuado para unas vacaciones. La cocina dispone de una terracita tendedero con una lavadora. En el recibidor, tiene información y folletos que pueden ser muy útiles. El apartamento esta cerca de un centro comercial, por si quieres hacer alguna compra para la cocina. Lo mejor de todo fue nuestra anfitriona que nos hizo una bienvenida perfecta, enseñándonos la casa, y dándonos recomendaciones para las visitas por la ciudad, estuvo pendiente por si necesitábamos algo."},{"_id":"319470434","date":{"$date":"2018-09-06T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13778742","reviewer_id":"173967635","reviewer_name":"Marie-Hélène","comments":"Excellent accueil \nUn joli appartement dans un joli quartier proche du centre et des commerces\nUne adresse à retenir"},{"_id":"322472237","date":{"$date":"2018-09-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13778742","reviewer_id":"26161408","reviewer_name":"Jeff","comments":"Great place!

Chegamos depois do horário combinado e deu tudo certo. Ela nos indicou os pontos turísticos e alguns restaurantes. O apartamento tem uma localização muito boa, mas precisa-se caminhar um pouco até os pontos turísticos. Talvez porque já estávamos um pouco cansados dos dias anteriores (em Lisboa) e com uma bebê de 2 anos, saímos sempre de carro. Eu teria escolhido um apartamento mais perto do centro e de restaurantes (como fizemos em Lisboa e que foi bastante prático).  O apartamento é ensolarado e o vidro duplo mantém a temperatura ambiente bastante agradável, além de bom isolamento acústico. Como estávamos de carro, não saímos pra passear à pé. Mas acho que o Uber seria melhor do que alugar carro pois o trânsito é lento no centro (como já se esperava). Não usamos a cozinha para refeições, porém notamos falta de chaleira. O sofá não é confortável pra descansar depois de um dia longo fora de casa, e também não gostamos dos travesseiros. Também acho que o apartamento precisa de uma limpeza profunda e a Alexandra disse que vai resolver esta questão. Já sabia, ao escolher o apartamento, que máquina de secar não havia, e pra nós fez falta."},{"_id":"326390025","date":{"$date":"2018-09-22T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13778742","reviewer_id":"91661487","reviewer_name":"B.K.","comments":"Spacious and beautiful room.

It would be also fine for 2 people, more than that in my opinion would be a little too tight. Only if one really needs to save money.\n\nThe temperature of the apartment was fine and no noise from the streets in that room. We can hear bedroom neighboors, but there weren’t many people there during my stay.\n\nThe only negative side of the place is that it’s not very friendly... No warm welcomes, charming decoration or NYC guides, maps or books to share with the guests. Traveling alone I Would have enjoyed it, but I guess ”this is NY”, deal with it, and Im sure  Tom has his reasons to put up cameras and several rules written all over the apartment. I can see that some guests have no education or respect for others.  \n\nI got an early check in for a $59 fee. And the day before my check out I got an email requesting that I left the apartment before or at 10am the latest.\n\nOverall my experience was fine and I would definately stay there again. thanks!"}]}

This part of the ocean is great for kite and windsurfing. It has a shallower beach and is not necessarily the best for sandcastles and long extended play times. The Kama’ole beaches are a very popular set of beaches for locals and visitors. (less then one mile away) Beautiful, long, 1.5 mile sandy beaches with incredible views of Molokini, Kaho’olawe and Lana’i islands. Kam III has one of the most regular South Maui shorebreaks for boogie-boarding. Snorkeling opportunities are plentiful.

He made us feel very welcome at the unit, which we appreciated.  He also replied very quickly to emails and checked in with us when we arrived and left.\r\n\r\nThe apartment itself is very well-stocked with kitchen appliances, cookware, dining essentials, and beach gear (e.g., boogie boards and beach towels).  We appreciated the convenience of the dishwasher and washer and dryer.  The grounds themselves are perfectly manicured and have many bbq grills which we used on several occasions.  The grounds are very clean and the bbq grills themselves are cleaned by the apartment complex's maintenance crew.  The grounds are right on the edge of a shore (not exactly a beach that one would go to for swimming and lounging) that provide stunning views of the water and sunset.\r\n\r\nThis apartment is a great value in that you are centrally located among different sights such as Wailea Beach and Lahaina (a 15-30 minute drive).  We would recommend renting a car so that you can drive around the island.  Very few sights would be easily accessible to you otherwise.  There are also a full bathroom for each bedroom, so you have a 2-bedroom, 2-bath apartment.  The master bedroom has a lanai the provides a good view of the island.  The second bedroom's window looks out into the dark hallway of the apartment floor though.  A free parking spot was provided for the unit, which was convenient for our rental car.  There is also a balcony off of the kitchen that provides you with a great view of the water.\r\n\r\nOverall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this unit!"},{"_id":"103472856","date":{"$date":"2016-09-22T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13814845","reviewer_id":"2203659","reviewer_name":"Tiffany","comments":"The listing is in a great location with an incredible pool and great place to watch the sunset.

The studio is 2 minutes from Taksim square and therefore close to the main restaurant area and shopping  streets in this region and 20mins from Galata tower. Taksim also has decent public transportation opportunities to go to other places in the city. Additionally, the apartment was just 5mins from the Havabüs shuttle busses to the Sabiha Gökçen Airport. The studio is small and cute and had everything that I  needed and Ergun was quick to respond and a really nice guy. The only minor comments I have would be the noise from the busy street outside and the mosque. I would also recommend Ergun to provide some extra blankets for the colder evenings in autumn/wintertime :)."},{"_id":"348734662","date":{"$date":"2018-11-15T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13827870","reviewer_id":"80836964","reviewer_name":"Chaeyun","comments":"탁심광장 옆이라 위치는 최상이었습니다.\n밤에 방안에서 예쁜 야경을 볼수 있습니다.\n화장실에서 냄새가 좀 심합니다. 그것만 아니면 가격 대비 좋은 장소라고 생각합니다."},{"_id":"352311499","date":{"$date":"2018-11-25T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13827870","reviewer_id":"158314318","reviewer_name":"Ali","comments":"Nice place, host is super nice, and the location is the best!"},{"_id":"360299033","date":{"$date":"2018-12-20T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13827870","reviewer_id":"101681962","reviewer_name":"Arwa","comments":"Ergun is fantastic host..

We very much enjoyed the fact that it was so close to the metro so getting into town was very convenient. \nCommunication with Sérgio was great and he was very helpful.\n\nAlthough we had a great experience, we have a couple of remarks. The stairs to the top floor were a little scary to walk (and very scary to have our child walk) - so perhaps installing a banister would help. We thought the apartment was overall very clean, but the floor was not (downstairs)... so if you like to take off your shoes indoor, you will get dirty feet. While the house is very close to the metro, parts of the neighborhood seemed a little unsafe at night (though in the house, which is walled, you do feel secure)."},{"_id":"175190775","date":{"$date":"2017-07-28T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13841305","reviewer_id":"89227215","reviewer_name":"Isabela","comments":"A casa é maravilhosa.

Entsprechend aufwendig ist die Ausstattung und vor allem ziemlich komplett. Es gibt sogar Platz zum Spielen für die Kinder, einen Abstellplatz für ein Auto und einen großen Außenbereich mit Grill und Hängematte. Gerade für eine große Familie und für längere Aufenthalte hat das Haus ein geniales Preis-/Leistungsverhältnis. Wer die Ruhe eines Silence-Hotels sucht, wäre in der Nähe des Stadions und der Nähe des angrenzenden Verkehrs nicht gut aufgehoben. Im 1. OG gibt es eine Klimaanlage!  Im Haus sind zwei Bäder. Es ist alles neu. \nBesonders hervorzuheben ist die Person des Vermieters selbst. Er war wirklich wie ein privater Gastgeber, hat uns geholfen und sogar gute Tipps für den Aufenthalt gegeben. So etwas ist am Anfang sehr wichtig. so eine umfangreiche Hilfe wird man selten finden. Sein Angebot zur Unterstützung ist auch sehr ernst gemeint. \nEs gibt hinter dem Stadion ein großes Einkauszentrum. Der Foodbereich ist im UG.

We do live in London though, so are used to some background noise. Brilliant that you have safe, secure off street parking. Would highly recommend visiting Sergio's property.

Looks just like the pictures. Unfortunately, I cannot say my stay was pleasant. The room gets HOT in the summer. It does not have windows, and air conditioning was not installed until June 23rd (I moved in on May 7th). I left the air on overnight because I didn't know I was supposed to turn it off (I've had central air my whole life, and from my discussions with other people, I don't think turning off a window unit at night is necessarily normal either). When Anna realized I was leaving it on, instead of having a civil adult conversation with me, she screamed at me and insulted me, calling me immature and telling me I didn't have any common sense (because in her opinion turning AC off at night, even when it is 100 degrees outside, is \"common sense\"). After this incident, I turned the AC off and didn't touch it again. Someone else moved in to the other airbnb room she has listed, and started using the AC. This new guest also left it on overnight. Instead of speaking with the new guest, Anna waited for me at the front door until I left for work, and followed me out of the house screaming at me and calling me stupid and immature again. So yes the place is nice, but definitely not worth what I had to deal with. Also, the neighborhood is definitely not the safest, especially for a young woman.

You're in a beautiful area of the Upper West Side. There is a shared bathroom but it was never a problem. Not once did I find the other person who uses it using it when I wanted to. And while the amenities in the bathroom are old, I found them to be quite clean. Otherwise, the bed is comfy and the table area large enough to do laptop work. The building itself has a (very cheap) laundry room in the basement should you need it. Murilo makes every effort to make sure you're doing well, and even will have a cup of coffee with you if you're so inclined to have him show you the city a bit. My only complaint would be that the WiFi is a bit slow, but that's really it. I felt safe and secure in this cozy studio. Would recommend to anyone looking for a great deal.

He gave me a lot of useful information upfront and checked on me throughout my trip to ensure everything was going well.\n\nThis listing had a shared bathroom which was clearly posted in the listing i must have just missed it. The bathroom was clean and i never ran into issues with it being occupied. I did not like the shared bathroom situation though. It was a tad uncomfortable having to leave the apartment to use the restroom. I felt like i needed to lock up the apartment everytime i used the bathroom just in case. Not only was my stuff in the apartment but Murilos as well. Again, this was clearly posted in the listing so this was not Murilos fault. \n\nI didn't bother using the elevator after the first day. There is only one covering the whole building and its very slow so i just took the stairs. The common hallway area smelled really bad like food and cigarettes at all times. Murilos apartment smells just fine so no worries there!!\n\nThe best part about this unit is the location!!! You are walking distance to anything you may need (market, dining, shopping, Central Park, etc). Its a short walk to Central Park which is amazing and its also walking distance to Midtown. There is a subway station right next to the unit so you can take the subway as well. \n\nOverall i enjoyed my experience at Murilos. The only thing keeping me from booking again is the bathroom."},{"_id":"124751663","date":{"$date":"2017-01-02T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13846473","reviewer_id":"87149658","reviewer_name":"Marcelo","comments":"O espaço é excelente, limpo, organizado e bem localizado.

This was their first trip to Sydney and they were blown away by the location. We walked a few blocks down Blues Point Rd to catch the ferry and the view was spectacular. The iconic vistas of Sydney, being the Harbour Bridge, Opera House and Luna Park were just a stones throw away.\nWe didn't take cars with us and spent the entire trip using the readily accessible public transport for trips across the harbour to the CBD.\nThe best part about the location was NOT being in the CBD but still super close. A night ferry across to Darling Harbour for dinner was tourist perfection.\nWe started a game amongst the 9 of us to try and figure out 2 things...1) The original use of the building before it became accommodation and 2) getting to know our host by investigating the furnishings, artworks and books in the library. Although we'll never know the real answers, we had a great time discovering the eclectic array of furnishings, the amazing variety and quality of the art and sculptures as well as the interesting use of antiques and curios. \nI enjoyed time in the library combing through the broad spectrum of books and journals on hand. \nOverall, a wonderful stay in a truly imaginative residential space. Well done Vanessa."},{"_id":"226871705","date":{"$date":"2018-01-12T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13852692","reviewer_id":"60266623","reviewer_name":"Edward","comments":"Very spacious, design-forward home In a fabulous neighborhood.

There were dehumidifiers (3) in the rooms running when we arrived to remove moisture I assume. \n\nI opted not to stay there on the eve of my wedding (which I planned to) due to the mildew smell but they coped with it (being  from interstate ) and it was ok half way through their stay after they left the doors and windows open for 2 days. \n\nThe host was very understanding, sent a property manager to inspect and offered me a partial refund however this ultimately isn’t a solution and it was too hard to move everyone."},{"_id":"269134130","date":{"$date":"2018-05-27T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13852692","reviewer_id":"55339276","reviewer_name":"Lisa","comments":"Great location , large roomy spaces with eclectic furnishings and artwork to enjoy .

This was a great warehouse conversion home. Victoria was great and communicated well. I stayed here with some work colleagues and it was a perfect space for us to have our own space and also socialise. Everyone said their beds and stay was good, there were just a couple of things that they were uncomfortable with and that's a couple of open windows and see-through curtains that looked straight onto the street, one of the rooms was clearly damp and the person who stayed there was sensitive to damp and mould, unfortunately. The common share bathroom facilities didn't have a lock on the door and the toilet door didn't have a separate lock so a few were uncomfortable with that.
