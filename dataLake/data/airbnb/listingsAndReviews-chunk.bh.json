You can easily take subway to get to places for shopping and eating.

As for the size, it's pretty okay for 7 ladies like us, maybe a little bit smaller to accommodate male guests. But it's reasonable since it's in Hong Kong.

The place is very clean, modern, and has a panoramic view of the ocean. The two bedrooms and two full bathrooms make it perfect for a family of four. It is on the top (third) floor, but because the parking lot and entry are on the uphill side, you only need to climb one flight of stairs. The kitchen works well, and includes a dishwasher. A washer and drier right in the apartment make doing laundry very convenient. The condo seems to be in a safe and friendly neighborhood, and is very quiet at night, apart from the chorus of chirping frogs at dusk. During our stay, we found plenty of beach towels, and a handy ice chest. We liked returning to the cooler higher altitude after a hot day at the beach. There are a lot of good restaurants in the area to discover, and it seems that local organic foods has really caught on in a big way. Robert was very responsive to all of our questions and needs. We definitely would stay here again."},{"_id":"43617380","date":{"$date":"2015-08-21T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2706978","reviewer_id":"31097883","reviewer_name":"Rachel","comments":"Robert was very responsive and helpful.

He sent a note just before our departure and then followed up during our stay to ensure everything was as it should be. His directions from the airport were very clear and accurate, as were several tips and suggestions he passed on to us prior to our arrival.\r\n\r\nThe condo is as represented in the photos and the listing. The location was perfect for us, providing a comfortable base for daytime exploration and a welcome refuge in the evening. We used the kitchen a fair bit for breakfast and most evening meals, so really the full range with oven and refrigerator were truly appreciated. Since we are only two people, we washed our dishes by hand after each meal and didn't use the dishwasher. There are lots of pots and pans, knives, spatulas, etc, in addition to dishes, glassware and cutlery, that we found extremely helpful. \r\n\r\nThe bed in the master bedroom has just the right bit of firmness for us. Hot water was always available in both showers.\r\n\r\nHaving in-suite laundry was such a treat. This meant we could arrive with less luggage and recycle the clothing we did bring. Since we were there almost 2 weeks, we were very happy to find and use the Swiffer mop.\r\n\r\nWe enjoyed the lanai most morning and evenings. It was so nice to have that extra 'room.'\r\n\r\nHaving wireless reliable internet access and cable TV was so helpful (we were tracking Storm Juno prior to our return to the East Coast) and highly appreciated. We also were able to keep up with Downton Abbey!\r\n\r\nThis was our first experience on the Big Island and we hope to return sometime in the future. If \u0026 when we do, we hope Robert will welcome us back!\r\n\r\n"},{"_id":"81711236","date":{"$date":"2016-06-24T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2706978","reviewer_id":"59513022","reviewer_name":"Mike","comments":"Overall, our experience was wonderful.

When we were at the condo, every time we wondered if something was there it always was. Ice chest-yes, iron-yes, ice trays-yes, snorkel-yes, beach chairs-yes, beach towels-yes.

My friends and I who stayed here really liked it and enjoyed the space. I forgot there were 2 bathrooms (bonus) and a nice space to 'hang out' after exploring the island. It was nice to have a larger TV as well. All pooped out and having access to some TV, downtime was nice. We used our Fire to stream our content and was nice background noise while we played games. The location is nice. The condo (and it is a full condo on the top floor - nice) is a bit higher on the mountain (think it is a mountain) and is much cooler than by the beach. This is good to know since it may seem cloud at the condo but the beach is sunny. LOL. \n\nWe didn't realize how awesome this bnb was until we experienced a different airbnb on Oahu which might have been a little misleading. This is a full condo - no sharing space with the owner. You have space all to yourself.  This was not a house converted into different living space, it is a condo. It is also good that it is on the top floor. We hardly heard the neighbors except for weekends when the neighbors were outside and we had the windows open.\n\nRecommend this place for sure and if and when we come back, we will certainly look this place up."},{"_id":"262428076","date":{"$date":"2018-05-08T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2706978","reviewer_id":"52123511","reviewer_name":"Karen","comments":"My sister and I had a fantastic time at this condo.

We have a family of 5 (two adults and three children). The bathroom is very large, has a separate tub and shower and double vanity, which makes up for the fact that we all were sharing one bathroom. Beds were comfortable. The condo has AC, which we discovered we needed after trying to go without AC for a night. Two boys shared a bed in the second bedroom, and our daughter slept on the pull-out sofa in the living area. Linens were provided and were tucked away in the coffee table storage. \nHaving three TVs was great when kids wanted to watch different shows. The washer and dryer in the unit were very convenient. We were provided with enough towels for all of us but also could wash them when needed. \nThe resort was very nice. The pools are beautiful. The kids especially loved the pool with a slide. Parking was convenient. Location was great —ten minutes from Lahaina. \nI also went to the spa onsite and had a massage. One of the best massages I’ve had. \nPool and beach toys were available, but we didn’t use them. Overall, we had everything we needed for an awesome week. \nI would highly recommend Jill’s condo and hope to go back soon."},{"_id":"400641619","date":{"$date":"2019-01-12T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"27194870","reviewer_id":"120493024","reviewer_name":"Lisa","comments":"An amazing Maui experience.

The bed or should we say \"the cloud\"... is amazing! \r\nA few steps to get to the subway and, in 15 minutes, you're eating oysters in Manhattan!\r\nOverall, we loved the Airbnb experience and recommend Valerie's place to everyone who wants to find the best way to discouver Brooklyn. \r\nFinally, the famous last word goes to Valerie.

I also really enjoyed this location - we traveled into Manhattan everyday on the subway and found it to be an easy commute with multiple lines we could take. We wished we had more time to try some of the nearby restaurants in the Fort Greene neighborhood and loved being next to the park. The only downside we experienced was that the A/C units hadn't been installed when we arrived and high temperatures were in the mid- to upper-80s that weekend, which made the apartment pretty toasty even at night. However, Valerie messaged me about the issue afterward and I don't expect that to be a recurring issue. Overall, Valerie was a responsive, thoughtful, and responsible host, and I recommend her apartment as a comfortable, clean, nicely appointed and conveniently located place to stay in NYC.

The apartment is basic but nicely decorated and more than adequate for a visit to NYC. The price is great for what you get and I'd recommend this in a heartbeat.\n\nOne significant hitch: there was a heat wave and A/C units had not yet been installed, and I was unable to get a hold of the handyman to install them (apparently he was out of town). The apartment is warmer than the outside temp even with windows open and shades drawn. Given the heat -- 96 fahrenheit -- I had to eventually book another place. However, Valerie was incredibly kind and refunded my entire stay, and was communicative throughout despite not being in the country at the time. Had it not been for the A/C issue and surrounding misfortune that the handyman was not around, I am sure it would have been a flawless stay."}]}

We booked it the night before and it fit our needs. We were given a nice tour upon arrival. There was plenty of pamphlets with info on things to do in Barcelona. Here my friend and I found a bike tour we would not have found otherwise--the bike tour was the highlight of our trip! Wifi worked best in the living room--not very well on our own room. The kitchen area was nice. We didn't use much because we only stayed one night. Other people are staying here too so it was a little loud but not too bad. Our bed was comfortable. The people running the place live right downstairs if you have questions, so that is great. Thank you for a great place to stay in Barcelona for a night!

She explained everything to us, however in a manner that was not quite welcoming, but neither unfriendly. At the end of our stay we asked if we could leave our baggage there, because we were departing in the evening, and that was no problem, which was nice. \r\nThe neighborhood is fine - things are not quite in a walking distance (for example to the Ramblas it is about  1 1/2 km), but you can reach everthing with the subway. The station Poble Sec is around the corner, a bit less than 5 minutes walking. \r\nThe room itself was OK, it was spacious and bright, but there were also some defects. For example there are no wardrobe and no beside tables. So in the few days we were there all our clothes that we unpacked (we travelled with backpackes) laid either on the bed or on the makeshift \"wardrobe\" (which is more or less a hallstand with a little place where the extra blanket was). Really a problem to fix. Minor problem: I had my difficulties to lock up the door. About the other rooms: the bathrooms were rather dirty, the shower, as well as the water-tap and the mirror. The size of the bathrooms is nice and also there is no problem getting along with the other guests because there are two. Kitchen: we didn't use it very much, but it was fine, everything there you needed. \r\nThe apartment as a whole was OK, but nothing more and for me not worth the price, sorry.

This is run like a 4 bedroom hostel. Very badly run down. Although it had everything you needed for a very basic stay make No mistake that this is a private hostel run under the ABnB banner. We never met the hosts, and we were given a 2 minute introduction to the room. I.e. Keys and location of bathrooms etc. from there we had to wing everything. Not the experience we expected as we are traveling Europe and have used ABnB many times with great experiences. But this was the worst we have experienced. The Brazilian girl looking after the rooms was great but the apartment was not worth the amount asked for. Had it been advertised as a hostel then we would be aware of where we were booking but this was not it.

During probably the busiest weekend in Montreal due to Osheaga music festival, another AirBnB host canceled last minute, leaving my friends and I without a place to stay. With the help of AirBnB and Marine, she accommodated a large group of my friends to stay last minute. She responded immediately and was in touch during the entire re-booking process. She and her boyfriend Damien bought us a bottle of wine to welcome us into their home, provided us multiple pairs of keys and checked up on whenever we needed. Best of all, the place is in a super cool and spacious loft, with really fun and interesting decor. I 100% recommend anyone considering to visit Montreal to stay with Marine. I know if I'm coming back to Osheaga next year, I certainly will.\n\n- Wensen "},{"_id":"306457598","date":{"$date":"2018-08-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"27366716","reviewer_id":"143205710","reviewer_name":"Isaac","comments":"Good location, clean, professional, very open to accommodating specific needs and requests."},{"_id":"310401757","date":{"$date":"2018-08-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"27366716","reviewer_id":"205372624","reviewer_name":"Ana","comments":"Great location"},{"_id":"311591684","date":{"$date":"2018-08-21T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"27366716","reviewer_id":"208123015","reviewer_name":"Mana","comments":"Marine is a really supportive host and try to solve and address any inquiry asap"},{"_id":"312458139","date":{"$date":"2018-08-23T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"27366716","reviewer_id":"26240694","reviewer_name":"Jonathan","comments":"Great location and nice space.

If I had known this I would not have booked this location.  We only had one real queen size bed and one single bed. that only sleeps 3 people.  The air mattress provided was subpar and deflated thus two out of five guests had to sleep on a deflated mattress. The airbnb was not fit for a 5 person stay.  I don't know how the listing is for 7 people.\n\nChecked in at 330pm, but the sheets and towels were not ready. The host indicated that the sheets and towels were still being dried.  I agreed that it was ok, but when I got there, the sheets and towels in the dryer were still wet and I needed to dry them a few more cycles before it was ready for use.   Check in was listed at 3pm, the apartment should have been ready for that time, so I don't see how it is acceptable to have the apartment not ready by 330pm.\n\nHost had provided a solution to us and suggested to give us a discount for our stay, I have yet to hear back from them upon writing this review.\n\nI hope they fix these issues, as the apartment space and location has a lot of potential to be a great airbnb for future guests.\n\nThanks,\nJet"},{"_id":"319522670","date":{"$date":"2018-09-06T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"27366716","reviewer_id":"46181282","reviewer_name":"Alex","comments":"Great location!

Marine was almost always available if we needed help and gave some recommandation for where to go (Website hidden by Airbnb) Con: furnitures and cabinets were all run down falling apart or peeling. The cleaner didn't do a good job and there were lots of random specs of black stuff on the ground and hair on the sink.  Found a few bugs (not bed bugs) on one of the mattress. Had 2 comforters for 4 beds so my mom was really cold even with several of the small fleece blankets provided. No toilet paper and had to drive around the city to find a supermarket that was still open after 10 ( this after a grueling 12hr drive so you'll have to forgive me for being nitpicky), but marine reinbursed us for it. She also gave us a small reinbursement for all the trouble. Half my family didn't stay as they had an one year old and it really wasnt safe for her to be there (kept trying to eat the black stuff off the ground) so we had to pay for a hotel room as it was too late to book any new airbnb at10pm. Check out was a bit difficult as we couldn't find a time to meet and i couldn't drive to her place to drop off the keys, in the end she allowed us to leave it in the house (Website hidden by Airbnb) All in all i would recommand this place to small group of friends who just want a place to stay and didn't really care much about the above things ( and i don't  mean that negatively, some ppl just wants to come and sight see and  party in montreal and this would be great for them) maybe also for small families of 4 with kids older than 5. Or 2 pairs of couple. Marine was nice to try to accommodate my family of 6 but this was just not a good fit."},{"_id":"368318626","date":{"$date":"2019-01-06T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"27366716","reviewer_id":"131925101","reviewer_name":"Kirollos","comments":"Marine was a wonderful host!

The apartment has a living room and patio that overlook Av. Wilderton; the airy bedrooms are facing an alley, so guests have privacy and quiet, while still enjoying plenty of sunshine; the queen-sized bed was very comfortable. The inclusive tree-lined neighborhood (with its synagogues, yeshivas, and churches) is charming, quiet, and safe; it is a 20-minute leisurely walk (or 10min ride on the 161 Bus) to Outremont station where one can find trendy cafes, restaurants, and a Mamie Clafoutis boulangerie; Côte des Neiges, with its many Asian restaurants, is also close by. Eat-in meals are very doable; ingredients can be purchased at the Metro Wilderton supermarket (that is just a 2-minute walk away), and prepared in the the well-appointed kitchen. Guests with cars will find free street parking in the surrounding streets.\n\nJuliana and Rogerio are fantastic hosts. They are not only friendly, helpful and responsive, but also keep their home spotless, while being eco-conscious. If late check-out is required, Juliana and Rogerio will do their best to accommodate.

But you should keep in mind that the rooms (2 bedrooms and living-room) are not real rooms. Looks like it was 1 big room and they made some separation walls - those walls have a gap to the ceiling about 1 meter. So no real privacy. And actually very noisy from the street (how it comes noone mention it before me?). I used earplugs - so much noise.\r\nThis was the first time (of about 10 time renting via airbnb) I didn't enjoy communicating with the host. Manuel asked for 35 euro (in cash) for late check-in. I think that it's normal practice, but it should be in the home rules! Otherwise it's not nice. And Manuel was out of town (since the day after we ariived) and can't (or did't want to) help us with the appartment (no soap and no wash liquid). He just answered in the end of the day \"sorry I'm out of town\". I think that if host is out of town - he should be able to arrange some people to help guests while he can't do it by himself.

Manuel arrived at our pre-arranged time to give us the keys and explain a few details, such as how to operate the wifi. He was very welcoming and told us a bit about Barcelona. \r\nThe apartment felt safe - there were 3 locked doors to get in. We enjoy walking and felt safe walking in this neighbourhood. There are many interesting places to visit within walking distance, such as the Eixample area, La Rambla, and the National Art Museum. However if you are not a walker, cabs are easy to hail - cabs with a green light indicate they are available for hire. \r\nThe suite is represented accurately in the photos. The supply of linens and towels was ample. The apartment is near a busy road which generates traffic noise at night - this may disturb light sleepers. Our first night was a Saturday night which might be a noisier night or we may have been suffering from jet-lag, but our sleep was disrupted. The rest of the week I slept well.\r\nThe bathroom is an ensuite off the master bedroom. Because we are family we were okay with this arrangement, but some people may feel uncomfortable passing through a room with sleeping people to use the toilet in the night.\r\nThere are loads of nearby shops to pick up groceries and other supplies such as hand soap, dish detergent, and toilet paper. \r\nOverall, the apartment was clean and it suited our needs well. I would stay again if I visit Barcelona again.

Her house is spacious, bright, and very comfortable. There were four of us but this apartment has plenty of room for more. It was very comfortable with ceiling fans in each room. Samantha and her family live right upstairs but you'd never know it because they are so quiet. \n\nSamantha is a very attentive and generous host. She had fresh fruit waiting for us with new fruit each day. She is proud of her area and eager to share insider tips on where to go and where to shop. We swam at quiet beaches only the locals know about.  Samantha provides plenty of beach towels. After a long day at the Polynesian Cultural  Center, it was great to be able to drive just five minutes and go to sleep!\n\nWe loved the time we spent with Samantha and feel like we have a new friend in Hawaii.

It was such a pleasure to meet Samantha in the flesh, she had gone out of her way to meet my needs (I was travelling to O'ahu for a friend's wedding with my active toddler) \u0026 was helpful and discreet. The property itself met our needs perfectly - asides from being self-contained, allowing me to cater to my toddler - it was immaculately clean \u0026 on the ground floor. We slept like logs in the comfy beds, able to eat like at home when we cooked for ourselves \u0026 the additional touch of leaving ample reading material for us was  just such a welcome surprise - thank you!

The home is spacious, comfortable, clean, and so peaceful. It is a bit of a drive back to the Honolulu side, but definitely worth the tranquil surroundings, and easy commute to the world famous North Shore.  There is a grocery store, and several small eateries around the corner, and the white sandy beaches of Waimea Bay are a short drive away. Everything you need in one perfect little paradise package!

She really went over and beyond too as my son had his birthday there and she allowed her children to come to a small party. I also did some online shopping and she was okay with mail being sent. A million times better than any hotel if you'd rather save your money :-) Insider tips- don't panic about no local Safeway - it is all Foodland on that part of the Island. Try the Laie Palms family cinema. Also a very small rock pool on the closest beach was awesome for small kids.

Our most difficult problem was the lighting: only overhead lights and no reading lamps by the beds or in the living room. We're readers and we greatly missed having reading lights.\r\n     The driveway was difficult for us - we had to  back down the length of it in a large and unfamiliar rented car.  It was hard to do!

I recommend Samantha's place if you need a place to stay for a large group of people."},{"_id":"90013592","date":{"$date":"2016-07-30T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2741869","reviewer_id":"22511132","reviewer_name":"Jane","comments":"Good location for north island explore, very clean and good communication."},{"_id":"91082303","date":{"$date":"2016-08-03T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2741869","reviewer_id":"55622793","reviewer_name":"Julie","comments":"The neighborhood was a quite family oriented neighborhood as described in the original posting.

It is a spacious accommodation, great for large family gatherings and the like, in a good location with easy access to many North Shore sites. There is no A/C in the house (actually, there a couple of machines but they weren't working during our stay) and it can get muggy at times, especially during the day. There is usually a breeze, but if you don't like humid conditions, and if you plan to spend a lot of time in the house and not out and about, this may not be the place for you.

It wasn't fancy but it was clean and the kitchen was well-stocked with cooking utensils, pots, pans, etc as well as many staples such as cooking oil etc.  Hauula was a little more isolated than I realized, (so finding places to eat took a little creativity), and the street felt a little run-down.

Kauloa Ranch and the Byodo-In temple are about 20 minutes south.  It takes about an hour to get to Waikiki, which can be seen as either a bonus or a drawback.

We felt like we were coming home at the end of each day. The home is clean, very quiet and very comfortable. Having AC was a plus as it got hot and muggy in the middle of August. The neighborhood is awesome, we loved all the nearby restaurants (especially Anejo) and the bars (especially The Pony Bar and On The Rocks). There are a couple deli/convenience stores that stay open 24 hours very close by as well.  We felt very safe walking home, often in the middle of the night. It's nice having doormen in the building as well. Times Square is a short 10 min walk. The subway stations are the same. Alex was very communicative and available for any questions. We appreciated his recommendations and he made us feel welcomed. Would recommend Alex's apt highly!

Collecting the keys from the doorman worked perfectly and Alex had left useful information in the flat.\r\nThe area is busy and there is a lot of construction work going on but the building itself is lovely, doormen are always there so it is safe and secure. We were never disturbed by noise from outside or inside the apartment, it is moments away from the hustle and bustle of 10th Avenue but it was very peaceful once inside the building. \r\nThe apartment is lovely too, very spacious well furnished and equipped- it was just like home which was wonderful when returning from a busy sightseeing day!\r\nThe location is great, not pretty exactly but so interesting and safe, near to many restaurants and bars and only 10 minutes away from subways.\r\nSome places we enjoyed are: Bubby's at the Meatpacking end of the High Line, The Jolly Monk ( a Belgian Bar and Grill) on the corner of 47th and 9th, Times Square Diner (great for breakfast- they will swap potatoes for a bowl of berries!) it's not actually on Times Square, it's between 48th and 49th on 8th Ave.\r\nWe had a wonderful stay in Alex's delightful apartment, the photos and description don't fully do it justice, we would definitely stay again if he'd have us!"},{"_id":"19728974","date":{"$date":"2014-09-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2748064","reviewer_id":"18524300","reviewer_name":"Nicole","comments":"We could not have picked a better place to stay on our first visit to New York.

It was very comfortable, clean and homey. The queen size bed was comfortable and bathroom shower was awesome, super hot water, great water pressure (that's important to me lol) the doormen were very polite. It was a safe area. About 11 minutes away from time square (walking) and we hopped on the trains for everything! (I suggest getting an unlimited train and bus pass for however long you're in the city.) Some great restaurants we really enjoyed in the area were pio pio (Spanish food), becco (Italian) \u0026 a small deli called skyline gourmet deli.

We walked in about 10-15 mins. to the subway, 20 mins. to Times Square, 10-15 mins. to Intrepid, and even locations as Central Park or High Line and Chelsea Market are possible walking distances if you are a little used to moving your legs.

They were generous hosts too, sharing the wonderful fruits grown on the property and free-range chicken eggs freely. The breakfasts were creative and plentiful, lots of fresh fruit, followed by interesting and delicious dishes that flowed from their well-traveled and catering experiences. Their special qualities are complimented by the fabulous home in the coffee-growing hills overlooking Kona bay, where you can lounge on the lanai with a glass of wine (or fruit juice) and watch the sun set and feel the scented cool breeze caressing your sunburnt skin. It's paradise in paradise."},{"_id":"159373679","date":{"$date":"2017-06-10T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2748736","reviewer_id":"13915687","reviewer_name":"Carol","comments":"Shai was friendly and helpful. Loved the breakfasts on the lanais overlooking kona. Sunsets were beautiful! Rooms were clean, comfortable.  Able to use kitchen common to other guests to store our food, fruit. Loved visiting Shai's coffee field and fruit trees below the inn. His home- grown avocados were the biggest we've ever seen! Shai greeted us with a delicious papaya /banana smoothie and some avocado w bread. This was so welcomed after a long day of traveling and hiking! There are cool breezes at the inn all day as you are up high in mountain above Kona. Very quiet at night. Driveway steep, but paved. Very nice experience.

While others have met Paula’s mother, Paula oriented me. She was waiting with a warm greeting on the front doorstep – even though my train was late – when I arrived in my taxi [8 Euros – have change!] It is a comfortable, elegant, stylish and cool refuge. Almost everything you may need has been provided – you just need your hairdryer and bathroom toiletries. Reliable WIFI. It is located close to Rua Santa Caterina (main shopping boulevard) and Rua Formosa in the city centre. The fully renovated studio apartment is housed in an historic building on the FIRST floor [for those with heavy luggage like mine] with a grand entry, polished marble stairs and features glorious space with 15ft ceilings and gigantic windows. They open to a petite balconette with a small table setting for those who smoke, or for drying travel laundry securely. At night I opened the shuttered doors to let in the cooling evening breeze. It is a short walk to the traveller’s friend – the pingo doce supermarket and the Via Caterina shopping centre. Down the hill at 58 Formosa you will find the traditional market - \"Mercado do Bolhao\" - the Bolhao Market. I can also recommend a charming, family restaurant hosted enthusiastically by the son. It has an excellent budget menu – “economico” - Restaurante Don Rodrigo, in our street @ no. 37/39. For 5.50 Euros – vegetable soup \u0026 bread / meat or fish main / ½ litre wine (drink choice) and coffee. [See trip advisor reviews]. It also has a quaint outdoor patio \u0026 courtyard garden. The landmarks for “home” – Ibis Hotel, Residential Gabriel, Garage Elephante, Aquario (electronic shops). Paula also made life easier by booking a taxi back to the train station and kindly sent me text messages confirming our arrangements.

The apt. is as shown in the add. It is very tastefully decorated and uses the small space well. It is all you need for a week or two stay and it is located around the corner from the metro stop. You can also walk to the center or to the river from the apt. We had some lovely breakfasts on the terrace, which is definitely a plus. The kitchen has all you need for meals, including a refrigerator, burners and electric heating items. The bed is super comfortable as were the pillows, showing that the host put a lot into selecting items for comfort. I even want to see if I can buy the pillows. Paula, the host, was very flexible with the time for check in for I didn't know up until the day what bus I was taking from Fatima. She met us and there was a glass of wine for my husband and I, a nice touch. There was also a map of Porto, which was helpful and she was available for any questions. The shower works well and provides consistent hot water. The towels were soft and very adequate. The cost was extremely reasonable. You really can't get a lovely room with a terrace close to all the attractions at this rate. I would highly recommend it.

And Porto is just great. \nPaula's mother was really kind when we arrived and we really enjoyed the porto wine Paula offered to us. \nThe apartment is clean and cozy. Perfect for two people. \nWe recommend it.\n\nThank you Paula.\n\n\n"},{"_id":"17249435","date":{"$date":"2014-08-09T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2758817","reviewer_id":"19217419","reviewer_name":"Marie Charlotte","comments":"Bel appartement.

El día anterior también sabía de nuestra llegada y recibimos un correo suyo indicándonos que la avisáramos 45 min. antes de llegar,  pues bien, así lo hicimos, mandamos un email avisando que llegaríamos sobre las 12,30, pero nadie contactó con nosotros hasta las 14,30h.\r\n\r\nFinalmente una persona al servicio de Paula nos llamó, después de que nosotros, hubiéramos intentado contactar al tfno que Airbnb nos facilitó de Paula repetidas veces, pero siempre estaba apagado.\r\n\r\nPor fin llegó una asistenta con las llaves, fue super amable y se disculpó por el incidente.\r\n\r\nPaula tengo que decirte que dicho incidente, nos causó bastantes problemas, teníamos el equipaje en el coche, necesitamos poner tickets de aparcamiento cada hora, el apartamento no está muy céntrico,  tampoco está en una zona muy recomendable, por lo que hasta que no llegaron con las llaves, no pudimos visitar la ciudad con tranquilidad. \r\n\r\nTan solo se trataba de comunicar con nosotros y recibir las instrucciones necesarias, por ejemplo, si nos dicen que no podían llegar antes de las 14,30h,  no me parece correcto, porque al día siguiente teníamos que dejar la habitación-estudio a las 12,00h, pero..., hubiéramos planificado nuestro tiempo de otra manera. \r\n\r\nUna vez dentro, hay que ser sinceros, la habitación-estudio es espaciosa, agradable y muy limpia.

Exactly what we expected and wanted!  The cute room is very clean and perfect for a couple.  The bathroom is a lovely typical european bath and the kitchenette has everything you would need.  The location is OUTSTANDING!  Very easy to get to the apartment from the metro from the airport!  A quick walk to the main pedestrian street for a lovely breakfast in the sun and that easy metro station so handy.  If you take the wonderful Taste Porto Food tour, it starts on the corner of the main pedestrian street very close to the house.  I highly recommend you do that when you arrive!  We walked everywhere - down to the water and over the bridge - from the apartment.  Would stay here again in a heartbeat.  Getting the key was very easy and Paula responds quickly to all messages.

We had a bit of trouble with check-in and getting our car parked in the courtyard and had to wait up the street for about 15 minutes before getting a response. Location was excellent. It’s only a couple blocks from a main shopping street with restaurants and shops. The parking was convenient. You’ll need to have a small car if you want to park in the courtyard. The bed was super comfortable. Soft and plush. I personally liked the big pillows, but my husband did not (he prefers flat pillows). The water pressure in the shower was amazing. Plenty of hot water as well. There is a little balcony that overlooks the courtyards. You may even see a random cat lying on a brick wall. The building was a little noisy at night. We could hear other guests going up the stairs and having full conversations. The apartment door isn’t very thick so it doesn’t block the sound from the staircase. We occasionally heard a dog barking outside as well. Bring earplugs for sleeping, if you are a light sleeper. Apartment was clean and bright though. Only thing that would have been nice is to have a roll of paper towels. We brought back food and it would have been nice to have paper towels (since we didn’t have any napkins). \n\nOverall, great place to stay. We enjoyed Porto and this apartment was central to most things.

An earlier Airbnb venture was most successful and enjoyable, and it was so good to read of my guests pleasure and appreciation.  I hope I can achieve this standard once again as I welcome guests in 2018......I will certainly be doing my best to make every stay a great experience.","host_response_time":"within an hour","host_thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/9565852/profile_pic/1382511830/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","host_picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/9565852/profile_pic/1382511830/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","host_neighbourhood":"Annandale/Leichhardt","host_response_rate":100,"host_is_superhost":true,"host_has_profile_pic":true,"host_identity_verified":true,"host_listings_count":3,"host_total_listings_count":3,"host_verifications":["email","phone","reviews","jumio","government_id"]},"address":{"street":"Leichhardt, NSW, Australia","suburb":"Annandale/Leichhardt","government_area":"Leichhardt","market":"Sydney","country":"Australia","country_code":"AU","location":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[151.14584,-33.88548],"is_location_exact":false}},"availability":{"availability_30":0,"availability_60":0,"availability_90":0,"availability_365":0},"review_scores":{"review_scores_accuracy":10,"review_scores_cleanliness":10,"review_scores_checkin":10,"review_scores_communication":10,"review_scores_location":10,"review_scores_value":10,"review_scores_rating":100},"reviews":[{"_id":"347123076","date":{"$date":"2018-11-10T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"27590773","reviewer_id":"210320474","reviewer_name":"Brian","comments":"If you stay in this apartment and feel that it is not up to the standard you are expecting then you are the type of person who expects to buy a Rolls Royce for BMW money."}]}

Location - it's super close to the subway \n2. Washing machine - we chose this place because we were on the long trip and knew we’d have to do laundry. The washer works fine, however there were no instructions and so we had to look it up ourselves online. Most airbnbs we've been in had some sort of booklet or binder that has basic info about the apt but there was none here \n3. Building staff is super friendly and accommodating \n\nCONS\n1. Unresponsive - Ben was consistently pretty unresponsive/took a while to respond from our initial request of his airbnb through our entire stay. Communication was poor at best. While he sent us directions to his apt, there were no instructions on how we were supposed to check in until a few hours before . We were also passed off to two different people to contact for check in\n2. Dirty apt - the apartment was not very clean, surfaces had not been wiped down including kitchen and bathroom. The shower curtain had extensive mold as well as the caulking around the tub. There were hairs in the tub and toilet had a coat of dust on the tank - it basically wasn't cleaned before we arrived. All the bowls, plates, and cups were pretty dirty and there's also only one set of cutlery. \n3. Feels like you’re invading someone’s personal space — this is definitely a personal apartment and it feels like it. When we arrived we noticed personal items throughout the apartment that were not stored away. There were clothes in the dresser, a roll of toilet paper on the desk, a box of condoms in the bedside table, a robe hanging in the bedroom, a used towel hanging on the bathroom door, and worst of all — a razor, an electric tooth brush and toothpaste inside the shower. These are hygienically personal items. We understand that Airbnb includes sharing people’s homes, but this felt like an invasion of privacy. It felt like Ben had to rush out the morning of our checkin and forgot to tidy all the way. \n4. Construction — there’s a construction site across the street - you can see it from the balcony. During the time of our visit, there was consistent loud drilling from the construction site starting around 9am, so relaxing in the apartment during the morning was not an option. Wish the construction would have been noted before booking.\n5. One set of towels for 9 night stay — and they smelled like mildew\n\nWith some work, this could be an awesome rental. It's in a nice building, has a great view, and super convenient to public transportation."}]}

We found a place rather small and inconvinient for long term stays and a bit outdated. There was not enough kitchen utencils, basic dishes, glasses, no cooking pots, no dining plates (we bought our own), no electrical catle, no clothing’s hangers. A place needs a better management. However, aparment owner was nice and bought a coffee mashine after we requested. Also Mehmet arranged us once a week apartment cleaning.\nThere were a lots of noise and cigarette smoke coming from neighbors apartments. \nThe location is convinient and close to everything you may need in European side of Istanbul."},{"_id":"405052733","date":{"$date":"2019-01-26T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"27631138","reviewer_id":"38891586","reviewer_name":"Sa","comments":"Mehmet's place was perfect for a week trip in Istanbul.
