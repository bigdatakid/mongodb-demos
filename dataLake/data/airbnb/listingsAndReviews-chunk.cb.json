The flat is located in a strategic point where you can easily access any (touristic) part of the city even by walking, and the price is reasonable (cheap, really). Karla and her family are very kind and willing to help you with everything you may need. You can have access to a well equipped kitchen, and everything in the place is clean. As there were several people in the flat when I stood, it seemed a little like a hostel, but for me it was not a disadvantage but the opposite: we had nice talks and we made friends.

And the host didn't mention this is a mixed dormitory (mixed gender) in their homepage. I was pretty freak out the first night finding there was a man besides me. I wonder is it a normal practice of not stating clearly in Europe countries, but we have totally different policy in listing in Asia. I was thinking to move the second day but find another Asian gal just check in, and she leave on the same day as me, so then I stay for the rest days. The only thing I like is the location. It is convenient. So if you are not care about the unpleasant feeling of sharing room with the opposite gender and rudely treated by the host. You can then consider.

Moreover the location is not the best and you need to take metro to get to the major attractions. I booked another Airbnb in Barcelona for a little more (10 euros per night) and had a room to myself. This place had a rank smell, was dusty and the kitchen and bathrooms had mould. There are in fact three rooms with bunk beds, and they add you to any of the beds randomly. I was asked to give two euros the next day for the towel when this wasn't informed when given a towel. The person who asked for the two euros started to swear when I politely told him I didn't have the exact change. I only had 1 euro and thirty cents, which he took, with an attitude after he stalked off swearing, before I checked out. The only good thing was that I could check in at 1am, like any other hostel.

Loved it. We went to celebrate retirements, birthdays, relax and enjoy each others company and this complex provided us such an ideal opportunity to do so compared to the often crowded hotel resorts. This C1 villa has absolutely everything you need including heaps of beach gear in garage. We didn't want to spend $'s eating out each night and the really well appointed kitchen and BBQ allowed us to cook our own meals when we wished.  C1 is 10 metres from one of the the complexes 2 pools. Queens Market Place over road and Kings up the road, golf clubs in walking distance and ample walking opportunities. The community is compact from the Waikaloa Villas at one end to the Hilton Resort at  the other. The WBV's provide a pass to the Hilton to use their pools- we used and just well worth having a look at this complex complete with its own monorail!! We had a rental to do some day touring and beach visits. While there is a food store at Queen's its expensive so a short drive (15 mins) to the larger store at Waikoloa Village well worth it. Eat out options average at Queens and the nearby Kings Market Places, but we found Sansei Seafood, Steak and Sushi Bar at Queens superb - but you need to book. Most bars have happy hour (50% on beers and house wines from 3-6). We found beach front Lava Lava Beach Club by far the best here for ambiance, drinks and food-try the pulled pork sliders! and the marvellous sunset too and turtles came ashore  for the night. Hapuna Beach the best but need to take own chairs and umbrellas (from the garage). We did an 11 hour day trip with tour company to other side of island to see the volcanoes - much of the flora and fauna shown we have in NZ  but the lava glow/aura we saw at night was stunning. Trip was expensive but included a lunch and seated dinner - value for money ?? but we went to see the volcanoes and weren't disappointed.  Discount available if you want to sit through a Hilton presentation (no thanks).\nWe've been fortunate to travel worldly. In terms of relaxation this was the best. Two weeks without rain and 29-32 deg temps - heaven!   We're already planning a return in 2018! Just leave us a 10 day window please!"},{"_id":"212171514","date":{"$date":"2017-11-16T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8543198","reviewer_id":"112750315","reviewer_name":"Carol And Shawn","comments":"This place was as described and was a fantastic place to call home for a week.

Wake up in our cute apartment and take a beach-walk, on over a mile of quiet, practically deserted, white sand beaches lined with groves of coconut palms.  Then enjoy our pool or relax in your own Jacuzzi. Aloha and welcome to our listing. We have to warn you, our condo is unique. As you see in the photo's, there are few places where you can step out onto your living room lanai and run towards a near-deserted beach.  This is a place where you relax and relish the peace of the waves softly lapping on the shore while you watch the whales and a phenomenal sunset. Our beach is part of Maui's turtle sanctuary; many of our guests have encounters, swimming or on a beach walk with Aikane, the quintessential Hawaiian green turtle.  Take a dip in the pool or enjoy a scented bath in your own private Jacuzzi.  Share a drink and have some pupu's; (small kine snack), and enjoy the 180 degree sunset every night from the comfort of your own lanai.

We immediately felt ready to begin our vacation after hours of travel. We didn't stay at the condo much and mostly enjoyed the island. The location was perfect as a starting point to explore the island. We did visit after 5 tropical storms had hit in the previous 3 months so it was a little humid but no worries, the living room A/C was there to our rescue. Good tip: leave it on when your away to keep the condo cool otherwise it doesn't cool down the place when it's really hot. We slept on the pull outs (since the A/C is there) and plus who can beat the ocean sounds and view outside the living room?! We would gladly stay here again and we both think it was a steal!

We enjoyed breakfast at the beach every morning, just brought our towels and sat down in the sand. What a way to start the day! The condo is really home away from home, it has everything you need - and more! Alice is so warm and welcoming and made our stay extra special with fruit from her garden, chilled champagne and Hawaiian chocolates. The place is not smack in the middle of the most luxurious resorts and golf courts which we really appreciated. Instead, visiting the local restaurants meant dining amongst both tourists and locals and getting a bit closer to \"the real\" Maui. The beach just in front of the house is beautiful and we loved swimming there and reading under the palm trees. It was also easy access to the rest of the island, like Road to Hana which we did one day. What a journey! Do it if you have the time, we really recommend it. The pool was closed during our stay due to retiling but we didn't miss it for a second.

Our flight was delayed getting into Maui and most the restaurants were closed but Alice went out and provided us some groceries and snacks for a late dinner on top of the spread she already had laid out. That touch meant the world to us.\n\nThe condo was cozy and met our needs perfectly. ‘Right on the beach’ is right... we were just steps away from an amazing Hawaiian beach that felt almost private with little foot traffic. The surf was a little rocky but the water was crystal clear and situated nicely for a beautiful sunset.\n\nThis place was located centrally to anything you would need. We were within walking distance to the Times supermarket and the Azeka shopping center which has a lot of great restaurants and just minutes down the road was the Kalama Village which also had a lot of shops and eateries.\n\nOur stay was amazing and we will definitely use this place again if/when we return to Maui. \n\nMahalo \u0026 aloha!"},{"_id":"285834394","date":{"$date":"2018-07-04T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8556777","reviewer_id":"106089549","reviewer_name":"Kevin","comments":"A wonderful location that is right on the beach.

The beach, which is literally a few feet away from the condo, is in a secluded stretch of the Kihei coast and provides the luxury of avoiding crowds at other Kihei beaches.     There are spectacular views of the sunset that can be experienced from the beach or while relaxing on the lanai (back patio). Alice was very professional and responsive.

If I go back to Maui, I am definitely staying there. It is central and easy to get to other towns as well. Kihei is great if you prefer a relaxing beach atmosphere. You can also walk to restaurants, coffee shops, and a supermarket! Surfing is more on the north shore. Thank you again Alice! We LOVED staying at your place! Til next time!"}]}

Princeville is a great place to find condos like the Ocean Bluff Retreat, but as it is structurally very residential, we did miss being able to walk out directly onto a beach. It only took a day or so to get over that though, as there are so many stunning beaches just a short drive away.\r\n\r\nJeff and Shana truly care about their guests. The only issue we ran into was that one grill area did not work and one was out of gas, but there were directions on who to call to have it addressed. \r\n\r\nOur favorite part of the condo was the Lanai.

This place was perfect for us located in Princeville, close to Hanalei and the Napali coast hiking. \nThe views from the bedroom are absolutely as advertised - we woke up to the sound of waves every morning. The bathrooms and kitchen have obviously been recently re-modeled and the kitchen is well stocked with pots, pans, etc for cooking. The grounds are beautiful and quiet, and the pool is a great bonus!\nOur interactions with Jeff and Shana were limited, but they were very nice and even mailed something we forgot after we left.

The location worked great for the activities we had planned for the week. I def recommend having a car rental if staying in the north shore. One thing to note: the place does not have AC but during our May travel -temperatures weren’t hot at night. There are fans in every room so that helped. I also appreciated that the place came with a good amount of towels. I would def stay here again.

Much more spacious than we envisioned. Check-in was great and Shana was very responsive to our communications. Great location near lots of places that tourists would want to go. Magnificent views throughout, and a roaring ocean to lull you to sleep every night. The hosts provided some great information about the local area.\n\nOur only gripe -- and it is a small one even though the paragraph is long -- was that we thought the cleaning fee was excessive (about 13% of the cost of the rental) considering we were still asked to put all the dishes in the dishwasher and run it, gather together all the trash and take it outside, and clean out the refrigerator before we left. Happy to do those things, but we collectively felt like we shouldn't have to pay a cleaning staff $135 when we are doing all those things for them. \n\nAs far as the place and the hosts go, however, completely top shelf.

The neighborhood is close to foodland and good number of restaurants which is very convenient.\n\nMost activities like sailing tours , zip lines and choices of helicopter tours are at Lihue which is about a 45 minute drive which is a gorgeous drive.

Woolworth is just opposite of the road, lots of cafe and restaurants just downstairs, which the place is located on a quite street. I'm very glad I didn't choose another place which looks also close and similar but is on a noise street.  Tiger's place is spacious, clean, modern and well organized. There are some flight noises in the morning but I didn't even notice. The most comfortable bed I have ever had when traveling overseas, of course my own bed at home is the best. :)\nTiger is a friendly funny man, he helped a lot while I'm staying at this beautiful.

From the patio, you can walk over to the pool entrance maybe 50 feet away which we did several times.  The rooms are nice and the extra room has two twin beds which were perfect for our kids.  A/C is cool, kitchen has all you need to cook, there is a walk in shower, ceiling fans, and full cable TV.  The door is keyless with a code which is handy for multiple users coming at different times.  The garage unit had two bikes and several boogey boards and a couple sets of snorkle stuff which we used. The Queens shops are across the street and easy to walk to...Starbucks is maybe 400 feet away as the bird flies. We were impressed with everything, including the well maintained grounds of the gated condo community.

Overall, it was an amazing stay. The unit comes stocked with everything one needs for the beach and we enjoyed all of the amenities the condo had to offer. Our little one is 11 months old and the condo was equipped with two high chairs, a travel crib and many books for kids, which helped out a lot. This is definitely a baby friendly rental. Our only qualm with the unit was that the thermostat was hard set to go only as low as 74°, so at night the unit felt a little muggy, making it hard for our baby to sleep. But the condo fans helped to circulate the AC air as the night went on and we were vigilant to keep all the doors closed to keep the unit cool. We have stayed in different units in the Villas that don't have this thermostat restriction, so moving forward, it would be nice to make that clear to guests in advance in case they prefer to keep the condo cooler at night. However, having said all that, we absolutely enjoyed our stay and would definitely rent this condo again and rent with Resortica again.

We were happy to find this place was clean, clean, clean!  \n\nWe like to cook too, so we were glad that there was enough basics in oil and spices to not worry about those.  Did I mention we like things clean?  One way to tell is to see how clean the dishes and utensils are.  No problem there!  Clean kitchen with up to date utensils and appliances.  A big selling point was having a private grill on our patio.  Clean, there too and everything was in top working order.  The dual gas tanks were ready to go and there were sufficient grill tools so we could get the job done.  \n\nWasn't sure about the ground level at first.  We usually like a balcony.  However, once there, we found it relaxing to have access to the backyard and shortcut path to the pool.  \n\nThe garage was stocked with his/hers set of bicycles, a bunch of boogie boards and other ocean equipment that makes a vacation in Hawaii, near the beach a pleasure.  \n\nAll in all, it was a great unit.

The available amenities including outdoor bbq and comfortable outdoor sitting area are all well maintained or nearly new. The ocean is not visible from this condo but the surrounding grounds are lovely.\nMy one complaint is that upon our departure we received a very upsetting message from the host company Resortica that our condo was left a mess and that they may need to charge additional cleaning charges!!  They later apologized and explained that their phone may have been auto-correcting our condo unit for another one. The message said that they were very disappointed at the state of our condo upon departure, that all linens had been soiled and used, that we didn’t follow check out instructions, that our group included 10!!! people.  After spending most of the evening and all of the morning cleaning I was quite affronted. We washed, folded and put away all the linens ( with the exception of one load going in the washer), washed all the dishes except for a few in the dishwasher washing, took out the garbage and recycled the recyclables, shut off all fans and closed all blinds and locked the doors and windows and left the air conditioning at 74 as requested. We swept the floors and wiped out the fridge and reset the door code to the required setting. As for the number of us using the condo  there were three of us the first night, four the second night and four the third night. I invited Resortica to personally go and check out our unit to ensure that this was a mistake. I was assured that they would investigate and get back to me. This was a week and a half ago and I have yet to hear from them. This ruined the last day of my vacation and has left us feeling very uncertain about this host company. My recommendations to renters would be to make sure and take photos upon departure!!!"},{"_id":"412910746","date":{"$date":"2019-02-16T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8581508","reviewer_id":"130160001","reviewer_name":"Thomas","comments":"Super Apartment nahe am Pool.

It was clean, Greg was a great, accommodating host (although he suffered a serious accident while I was there and thus was quite limited in his activities. That will be temporary and did not impact the great experiences I enjoyed there.). He recommended the Waipio Cookhouse nearby for meals, and that was a terrific bonus. Good, locally sourced simple foods and wonderful staff. But you have ample cooking facilities at the hostel if you prefer, and coqui frogs to serenade you in the evening. If you want a natural, peaceful, inexpensive place to see local Hawaii, including Waipio and nearby valleys of true magnificence, this is an unbeatable choice.

There was so much dust in our room above and behind the blinds, in the closets, the lamps well everywhere and there was mold on the walls in the shower. These may not be issues to some but I coughed all night so that my niece finally went to sleep in the car. Greg issued us a $20 refund for the cleaning fee, I stated our objections and not wanting to bash them as people only the condition of our room which was hardly fair since we then had to find another room for the night and pay again.

The rooms are comfortable and tidy and the outdoor kitchen is fully equipped. We did quite a bit of cooking and eating in. There were a ton of tangerines to pick and eat while we stayed. The place is cozy but a little quirky- it is in the basement of an old plantation house (the window in our room looked out at ground level.) If there is a full house, you may need to wait to use the toilet if someone is showering. There is a nice outdoor shower.

He was very welcoming and had even picked up a few extra things for the kitchen especially for my arrival.  The room is big with lots of shelving and closet space.  The apartment is located close to a subway stop on the B/D line and one on the 4 line.  My only cautions for potential renters are 1) the heating system in the room is loud, so if you are a light sleeper this may disturb you 2) I found I had to choose between a hot shower or one with good pressure – I wasn’t able to achieve both, but that could have just been me, 3) at the time of my visit Douglas had not setup any internet yet and so you either need to rely on a data plan from your phone or do without.  Douglas also has to work throughout most of the day, so if you want to arrive or leave earlier in the day, you need to coordinate with him beforehand.

Very nice friendly and concerned about my needs . If you have any problems, please talk to him he will settle and leave you as comfortable as possible .\r\nThe room is great place for you to store your things . It has Wi-Fi internet and TV in the room . Furthermore the room has heating and in my case it was not necessary to sleep with blanket. He let me use the kitchen and its appliances ( microwave, fridge , cutlery , cups, plates , etc. ) . The bathroom is very clean and ideal for cold days NYC hot water. He gave me the keys to be able to enter the apartment and thus could freely visit NYC .\r\nWe had great conversations about life in the U.S. . The neighborhood is very safe and quiet great to sleep at night after a long day visiting Manhattan . The apartment is right next to the train station metro D.\r\n\r\nA tip for when you are staying with Douglas . It comes out very early to work and this also sleep early so do not make noise when back street at night ok ? Douglas is very cool and have all the respect for their guests .\r\n\r\nCertainly am staying with Douglas next visit to NYC .\r\n\r\nDouglas é um ótimo anfitrião! Muito simpático agradável e preocupado com minhas necessidades. Se você tiver algum problema ou dúvida fale com ele que ele irá resolver e deixar você o mais confortável possível. \r\nO quarto é grande com lugar para você guardar suas coisas. Ele tem internet Wi-fi  e TV no quarto. Além disto o quarto possui aquecimento e no meu caso não foi necessário dormir com cobertor. Ele me deixou usar a cozinha e seus utensílios (microondas, geladeira,  talheres, copos, pratos e etc). O banheiro é limpo e com muita água quente ideal para os dias frios de NYC.  Ele me deu as chaves para poder entrar no apartamento e com isto pude visitar livremente NYC.\r\nTivemos ótimas conversas acerca da vida nos EUA. O Bairro é muito seguro e silencioso ótimo para dormir a noite depois de um longo dia de visita a Manhattan. O apartamento esta bem próximo a estação de metro do trem D. \r\n\r\nUma dica para você quando estiver hospedado com Douglas. Ele sai muito cedo para trabalhar e por isto também dorme cedo então não faça barulho quando voltar da rua a noite ok?

The room is very spacious and clean. Radiators provided plenty of heat. The neighborhood is a different experience but it is a very friendly neighborhood and I always felt safe. His place is a short walk to the subway station with B and D line, taking about 30 mins to get downtown. It took about 1.5 hours to get to JFK (B/D - E - airtrain) but the train transfers were relatively painless with minimal walking and stairs. The convenience was good especially since I was traveling with large bags. Also, there were elevators up to the apartment so again, no hoisting luggage up and down flights of steps. I would definitely stay here again."},{"_id":"9205233","date":{"$date":"2013-12-13T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"858695","reviewer_id":"658000","reviewer_name":"Pasquale","comments":"I found \"my home\" in New York, a large room clean, with a large TV wifi internet,with a small breakfast included and  just 1 block from metro station stop,and in 20 minutes  you get to the 59th, and the \"plus\" of this choice is Douglas. a good person.

It was cozy and roomy for a new york apartment. It is close to a couple of convenience stores and a short walk to the metro. I stayed here for an interview nearby and a short vacation while I was here. I am a poor college student so I didn't want to spend money on a hotel room if I was only going to sleep in it. I spent most of the day out in NYC so this place really was perfect and very inexpensive. There is a heater and you can have full access to the kitchen and bathroom. Douglas also leaves food our for you for the morning as he starts his days early. I didn't run into him much as I am on a college wake/sleep cycle.\r\n\r\nThe photos do not do the room justice at all. There are two closets and a lot of shelf and hanging space all around the room. He also provides hangers for you to use. I didn't know this and brought my own to hang my interview clothes, but he does offer a lot of things that a hotel does. There is an iron and ironing board, a hairdryer, ample outlets, shelves, hangers, free wi-fi, a TV, and a full-sized mirror. I am sure I am leaving things out but it was really much better than I expected, especially for the price."},{"_id":"9398239","date":{"$date":"2013-12-26T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"858695","reviewer_id":"7949405","reviewer_name":"Jan","comments":"I had a great time at Douglas place!

His place is very clean and the building is very quiet.  If you've never been to NYC, don't be surprised by the trash in the neighborhood (It's not like Douglas can clean up the Bronx by himself).  I would advise staying on Grand Concourse on your walks home; there are just more people around and it was more comfortable than taking the back roads (**girl's perspective).  We came in around 1230-1AM often and never had any issues.  Do try to stay quiet since Douglas works early; he is very quiet in the mornings so it's only fair to do the same for him.  We actually only saw him when we picked up the keys and were able to communicate through AirBnB after that.  :)"},{"_id":"15938123","date":{"$date":"2014-07-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"858695","reviewer_id":"4552227","reviewer_name":"Megan","comments":"Thanks Douglas for a really great stay!

I had trouble locating the key, but that kind of thing happens.  Douglas was kind enough to come and meet me and even help with my heavy bag.\r\n  He bought rolls for my use in the morning.   The room was fine.  It was large by NY standards, but oh so comfortable.  The pillows and mattress felt better than mine at home. I had complete privacy because I only saw Douglas a couple of times when I needed to convey or receive information. It might not be detailed clean, but it was absolutely passable for the price.  The linens were fresh and adequately available.  There is a nice TV that comes with the room.  It requires a little manipulation of the antennae, but I was able to receive adequate channels and some news.\r\n The subway is about 2 blocks away.  You can catch the D train and go all the way downtown without a transfer.  You can catch the D train and go to 125th street for transfer to the M60 bus to Laguardia.  If you are new to NY and going to be there for a few days, I recommend the 7 day unlimited pass.  Feel free to get lost and see all you can see without worry of exact change or taking the wrong train.  Plan 30 minutes to get into Manhattan from  Douglas's stop.\r\n  I felt safe in the neighborhood and I visited several of the little markets for coffee and bagles.  There is also a restaurant down the hill called Caridad.  I had a bountiful meal there for $7.99 and it was also very good.  Their fresh orange juice was extreme.\r\nI was so glad to have stayed with Douglas.  It allowed me to take full advantage of the city, knowing I had a safe place to return at night and I didn't spend big $$$ for a room that was only used for sleeping and bathing.\r\nAfter I left, I realized that I had left my phone in the bedroom and couldn't get back in.  I think Douglas works 12 hours per day.  I called him that night from home in FL.  He generously offered to expedite shipping it to me at no cost.  I hope there is no rule saying you can't tip a host, because he deserves it.\r\n"},{"_id":"29701754","date":{"$date":"2015-04-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"858695","reviewer_id":"23629872","reviewer_name":"Michael","comments":"This is my second stay at Douglas place and again it was very nice, just like others are saying.

Douglas was very nice, pleasant and communicative. Grand concourse is \"TOP 11-20 NYC must see\", and there is no better way to experience it than staying at Douglas apt. The walk from D line 170st subway stop (NW exit on 171st) is very very short, less than 2 minutes. And I believe that this walk is also safer than most of the Brooklyn as the house is right on the Grand concourse, which is one of those parts of NYC that never sleeps :) This was my best out of 7 different AirBnB experiences in NYC when it comes for value for money, but it had 3 minor downsides compared to other options to stay which I did not mind, but may be worthwhile sharing: 1. it was pretty cold in the room when cold weather came on Jan 4 (I slept well after I put my hoody on, and used my winter jacked as the second blanket), 2. there is mould (black fungus) in the bath which is no problem at all when it comes to hygiene, but mostly a visual problem which some girls and women may however find very disturbing, 3. the choice of take away food and grocery stores is very limited, and surprisingly Bronx is almost as expensive as mid Mahattan in this regards. But for wise travellers who buy the take away food in Brooklyn and eat it in the Sunset park (the best view of Manhattan), and end up their days in NYC on the Times sq., this will be a very pleasant experience especially if travelling before late night hours, as the D train is super fast from Times sq. to Bronx as long as it is on the express track (up to cca. 11pm I guess). I always dreant of staying right on the Grand Concourse, and am very thankful to Douglas for this listing, for being such a pleasant hist and so communicative before my arrival, and for opportunity to finally experience a lot of Bronx - even though I always prefer a different place to stay for a new experience as a solo traveller, when I first come with 1-3 friends Douglases apt. will be the first option whose availability I will check."},{"_id":"60301179","date":{"$date":"2016-01-21T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"858695","reviewer_id":"49739606","reviewer_name":"Maheshkumar","comments":"Great host.

The picture depicted is exactly what you will get. You'll find a bed, night stand, an a.c unit, flat screen tv and a set of shelves on the wall to place whatever you like or to simply air dry something. The place is nice tidy with a bathroom full of bottled shampoos and soaps if you forgot to bring. The price for what you get is unbeatable. I will have to discuss with my friend about possibly a little decor added to the room which I feel would warm it up a bit and add some color.

Pretty good price for an apartment that's not too far off! It is particularly close to the 170th st D train station, just a mere 2 blocks away. There is a large pharmacy, a Subway sandwich store and several other delis/eateries nearby.\n\nThis part of the Bronx is very safe. I returned home around midnight with no issues. Lots of families in the area and kids playing out late at 11pm which are good indications of general safety. \n\nGood things about host and amenities:\nDouglas works long hours so he's rarely home during the weekdays. Nevertheless, he is very responsive to requests, and very generous and friendly as a person. Breakfast foods and bottled water are stocked every morning so you don't have to go out for breakfast. You are also free to use the fridge and cook your own food. \n\nThe room is very spacious (there's actually space for 2 queen sized beds and then some) and comes with air conditioning and cable TV which was something nice to come home to. Pillows and bedsheets are freshly washed and comfortable. \n\nThings to take note of:\nThe apartment is clean enough for its unbeatable price, but it is not entirely dust/dirt free. Most people don't mind it, I'm just highlighting this for individuals, who like me, have sensitive skin, to come prepared. \n\nNo washing machine for laundry, although this issue is easily solved by just heading to the nearby laundromats on 170th st.\n"},{"_id":"85847504","date":{"$date":"2016-07-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"858695","reviewer_id":"61686117","reviewer_name":"Damian","comments":"Douglas is a very nice and humble host.

Douglas says he will give information when the booking is made, I had to wait until last minute because he was just not answering me. One night he said two sentences, and then nothing. I feared I would be in NY without a place to sleep and it was terrible. Airbnb stepped in to help, giving him an hour to come back to me otherwise they would find another option. He didnt provide usefull information about the transport, would have been good to know that line B only works weekdays and line D skips stations and don't always go all the way to his neighborhood. It is a bit more then 30 min to the main attractions in Manhattan, took me more the an hour in rush hour. I wouldnt consider this place safe, as I was a white women solo and I can tell you I got some people shouting at me at night (around 10). He didnt mention his building has itps adress on one street, but the adress on another, and it was hard to find. I don't know what kind of hygiene standards people have, but I wouldnt have put food in is fridge, it was really dirty. The bathroom was terrible, dirty (walls, doors, bath...) mold everywhere, silverfish and even killed a cockroach next to the toilet one night, while another one passed by my soap in the shower to get behind a ceramic tile the other night. The only thing I was sure about was that there wouldnt be bug bites, since he left the mattress sealed in the plastic bag. You actually sleep on plastic covered with a sheet. The 2 nights I woke up soaked wet because of that. Douglas didn't take more then a minute to talk to me, is was not friendly and stayed in his room all the time except to eat breakfast. I didnt feel good or welcome at his place, I am glad there was a lock on the door room. The only 2 good things about this was that he provided cold bottles of water and air condition. Otherwise, this is a weekend to forget. I suggest you don't go there, actually, rooms like that are ruining AirBnB's reputation and should not even be advertised on this website.

This is an apartment in a building constructed when apartments were meant to be GRAND - housed (as it is) on the GRAND Concourse.  In its time this was intended to be the West Side's answer to East Side luxury.  You will still find remnants of that glory today.  In Douglas' apartment you have exquisite hardwood floors, largess in space, panelled walls - in that olde Manhattan fashion and truly stunning parquet in the kitchen.  More than that you will find one of the most genuine and charming hosts going.  This apartment is also well located - being close to the super fast (when it runs of course) D Train which happily dashes from 125th Street to 59th Street.  This was my second visit ... and I am definitely determined to add more.  That is, I think, the most sincere way I know of saying that this flat - and its master - come highly recommended - certainly by me.

I never met Marie, which was kind of strange since she lives in this apartment.  I stayed there for 3 nights. Every night I wondered where she would sleep since there's only one bedroom and one bed. Maybe the sofa in the living room is a sofa bed where she sleeps when there's a guest?   That kind of puzzled me. Marie always answered my e-mails and was kind enough to let me bring my stuff before the check in time. She gave me instructions on how to open the apartment but I didn't get clear instructions on how to enter the building. I was very lucky that another airbnb couple staying in another apartment opened the door for me, otherwise I wouldn't have been able to open the building door. The apartment itself is tiny but comfortable. The bed is very comfortable and theres a fan for hot nights. Marie only provided a towel and nothing else. I was lucky I had a bar of soap. There's a tv that can't be watched by guests because there's no control. I wasn't sure if I could use the fridge and kitchen so I ate out. There's plenty of cheap restaurants around, mostly mexican.  The neighborhood is quite rough and dirty. It didn't feel very safe especially at night. It's mostly a dominican-mexican neighborhood. The building is very old and shabby but the apartment is quite nice and cozy. Access to buses and metro station was great. Only two blocks to the metro.

Listen to the sound of the ocean , watch tropical birds in your yard and pick some fresh fruits. The views are stunning. Surfing is the best in the world during the winter. Swimming, diving, snorkeling, hiking spots, amazing sunset views are just some of the gifts of staying on the North Shore.  Can you walk to the beaches?  Yes, you easily could, but I recommend taking your rental car. There is so much to see around the neighborhood, so many restaurants, food trucks, parks, stores, the beach with the turtles - parking is free and easy.  The shoreline with a large Foodland Supermarket and a Coffee Bean Store, Pupukea Beach and Sharks Cove is less than a mile. Haleiwa Town or the Turtle Bay Hotel about 7 miles, Waimea Park, 1 1/2 miles, Sunset Beach 2-3  miles  ( depending on where you go)  The beach where you can swim with the turtles is 3 miles away.

People are friendly and the Aloha spirit governs here.  Feel free to jog around the neighborhood. Don't worry about some barking dogs, you will love the homes around here and the views - it's really beautiful. Yes, we have mosquitos. The Northshore and Hawaii, in general  is beautiful and green, it means we have rain, but mostly in the evening or during the night. It's important to keep the front door and bug screens closed to keep pest including mice out of the home. Twice a month my house is treated for pest, but you will always see Geckos and once in a while a cock roach. They are part of the inventory in any home and are harmless.  Trash pick up is Wednesday morning and I would appreciate you putting the gray trash can out to the street on Tuesday night.  Our water is clean and safe to drink, but I also provide ice cold drinking water to my guests, and you can find an additional container in the garage.","transit":"A rental car is the best solution to stay at this house.

It was a big house on the hills in Pupkea, only 1 mile from Foodland, but driving is much safer than walking down the narrow, whindy road to get to kamehameha hwy (main road to beaches). The house is made of all wood which was beautiful and unique. It has a lot of character and the location offers an amazing view of waimea sunset area. The house is a lil older (but clean and tidy) so expect a real hawaiian style vacation.  The ac units in each room didnt do much for us but most of the fans worked out well. Some of the lights didnt work so if these things matter to you i think they would accomodate with a simple request for bulbs ahead of time. We were okay with the lights we had but upstairs was a little dim at times. The hosto was great responding to everything right away. He even treated us to dinner since he had to get the washer replaced, which was super prompt. Usually id prefer to stay closer to the beach but this location was so close to everything that it was a nice change of pace, and nice to be so close to northshore beaches (waimea, sunset, rockys) as opposed to being in waialua,where i stay usually. Overallourstay  was great! Clean house, lots of towels, great view, new washer AND dryer!!

It is about a mile up the hill from the beach so you have gorgeous views of the ocean and sunsets with the wrap around deck. Geckos all over the place, which my kids loved. At the bottom of the hill was a grocery store which was great. The house is in the country side of the island with winding roads so it was a bit hard to find when we got in after dark but Juergen was super helpful in finding it and answered right away when I called. His place reminds me of a little surfer's bungalow. Totally gives a great island vibe.

We met Sharon and Amy upon arrival. Immediately we knew that Sharon ( the owner) is a warm and friendly person. Throughout the time we spent there…. every contact was an absolute pleasure.\r\nThe cottage is set as a separate building but only 10 feet from the main house and didn’t feel private. It is a single room with a walled toilet and shower. We expected more of a kitchen and food prep area than what is there. The very small refrigerator does neither make ice nor keep it frozen and it was necessary to ask for ice from the main house daily. If you want to prepare some of your own meals, the cottage is not supportive of that. Washing dishes and cooking items must be done in the bathroom sink without counterspace while standing on the wet shower floor. I think that our biggest issue was that the whole property wasn’t very well maintained and there was much junk laying around that should have found a trash bin long ago.

It's a wonderful spot to watch the sunrise and the boats coming into the harbor. The room is very cozy and comfortable, just a great little studio, and the actual structure that houses the studio is detached from their home so it offers quite a bit of privacy. However, Sharon always made herself available for a great chat! We found Sharon and Mark to be extremely friendly and accommodating, even letting us use their drier (since this area of the Big Island gets quite a bit of rain, we got soaked on our visit to Akaka falls, so the drier was thoroughly appreciated) and we really enjoyed their company.

True, there are more clouds, but for people who enjoy an active vacation it is perfect. Relatively close to for example volcano np, mauna kea, hill and some gorgeous beaches. These are not the white sand beaches found on the Kona side, but the green surroundings and steep cliffs around make them very special. Impressive nature and not touristic at all. After also have seen the Kona side, the Hilo side is much more relaxing. It is under 2 hours drive to south kohala, and the way up there through the coast north of Hilo is very pretty, including waipio.

We never got to meet Sharon and Mark, but instead was taken care of very well by Amy. We arrived a lot later than originally planned yet Amy was very accommodating wth our late night arrival. Check in was very smooth and the studio itself was amazing. It had everything we needed, from basically a full functioning kitchen to an attached bathroom. Amy was always available by text for anything we needed and was there to say aloha in the mornings. My boyfriend and I very much enjoyed the private, quiet studio and patio that sat on top of a hill and had stunning views of the countryside, beach, and stars at night. I was blown away by the very affordable price and could say it was definitely worth every penny and more. I have nothing bad to say except that I wish we could have stayed even longer.

It was secluded and absolutely peaceful.  Their place was spotless, the furnishings were comfy and maintained.  They left fruit, coffee, a \"starter\" breakfast and snacks, just great.  I had my breakfasts and several meals on the back veranda rather than eating in town.  The kitchen was basic:  hot plate, fridge, microwave; wash the dishes in the bathroom sink. What they advertised, so it wasn't a surprise.  \n\nThe caretaker, Amy, was very nice and friendly, and checked in daily to make sure everything was good.\n\nThe location was secluded, but with that, it is a peaceful place.

This was a tranquil place with beautiful sunrises. The host, Amy, has helpful in getting us checked in. The studio is located right off of a main house, but you have your own space, privacy, and patio. The whole space was comfortable. You are provided with a small \"kitchen\" with utensils and cookware. There is no sink to clean, but we were told to just leave any used dishes for later cleaning. There is no AC, but most properties on the island don't have them; not really necessary. The way the studio is situated provided enough cool breeze, along with the fan. It is hard to find off the main road, so follow their instructions carefully or use UPS.

This violates almost all rental car agreements in our experience. It is difficult to find in the dark. This was not included in the description when we booked the airbnb. We strongly suggested it be included (with photos) in the description on the airbnb website. \n\nBEWARE PRIVACY: We didn't feel like we had any privacy. The studio is right beside the main house. When the windows are open, you can hear the main house and they can hear you and because of the warm temperatures, the windows need to stay open in the studio. A car arrived at 5:30am and parked right in front of our studio. The headlights lit up the interior through the curtains of the studio. Based on our experience, expect the host to disrupt a part of your stay here. \n\nVIEWS: The majority of the views facing the ocean from the studio unit are blocked by bushes and greenery. If you look out at a certain angle you can see a small part of the ocean between the bush and the main house. The exception to this is the view from the private patio - that is a lovely ocean view. Unfortunately, it was too wet to use this private patio for most of our stay. \n\nSUMMARY: The studio itself is clean and spacious. The bed is comfortable. The shower pressure is perfect. The kitchenette is perfect for making coffee and heating up breakfast in the morning. The host is very nice and attentive if you have a question (or can't find the place). However, we will not stay here again. We wanted more privacy, accessibility that did not violate the rental car agreement, and quality sleep on our vacation than this airbnb listing offered."},{"_id":"199750944","date":{"$date":"2017-10-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8597222","reviewer_id":"137741506","reviewer_name":"Sarah","comments":"What a great view!

The property manager, Amy, was so friendly and hospitable. I highly recommend. It is about a 20 minute drive to Hilo, but coming from San Diego, I'm used to needing to drive everywhere. Although, the TV was small, the ability to watch Netflix was a nice perk for the day we spent in relaxing. The only complaint I would have is that the humidity was tough to get used to without an A/C unit. The description clearly says that it is not included, so this the apartment matched my expectation; it was just the weather that was worse than I was anticipating.  There was 2 fans that were extremely helpful and allowed us to fall asleep at night with them pointed at us.

She was very helpful and the day I flew back I had a full massage on site \"al fresco\" with the view of the Hilo Bay. Good stay for 3 nights for 2 people. You do need a car to get around.

The space includes amenities one would expect to have in certain hotel rooms including wardrobe/mirror, mini fridge, plus a table in one corner. Bonus options included onsite massage therapist, and a loaner vehicle. Definitely need a car to reach this location, with Hilo Town about a 10-minute drive away, but any car is a must have if adventuring throughout Big Island, anyway.

The eastern view of the ocean is spectacular. We sat on the little patio with coffee and pineapple, and watched the sunrise. The WiFi worked well. And everything was comfortable and well maintained. You won't be disappointed. A few tips though. It is off road a bit, so be prepared to drive down a long, rocky, bumpy country road to get there. It has a few kitchen essentials, but I'd say it's not a place where you're going to do a lot of cooking.

We used (Hidden by Airbnb) maps and it took us right to the place. As stated in other reviews, the road to the house can be a little bumpy, but a slow speed will get you there, no problem. And OMG the sunrises. We got up each morning and drank coffee on the private patio overlooking the ocean. It was the best way to start each day. It’s only a few minutes from Hilo and has the benefit of feeling off the main drag and away from any tourist mayhem. \n\n*The studio* \nIt has everything that we needed: bathroom (no tub), queen bed, coffeemaker, microwave, mini fridge, and a table to eat at. It even had a TV that we didn’t use because we were in Hawaii. The host provided some nice extras that we didn’t expect: coffee \u0026 filters, silverware, plateware \u0026 glassware. There was also a hotplate available. But again, the best part of the studio is the patio that has a table and 2 chairs. \n\n*The host*\nSharon was very welcoming, meeting us in the driveway upon arrival, and leaving us to get situated as soon as she’d given us the rundown. She offered advice on where to go and what to do based on our preferences. The nicest part was that even though she and Mark live in the house next to the studio, you wouldn’t necessarily know it. Everything was very quiet and peaceful and we never felt like we were under foot or too close.\n\nWe would highly recommend the sunrise studio. I think it’s ideal for a couple, but could easily sleep a couple more on the sofa bed (for a family). Sharon and Mark were great, and if we ever come back to the big island, we’d love to stay here again."},{"_id":"410176252","date":{"$date":"2019-02-09T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8597222","reviewer_id":"236998954","reviewer_name":"Anne-Marie","comments":"Great spot and very welcoming hosts.

We were provided with everything we needed.\nThe house is not air conditioned, which is fine most of the year but it happened to be very hot the week we stayed due to a tropical storm.

Its walking distance to the beach. Tiffany was fast in answering any of our questions. I would really recommend this house, specially if your trying to stay away from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki. Kailua has amazing beaches!\r\n\r\nCons:  I understand its a cultural and respectful thing to remove your shoes before entering the house, but our only hiking shoes got stolen. I would suggest to remove them outside and place them inside next to the door. There is a broom available in the house to sweep when needed. \r\nThe only mirror in the house is a small one in the one bathroom in the house. I traveled with my two sisters. One mirror with 3 girls was a little difficult. Other than that, its a great place to stay!! Thank you Tiffany!

We were 3 adults and one baby and could not comfortably fit in the dwelling . The listing says it’s a cottage when in fact it’s a converted garage and is extremely small. When the sofa bed was out it left only a couple of feet to manoeuvre between the bed and kitchen and was very unsafe for the crawling baby . It was uncomfortable for 3 adults in the tiny bathroom as well, no room for toiletries by the sink. The bedrooms were extremely small and the foam mattresses very uncomfortable to sleep on .

We were not looking for anything fancy, just a clean, convenient,  more affordable option than a resort. This fit the bill!\n\nThe kitchen and main room are clean, with updated appliances. Great shower! The second bedroom had plenty of room for a travel crib, and we loved having laundry on site, as well as grass in the backyard. \n\nTiffany was an incredibly responsive host leading up to and during our stay.\n\nWe enjoyed sunrises at Kalama Beach a couple blocks away, and each evening we’d walk/stroll to dinner in Kailua. As she recommended, Kailua Beach Park and Lanakai beaches were great for beach days with a toddler. Whole Foods, core power yoga studio, and target within walking distance were also a plus!"},{"_id":"409800859","date":{"$date":"2019-02-08T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8598424","reviewer_id":"111658510","reviewer_name":"Christine","comments":"Cute cottage and great location.

Every night we slept keeping the lanai door open, so we can hear the waives crashing in the near distance. Highly recommended! Just keep the slider net closed, so no uninvited small tropical guests get inside :-)\n\nThere is a nice shopping plaza next door with everything you may need for your vacation: snorkel rental shop, fish restaurant, souvenir shops, attraction bookings etc.\n\nAlso, twice a week a farmers market takes place there offering huge selection of local organic non-GMO fruits,  vegetables, honey etc. Free luau dancers are having their show as well twice a week.  \n\nAll I can say is that we got great value for our money and if we have another chance to visit Kauai we'll look this place first.

Try the hotel next door, or sleeping giant grill for tacos. The lanai and ocean view were what made this place really special for us. Central location on the island makes an equidistant drive to go north or south. Worked well for us. The only small thing, is that the pool is not heated, and in March it was a bit cold for us to use. Place was clean, check in was easy, we didn’t actually talk to anyone. Just make sure you go to the front desk of the hotel and get a parking pass.

The east side of Kauai was a perfect place to stay as you have access to both the North and South beach with just a short drive away. Plenty of great food options nearby including Sleeping Giant Grill which is literally less than 100 feet away from the unit. Coconut Market was conveniently a short walk away as well.\n\nCons:\n\nWe had a 6 night stay but were only provided 4 towels for two people and 3 small toilet paper rolls. If staying more than 4 nights, be prepared to pay $35 plus tip for a mid-stay cleaning / towel and linen change. Unfortunately, the service did not include toilet paper, so I had to go buy some from the store. No one wants to go buy toilet paper on their vacation.

The best part is the patio where you can look out over the courtyard, pool and ocean beyond. \n\nYou’re also in a great spot for any adventures.

I'm not sure if the beach would be swimmable, but it was very picturesque. There was a booklet taking about the local sites and food options, which we found very helpful.\nThe bed was comfortable (firm mattress), and despite other reviews plenty of linens (extra sheets and towels) were provided. There was a hair drier in our unit. \nThe kitchen area was small but sufficient for our purposes, and the AC worked great, though the instructions in the unit stressed not turning the temperature lower than 70, so those used to sleeping in 68 degrees or below may take issue.\nOne note- the instructions in the unit were much more extensive than the house manual on Air BnB, and sometimes they contradicted each other. For example, many instructions referred to a lockbox for the key, when we just had to enter a code into the door. Also some check-out instructions said to take trash out to bins at the base of the stairs, and some said to just lock up and leave. As there were no trash bins at the base of the stairs... I'm sure this is because Hula Now has multiple units/properties, but it might be good to clarify that.\nOverall we had a great experience in a perfect central location for exploring Kauai!

It’s about halfway driving distance to the south to Koloa and to the north Hanalei- which makes you able to have a flexible schedule if the weather changes, like it did for us.  Also it’s only like 15 minutes to the airport! Because of its location on the coast, it was often sunny right around Kapa’a even if it wasn’t elsewhere so we enjoyed the beach and the pool very much! The bed was super comfy and we loved that the lanai overlooks the ocean.  It was nice to have a mini fridge for snacks and drinks but the location is also walking distance to a couple of restaurants including Lava Lava and Hukilau, and for our morning coffee Imua coffee hit the spot! Parking was easy although there are certainly less spots available after 8 pm but we were able to find a spot by driving around the lot for a little while.

The store is immaculate.\n\nWe never used the coffee pot because there is a very nice coffee shop next door. A two minute walk from the lobby. Opens at 6:00 AM.\n\nBed very nice (firm). Great shower head. Kitchen adequately stocked for two. Very nice juicer, which we did not use. Last day discoverd a safe in closet.

We also stocked up on breakfast food and some dinner foods for grilling at the grills near the pool area at the local supermarket, which you can walk to in the Coconut Marketplace. We found we had zero issue with the amount of towels provided, and there were more than enough garbage bags for us to keep the room clean ourselves. Overall, this was a great “jumping off” point for our vacation in Kaua’i. You could spend a whole week relaxing at the resort and its nearby beaches within walking distance and have a successful vacation. Or, you could do as we did and spend several days traveling north to Hanalei, south to Poipu, and west to Waimea - nothing is more than 1 hour drive.

This was exactly what we were looking for on this vacation. The apartment is literally 3 houses down from the entrance to Lanikai beach, so about a 2 minute walk. Mary was a great host and made us feel right at home. We knew that if anything came up,  she would be there to help us, but since nothing came up,  we mostly kept to ourselves. I wanted a relaxing vacation away and thus place hit the spot. I would definitely recommend Lanikai studios to anyone and will definitely stay again if I am every back in Lanikai!"},{"_id":"290108671","date":{"$date":"2018-07-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8627986","reviewer_id":"102663856","reviewer_name":"Sarah","comments":"As the other comment stated, if you are looking for a quiet place near the beach, this is it! 30 second walk to the beach can’t be beat.

Unfortunately, for the price and location of the Airbnb, we were expecting nicer. While the unit itself worked for our stay, it felt run down, sort of a motel feel to it. Also, the shower didn’t drain until about 10 minutes after showering and the flush of the toilet was loud enough to hear outside. Bed was comfortable and the hot plate worked well enough for us to cook everyday, and again, being right across from the beach was amazing. Our host was friendly and easily reachable for questions. The property also has beach toys, chairs and umbrellas, which is awesome! But like I said, for the price and location, we were expecting a much nicer place. Overall though, would stay here again. \n\nMahalo!"},{"_id":"343512577","date":{"$date":"2018-10-31T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8627986","reviewer_id":"48839832","reviewer_name":"Sayama","comments":"It is a very clean room.\nThe interior was cute.\nIt is close to the beach, easy to go shopping, convenient location.\nThe host is very kind."},{"_id":"403878779","date":{"$date":"2019-01-21T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8627986","reviewer_id":"41075671","reviewer_name":"Heather","comments":"Great location with the beach access just steps from the front gate.

For you guests arriving late in the evening, the Malt House next door is great for dinner and/or drinks. The French Gormand, also next door, is great for breakfast croissants and coffee.

For a first time NYC visitor, the transportation options were very convenient since the metro stations were a block away with access to nearly all of the Uptown/Downtown metro lines and a walking distance to Battery Park and others. I could not ask for better location other than 5 Star Downtown.\n\nSecondly, the apartment was very comfortable and accommodated all six of us to stay. The spacious apartment provided us amble space to kick back and relax after eventful days and not to mention, having the elevator and the kitchen were bonuses. Jennifer’s prompt services made our staying more comfortable by accommodating any unexpected requests by us.\n\nFor those who want to take advantage of the chauffeur services to the apartment, I strongly recommend using Dan’s service as he is very knowledgeable and engaging person. He provided us a tour of NYC with a 10-15-minute stop at Brooklyn side so I can view NYC at its whole for the first time. It was well spent because I didn’t feel any rush or urgent pressure at all as it made my trip very relaxing and “spoiled”!\n"},{"_id":"166118484","date":{"$date":"2017-07-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8628309","reviewer_id":"34315342","reviewer_name":"Laura","comments":"Jennifers place is a great location.

Over half of what I wanted to see was very close by. Federal Hall is a stones throw and a must see. George Washington was sworn in there as our First President. They have a Statue and a plaque of him praying at Valley Forge. Across the street is the New York Stock Exchange and you have Wall Street right there and The Federal Reserve. Another block and you have the famous charging bull. It’s also very close to the New York departure for the Statue of Liberty and I drove across the Brooklyn Bridge twice just to say I did it.\n\nWe arrived a little late and met Jennifer’s husband instead of her and we are very glad that we did. I parked in an area that would have gotten me a ticket or towed. I didn’t even see the sign and didn’t know what to look for. Her husband not only gave me some great advice about the area but he actually came out with me and helped get me parked in a great place for the night and explained the parking signs and what to look for. \n\nOnce we got back he helped unlock the bathroom door that my 4yr Old shut and locked. We realized once in that we forgot to grab some bottled water but he had some of that as well. Super great people. I would highly recommend staying here.\n\nThe apartment was very quiet. If not for seeing people in the elevator I wouldn’t know anyone else lived there. We slept soundly. They are close to everything with plenty of new food places to try and traditional. I took two Uber’s while there as I didn’t want to drive in that traffic but I would recommend the subway. It’s a little intimidating at first with 4 kids that have never been to a city bigger than Nashville but it’s  the best way to get around.\n\nThe apartment was clean, nice, super comfortable bed and had everything we needed. There were six of us and it was perfect for our stay."},{"_id":"282206311","date":{"$date":"2018-06-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8628309","reviewer_id":"138734608","reviewer_name":"Adrian","comments":"Just as described!

To be fair, New York was mostly overcast with occasional showers during our stay. However, in the photos, the curtains were open to allow in sunshine but it wasn't really obvious that the view outside the window was another apartment block in very close proximity so we felt like we were looking into someone else's apartment and vice versa which is why we kept the curtains closed, hence the dimness. Also, the building, elevator, hallways, apartment itself feels old and dated. However, it was in a GREAT location, two blocks from Wall Street and the Freedom Tower, a block or two from the subway station, a short walk to the pier and harbor, tons of eateries, coffee shops around. The neighborhood has a lively, vibrant feel and is always bustling with action. It felt really safe to walk around as there are always tons of people. Second bedroom has two twin beds which worked really well for our two kids, but no windows so the floor fan that's provided helped a lot at night."},{"_id":"296792172","date":{"$date":"2018-07-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8628309","reviewer_id":"121962350","reviewer_name":"Janine","comments":"Jennifer was an amazing host making sure we were quickly checked in and the apartment prepared for us at very short notice.

The only issue you need to consider is parking. It's very difficult to find a parking space in the street, so we used the parking APP to reserve a nearby garage. And the garage charged more for oversize cars (like SUV, VAN, etc.). And if you want to do laundry, you can use the third floor laundry room and Jennifer offers the laundry card. You just need to add money to use the laundry card. The issue is you need to add at least $12 to the laundry card which is much more for one washing and drying.  And during our stay,  the building's hot water system was broken, so we had no hot water in the first day. Jennifer helped us to contact the building's management and followed all the status of the repairing. Overall, we had a great stay in Jennifer's house in NY.

The pictures of the house accurately showed the current state of the inside and backyard of the home-beautiful!  Unfortunately,  the cleanliness of the house was not as good as I had anticipated, considering the fee I paid for cleaning expenses.  I had to wash the inside of the fridge, the kitchen counters and bathroom, and the upstairs floors.  The main level floor was dirty as well, but we just kept our shoes on during our stay.  We were disapointed there was no air conditioning and only 2 windows had screens to let in cool air at night.  The patio doors did not have screen doors either. We recommend installing a ceiling fan above the bed, however there were 2 small fans that came with the unit that we utilized. The neighbourhood itself was sketchy-we watched homeless people change their clothes and a druggie shoot up in the parkette situated across from the house.  In spite of the negatives, the house is completely modern and beautiful inside-you would never know the house was originally built in the 1800s!  Richard used wood from the old house for the new renovations that add wonderful charm to the updated kitchen and living room.  The kitchen was a dream to cook and eat in and it had everything that we needed (except a microwave, but not crucial).  The bathroom was huge and we especially loved the large luxurious spa shower.  The area was surprisingly very quiet so we had no troubles sleeping.  Perhaps the characters in the park were one-offs.   You would be hard pressed to find such a spacious, modern and beautiful home with a covered deck and lovely backyard in the middle of the city."},{"_id":"83877820","date":{"$date":"2016-07-04T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8634239","reviewer_id":"1308180","reviewer_name":"Rachael","comments":"Our host was fantastic!

It made me consider moving to Montréal.\n\nThe backyard is a real treat after a long day traipsing around the city (or a long drive from NYC) and there's a small park across from the front door. Ample, but competitive, parking on the streets. The shower has three heads and a detachment. Don't say I didn't warn you.\n\nThe bed was so comfortable that we overslept and were late getting back to New York. My only regret was not bringing my laundry. I had a lot of fun playing with the kitchen lights, too."},{"_id":"195736148","date":{"$date":"2017-09-20T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8634239","reviewer_id":"65317910","reviewer_name":"Renan","comments":"Superbe logement ! très bien situé, proche du métro et au calme !!!"},{"_id":"197478668","date":{"$date":"2017-09-25T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8634239","reviewer_id":"29637271","reviewer_name":"Ben","comments":"This place was great!"},{"_id":"198231031","date":{"$date":"2017-09-28T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8634239","reviewer_id":"105942060","reviewer_name":"Laurie","comments":"Appartement très bien situé.

The property is on a quiet street with no regular vehicular traffic.\nWe couldn't enjoy the backyard, but believe it would have been wonderful during the summer.

With seven people in our group we had enough room. We also had family over for dinner and enjoyed our time on the roof garden once the sun started to go down. The apartment is a traditional Spanish design and we appreciated the main bedrooms being away from the living area so people who were up late did not disturb those who wanted to sleep. The main bedrooms are on the street end of the apartment and you should be aware the streets are loud at night. Barcelona is a vibrant city where people stay out late. This apartment is very close to many of the tourist sites and the metro, the neighborhood felt safe and there are many small cafes and restaurants nearby.

The other beds besides the Master not that comfortable.  Sparse with blankets. The apt is adequate but if you are looking for nice accommodations for vacation,  I am sure you can do better.  As advised by Fernando and others, noisy in twin room and master, the 3rd bedroom by kitchen you can hear the elevator go up and down.  The master when you shut the shutter doors is quite enough.  If you need a big place and not that picky, this would work for you.  There is some kind of home day care on one of the apts that face the courtyard and you can hear lots of kidsin the am.

I would definitely recommend."},{"_id":"108962641","date":{"$date":"2016-10-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"865367","reviewer_id":"89834279","reviewer_name":"Ariel","comments":"Very nice flat!

The check-in was well managed, having received lots of information prior to arrival. The property manager was present when we checked in around 4PM, and she gave us some extra guidance. There were a few minor repairs that needed to happen in the unit, but the property manager was aware of this and considering it is someone's home, we didn't feel it was much of an issue.

Check out the Waikoloa village market for decent Island prices on groceries. There are two separate pool and hot tub areas right next to the condo for your use. Be sure to open the sliding doors and front door, turn on the fans, and let the air flow through the condo for an amazingly refreshing Island air breeze. This condo honestly has everything you could want from beach chairs and a wet bar to a fully functional kitchen and washer and dryer. I would recommend staying here to everyone visiting the island. Please make sure to respect the property and all that this amazing location has to offer so that Paul and Christine continue to make their condo available for rent.

It's even better than the pictures !\nAt Waikoloa Village, Hua Bay and Lava Lava Club are must-dos.   Kids also liked petroglyps at King's Trail !

You probably could hear a pin drop at night.  Loved all the special extras that the owner provides:  Lots of towels including beach towels, boogie boards, beach chairs, beach umbrella, cooler, pool noodles, even ice packs in freezer, and washer and dryer in unit, etc. etc.  We were a bit concerned that having no air in the unit would be an issue, but there are ceiling fans everywhere, plus standing fans to keep you cool at night and there was usually a lovely breeze later in the evening to cool things down. The owner replies quickly if questions come up and we found everything how it was described.

Da hätten wir uns im Vorfeld über ein paar Informationen gefreut. Der Pool war gut und wir hatten diesen oft für uns alleine.

The house is nice and located in a good spot--5 minutes' walk to the beach.\r\n\r\nHowever, I must point out that the original description is not accurate. It says \"AC\" in the title and clearly states that the house has AC. However, upon our arrival in the late evening, we discovered that there was not a single AC unit in the APT. We contacted Carol, and were told the AC was broken and removed. Her initial suggestion is to ask us to find another place and she will refund us, which seems to me ridiculous as it's impossible to find a comparable home at 7:30pm in West Maui with a comparable price! To provide some context, we made the reservation 6 months ago just in the hope of securing a good place with a reasonable price.\r\n\r\nEnd of story is that Carol brought two portable ACs on the second day and we have no choice but to suck it up. To be fair, it was not too hot in Maui in Feb, and we are generally satisfied with this home, but inaccurate description?

However, we had a really negative experience dealing with Carol. When we arrived, I called her to let her know about some issues (bathroom shower wasn't draining, no propane for gas, AC not working), and she said she'd send her handyman over soon. That afternoon, I got back to the house and nothing had been done. Eventually, when he did show up, Carol had only told him about the propane so he wasn't able to fix any of the other issues and had to come back later. Roto Rooter ended up having to come for the bathroom because the handyman couldn't fix it and despite us telling Carol in writing and over the phone that we weren't comfortable with the plumber entering the house without us or her handyman present, we arrived home to find him there alone and he told us Carol had given him the access code. She was incredibly rude about the entire thing, and we had to spend multiple days of our vacation dealing with these issues. Ultimately, there are plenty of other houses in the area that are just as big/nice at the same price so I can't recommend this one because of the negative experience with Carol and her management style.

I will note that a lot of other places we visited on the island had this same issue. Generally, while the furniture was nice and the whole thing was cute and had an island decor, it really does need to be renovated I think. The air conditioner worked very well, but the AC unit condenser was right outside the house and was very loud in the 2nd and 3rd bedrooms. \nA note about the 3rd bedroom: the twin beds are small and not for adults. Also - the door in the 3rd bedroom was not really a door, more like hinged partition that you find leading to a den or a closet - basically it only provided for people not to see inside, but you could hear everything going on in the common spaces which made it very difficult to sleep if other people were awake. This bedroom is really only for children, it is not fit for adults. I wish that the owner would have mentioned this when I contacted her and clearly stated that we had 6 adults and no children. \nAdditionally - the WiFi was very poor - nearly unusable. No HDTV. This was especially apparent to us as we had just stayed in a AirBnB in Honolulu the week before that had clearly updated WiFi and Electronics, so it was a bit annoying.\n"},{"_id":"126423504","date":{"$date":"2017-01-11T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"867745","reviewer_id":"83670051","reviewer_name":"Rachel","comments":" We loved our stay at Carol's place.

I'll list the things that I found good and not so good below.\n\nPros:\nWe were able to check in early which was nice.\n10 minutes walking to the beach.\nPlenty of parking.\nWe were cooking a lot and had everything we needed to cook with right in the house.\nAir conditioner keeps the place nice and cool.\nPhone reception at the location is great(Verizon).\nLots of beach gear like chairs and floating boards etc.\nEverything like the beds and towels felt clean.\n\nCons:\nLike other reviewers have mentioned, the house itself feels a little old and not really cared for.\nDuring our stay we had the sink leak and the kettle break. Also the fridge was leaking a bit. Not a huge deal just annoying.\nThere are three rooms total with beds, 2 bedrooms with king beds each and 1 room converted into a bedroom with two twin beds. The king beds are comfortable but the twin beds are pretty old and squeaky.\nThe wifi is just plain bad. It's slow and for about 3 nights out of 7 it just didn't work. \nThe house has crickets living in it and they like to make noise at night which freaked out my wife at first. I killed a couple on our stay there but there are definitely more.\nAnd the last thing is the air conditioner, it's REALLY loud. It hangs right outside one of the bedrooms so when it's on it's practically impossible to sleep in there. It's fine during the night since you don't really need it on but if you like to take naps during the day you can't use that bedroom.\n\nIn general everything was fine but if the owner would just take care of the house a bit it would be a much better place to stay."},{"_id":"152883133","date":{"$date":"2017-05-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"867745","reviewer_id":"25203872","reviewer_name":"Soledad","comments":"Hermosa casa, buena ubicación, cercana a la playa.

The living area is old style vaulted which is lovely. The place is dated, but it feels island-y so that really isn't a problem. Coming from ultra modern San Francisco it is quite a change, but a welcome one. The walk to beach is about 10 minutes and the local beach is Kahekili beach, which is great for snorkeling (though there are better). The beach is much better than Kaanapali (which is frankly awful) and is a great place to be based. It was never crowded. As for the house: There were ample boogie boards (no waves so we didn't use them). There were ample masks and snorkels for adults and kids (we didn't use because we brought our own) and a pair of fins (we had our own). Plenty of towels as well. There was a small beach umbrella, which does the trick for two, but we brought our own sand anchor and would recommend either your own umbrella with anchor or purchasing one. There were also a couple of coolers (which we used) and various other items. We did bring our own water shoes and those are essential for kids and less confident swimmers. The house had a fully stocked kitchen including many basic ingredients (no olive oil, but we left our extra bottle). There was also trash bags and dishwasher soap, as well as laundry pods (we never did laundry). Bathrooms has soap and hand soap as well. Shopping was really limited to groceries, which was incredibly useful. Carol had a bottle of wine for us when we arrived. Parking was easy and right next door. We used the car to go to farther beaches and the Safeway (about 10 minutes away). The lanai was very pleasant with a good gas BBQ. All switches were thoroughly explained with sticky labels (actually quite a good idea). The TV and entertainment area was lacking. No way to connect to the dated stereo system (bring your own UE speaker for hanging out). And the TV channels on DISH were not HD (funny how poor the picture quality was until HD). Also no premium channels and the only way to watch movies was a DVD player. So no movie nights here. A couple of issues. The proximity to the highway was just loud enough to be noticeable but not enough to disturb sleep. The windows are old style glass slats which don't do a good job of noise damping or insulation, but do a good job of airing the house out during the night. There was AC but we don't like AC and didn't need it during out trip. Daytime high inside was 84 and overnight that dropped to 80. AC usually causes someone to get an earache so this is a blessing. The sprinkler woke us up a couple of times. Carol was an excellent host.

The pictures really don’t do it justice! The kitchen was well-appointed and had everything we needed to cook many meals, and there was plenty of counter space. The dining area was very nice and had plenty of room as well. The living area had the most wondeful, cozy sofas. The layout of the main living area was great - since there were several seating areas, the teenagers could each have their own space while still being together with the adults. I also appreciated the little touches like the ceiling fans and stereo already being on when we arrived, that was very welcoming. The decor is somewhat modern with a vintage Hawaiian feel - the perfect combination. Bedrooms and bathrooms were nicely sized and in good shape.  We were very thankful for the use of Carol’s quality beach chairs and umbrella, as well as the washer/dryer. The location is great - the beach at the end of the street was great for snorkeling and bodysurfing, and less crowded than Ka’anapali despite being right next to it. We didn’t have any trouble parking at the beach, and we also walked to it once. I can only hope it won’t be too many years before I get to visit Maui and stay in this beautiful cottage again!"},{"_id":"311263046","date":{"$date":"2018-08-20T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"867745","reviewer_id":"56624826","reviewer_name":"Anthony","comments":"This home had some 5 stars and 2 Stars. It lacked attention to detail. The photos don’t allow for actual smell of the home.  It may have been a the type of cleaner that was used on the flooring, but it was pungent. This home had AC which was a plus, unfortunately this may be the only upside.  It did come with a fully stocked kitchen (ie, utensils, cookware, cups , etc)  and washer and dryer, but all that is expected when renting a home for a long period of time.  This home lacked functionality. The bedroom linens were dated, flat and smelly. The TV system had to be carefully tested to see what worked.  And the home wasn’t fully sealed to keep outside critters where they belong. However, I would rather see a lizard than a spider or other kind of bug.

(Grandma/Grandpa, Mom/Dad and 3 kids (ages 21, 19 and 15) \n\nCommunicating with Carol was exceptional - she always got back to me within 30 mins. Check-in was super easy. The location of the home, was perfect, right in Kaanapali and a very close and easy drive to Lahaina and Whalers village shopping and dining.\nThe home is nice-loved the wooden beams and how roomy everything was. Close parking lot, right by the home. \nThe private Lanai was awesome, spend every morning enjoying the sunrise!!   \nIt has 2 lounger chairs and 4 chairs and table. It also comes with a BBQ.\nThe 3 bedrooms were great and roomy!! \n1 Master with en-suite bathroom for Gma/Gpa, 1 Queen Room for Mom/Dad and 1 room w 2 twins + additional bathroom. Youngest daughter slept on the couch in the living room, as there are muliple \"living areas and couches.  The living area and kitchen were nice and roomy - even had netflix and wi-fi, which the teens were very grateful for!  The property has a swimming pool just 3 doors down, which we never used, but it is nice and has a small outside kitchen and BBQ area.\nA quick 10 min walk to a beach, which was super easy and nice to do in the mornings\nWe loved that the home came with lots of extras!! Lots of Beach towels, 2+ beach chairs, 2 body boards, sand toys, 3-4 pool noodles, etc.  Rental place was super close, so we were able to rent additional chairs, snorkel equipment and additional body boards and surf boards (great prices).  Check out was super easy.\nWe loved Carols house and are looking forward to our next stay in Maui and at the home!!

The location was well situated in town and the home itself was very spacious, beautiful, and so comfortable.  There was enough space for us to all lounge around together, or go into other areas of the home as we needed.  The Lanai has a nice (distant) ocean view with lovely plants surrounding it and the birds love nearby the trees. There is a little bit of road noise while on the lanai, but it’s not so disturbing that you won’t use the space. We did every day! The beds and all other furniture are very comfortable.  We loved having the beach chairs and towels to use at the local beaches. My husband even enjoyed a round of golf on the adjoining golf course. Carol was prompt and responsive to all questions and wonderful to work with. We will certainly plan to come back to this location as soon as time allows!"}]}

It's a fairly quiet residential area formed by geometric grids, though it's true you'll see some tourists around, especially near the Sagrada Familia.

There is no Sunrise Unit of any kind. It is very  noisy as you will hear every movement from above where the host lives. Toilet noises from above, fridge noises, street noises ... it is like a nice cave with a comfortable bed. Trust me, you won’t be happy staying here . You want to experience Maui differently , with light , air and health . This place lacks of all of that. It is super humid, hot and despite being clean it doesn’t feel clean. I have reported this place as 1 it is completely inaccurate and 2 it is not a unit of any kind. You need windows to somewhere but the garage. The front door you see it’s on the side of the garage, there is no Sunrise of any kind, there is no privacy unless you close the curtains as people can see you if the walk the back alley where the entrance is . Look, the host is a nice lady who is trying hard to make this space work, unfortunately this should not be allow on Airbnb as it lacks the fundamentals of any house or unit.

My favorite travel destinations abroad are Greece, South and North America at the moment.   \r\nI am married and a very happy father of two children. I try to travel with my family as long as my son is on holiday and not goes to the school. We all are interested especially in good food, new places and nature. \r\nThis property you are viewing now is located very central in the historical Peninsula so called Sultanahmet and was my home for about 6 years. After I moved to another district I remodeled the house and have now 17 rooms with en-suite bathrooms to rent. Public areas like terrace, breakfast room and a lounge are also available for all my guests. Our location is just perfect in case of being so close to the major sights and security.

It's in the heart of the West Village and it is a typical New York studio that looks exactly the same way it does on the pictures. The window is not street facing and it's on the fourth floor, so the street noise was not a problem for me as it was pretty quiet at night. The host asks in the house rules section of the description to be quiet, so if that works for you, you'll have a good stay. I didn't have any problems with the internet once I connected to the Ethernet cable that the host uses to connect her computer to the router.

That being said, my check-in experience here was incredibly awkward because the host wanted my presence to be completely hidden from the rest of the building. This meant meeting up several blocks from the apartment for check-in, hiding around the corner while she waited to see if the neighbors would leave her stoop, being told not to make noise carrying my luggage up the stairs to the 4th floor, being asked not to leave the apartment if neighbors might be in the hallway, and being instructed to ignore the super if they came knocking at the door.\n\nI'm not picky when it comes to accommodations, especially when I need them on the cheap, so the fact that the unit itself is tiny and doesn't come equipped with toiletries doesn't matter so much for me. The host is a perfectly nice person, and this review isn't meant to be personal in any way. But it wasn't an especially pleasant or relaxing stay because of the uncomfortable check-in process and the expressed need for me to be invisible to the rest of the building.

It is exactly as described. The location is surely unbeatable. I think it's important to keep in mind a few things, concerning some of the previous comments. When booking an apartment in one of New York's pre-war buildings, one cannot have overly demanding expectations. All of these buildings are very old; the apartments may look dirty no matter how thoroughly one cleans them. That's because the construction is poor. In my opinion, and given the price, Marise's place is a great deal. Marise herself is a very nice and open person. I would definitely recommend the place to someone who's on a budget, wants to be in one of the best locations is NYC, and does not have extremely high expectations.

That said, I would not stay here again, for two main reasons. \n\n1) As a previous guest mentioned in a review, Marise made the check-in process a pain. She asked me to wait on a street corner for 10 minutes because her neighbors were in the hallway and she didn't want to be seen with a guest, and then she took the next 10-15 minutes packing up her belongings while I was in the apartment. I had been traveling all day and all I wanted was a shower and sleep, so this prolonged check-in process was inconvenient and uncomfortable.\n\n2) The apartment was technically clean but was so run-down and dingy that it felt dirty. I realize these are old NYC apartments and I don't expect highly-modern accommodations, but it was everything from the grime in the bathroom tiles to the chips on the walls to the stains on the wood floor. This isn't Marise's fault and it shouldn't deter guests who are willing to forgo some comfort and class for a cheaper alternative, but it didn't work for me. \n\nSmaller complaints: There wasn't a garbage can anywhere in the apartment so I had to store garbage in a plastic bag hanging from a kitchen cupboard; the A/C unit didn't effectively cool down the apartment; there was a strange smell in the entrance to the apartment; etc.\n\nI think Marise's place is a good deal for budget travelers who know what they're signing up for, but I wouldn't stay there again myself."},{"_id":"195506054","date":{"$date":"2017-09-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"875567","reviewer_id":"77835698","reviewer_name":"Legendre","comments":"Lovely stay at Marise flat !"},{"_id":"201532138","date":{"$date":"2017-10-08T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"875567","reviewer_id":"6916894","reviewer_name":"Michael","comments":"The studio itself reminded me of the similarly-sized, rent-controlled apartment I once had in Manhattan. Apartments like these are in older buildings which are often poorly maintained by landlords who are eager to \"nudge out\" long-time tenants and capitalize on higher rents for newer tenants. In this context, some cracked tiles, old appliances, and the like are to be expected. The lack of \"polish\" some reviewers mentioned is attributable to this. Blame the landlord, not the tenant! Nevertheless, I had a very pleasant stay.  The studio itself was comfortable. The location was terrific. And Marise herself was a communicative and kind host.

Marise takes this to a different level. On check in she arranged to meet away from the actual building. When at the building door Marise became highly agitated when she thought someone from her building may see us coming in which created a very strange atmosphere. This person she saw turned out to be a cleaner rather than a resident so we eventually headed upstairs to the apartment.\nOn leaving by pre arrangement Marise wanted to meet me to check out of the apartment which I was happy to do so at her request. On leaving the apartment Marise heard someone coming up the stairs and then physically grabbed me by my arm and pulled me in to the small hallway of her apartment closing the door to avoid them seeing us. I found this very aggressive. In my mind this is unacceptable behaviour for her to touch or grab me in any way and made me feel very uncomfortable.\nI would not recommend staying at this apartment for the reasons listed above."},{"_id":"321508090","date":{"$date":"2018-09-10T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"875567","reviewer_id":"10593389","reviewer_name":"Imelda","comments":"DIRTY,  SMALL\nI had to clean the bathtub before I used it. The bathroom, in general, wasn't clean. The mirrors were covered in filth. The bathroom sink didn't work and had a layer of dirt at the bottom. The fridge was very dirty inside and out and had a foul smell. The ceiling had water damage that is not shown in the photos. I will be asking for the cleaning fee back.\n\nThe photo used in the post is stretched out to make the place look twice as big as it actually is. The A/C unit barely worked (our host admitted when we got there that it didn't work as well as it used to) and stopped working altogether after being in the apt for 10min. The host said, \"That just happens\". Luckily my son was there to help me with my bags and figured out that the unit was, dangerously, plugged into too many extension cords. \n\nI met our host a block away from the apt and she said to \"I have to smuggle you into the building\". She waited at the entrance of the building and waved us up when the cost was clear. My son had to run up 4 flights of stairs with two heavy bags in order to not be seen. Apparently, her neighbors don't want her to rent out the place. None of this was in the description. She then informed me that I would have to listen at the door to make sure no one was in the hall before exiting. There were still dirty dished in the sink that she had to clean and the towels were still at the laundromat. She seemed unprepared for our visit.\n\n\nCan't complain about this.

What a sweet cottage with views of the bay and covered porch. We  ate Thai takeout ( Check them out on trip advisor.) on the covered porch. It is really clean and the communication was great. We slept with the windows open and enjoyed the tropical air. There is an air conditioner in the bedroom and you may want to consider using it- the neighbor has three dogs that start barking way before dawn. For coffee drinkers- bring your own supplies. I can't move in the morning without a cup and had to go to local store store for a styrofoam cup full everyday.

We had an amazing stay. Brook's property manager, Sarah emailed us directions and pictures of the front gate to the property prior to our arrival. This was immensely helpful to us as we arrived in Hana after dark. Upon arrival, we found the cottage to be clean and roomy. The king sized bed was very comfortable. We miss having a king size bed in our own condo and it was definitely nice to be able to spread out to sleep. The towels in the bathroom was amazingly soft and luxurious. It was a welcome surprise and made our stay seem super high end. In the kitchen, there's a helpful binder full of tips on house rules, area restaurants and things to do. We really enjoyed picking up local groceries and making our breakfast in the kitchen each morning. \n\nSome things to note: There's no shoes allowed inside the cottage. I felt that this helped us keep the house clean throughout our stay so I didn't mind. In the mornings, the dogs in the neighborhood bark loudly so make sure you get a good night's sleep and start your day early! We are normally not morning people but we found that our day time adventures tired us out enough to get us to bed early. It was also more important for us to get up earlier to have enough day light to explore all of Hana's natural beauty. \n\nOne major thing that bothered us was the wifi. The connection was pretty spotty. We were able to get the best connection in the living/dining room area which was surprising since the modem was located in the bedroom. It would have been nice to have a more stable connection as we had no cell signal in Hana. For reference, we have T-Mobile. (Pro Tip: download the Gypse Maui tour phone app before you start the Road to Hana. This provides location based audio tour for the drive and works without data. The entire Maui tour is $10. We got the Road to Hana only tour for $5 and bought the Maui tour after since we liked it so much.) ."},{"_id":"223132816","date":{"$date":"2017-12-31T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8764966","reviewer_id":"158762436","reviewer_name":"Nelson","comments":"Great place to stay in Hana.

The relaxation factor is high, and it was so nice to be able to cook in when traveling. There is a gas station and a general store, but it is wise to bring your provisions with you. The location is perfect for exploring the area at a more leisurely pace. We had a great experience, and would love to return. The cottage is in a quiet neighborhood, but there are some chickens and dogs who are early risers.

Full kitchen, except no dishwasher. (Not a problem)\n\nComfortable bed, nice sheets and towels. Other guests were quiet and respectful.\nNeighbors dogs did keep me awake both nights with constant barking, as they would get other neighbor dogs started. I would think the owners should bring them in the house...this is not the property owners fault, but was frustrating as I’m here for classes and studying, and it was troublesome for that.\n\nThe space itself was nice, clean and functional.

The house has a lot of sweet touches and ungraded items that other places didn’t have....Think newer air conditioner, soft towels, and an amazingly comfortable bed, and the landscaping and privacy is simply beautiful! I could have moved in.... we just loved our little Hana cottage!! Wish could have stayed an extra day. We thought 2 days would be enough, but we could have stayed twice that and more!

We spent 5 comfortable nights here, which was a long enough to leisurely explore the area such as Hamoa Beach, Kaihalulu Red Sand Beach, Waianapanapa State Park, and Pipiwai Trail; the AirBnB is within walking distance to Hana Bay Beach.

The house was beautifully decorated, down to the artwork on the walls.\n\nThe house was stocked with just about every imaginable amenity you could need, from towels to glassware to 2 clothes steamers. Every single drawer and cupboard is labeled, making it super easy to find things.\n\nEach of the bedrooms had excellent beds and were all well appointed. The master had one of the most incredible bathrooms ever. \n\nLocation-wise, it sits on a ranch with a view of the ocean just past Kamehameha Highway. Turtle Bay is a few minutes East, and Ted's Bakery, Shark's Cove and Foodland, Sunset Beach, etc. a short drive West. A few of our guests took short walks to the water each morning, and it is incredible peaceful to sit on the lanai or balcony and listen to the waves.\n\nWe had to call Captain Ken just once because one of the key fobs to the gate wasn't working - it was a dead battery - but he picked up the phone after the first ring and couldn't have been friendlier.\n\nStaying at this property made our wedding week even more memorable and I emphatically recommend staying here for any occasion you can justify.

I would recommend booking an extra day for departure to allow for more time if needed if your departure flight leaves at 9 or 10pm and you have little ones.\nThanks! Will definitely be back :)"},{"_id":"308132980","date":{"$date":"2018-08-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8778128","reviewer_id":"172177884","reviewer_name":"Jill","comments":"It was very clean, spacious and comfortable.

The location of the apartments is wonderful / just one block from Ipanema beach. We liked Ipanema beach much better than Copacabana, even though it was not far from Copa neither. Good restaurants and bars around. Busy place. We have enjoyed our holidays a lot. The apartment might be a bit small for 3 ppl, we managed well cause we were friends that know each other well.. So i would suggest the place for 2ppl maximum.. Anyhow we are all still in touch with Lili and Cadu, we became great friends. Thank you very much.

Luckily someone told us about airbnb.com so we decided to have a look for a nice apartment near both beaches with a kitchen and all the mod-cons.  We found exactly that! The apartment is on the 9th floor in a complex and only a few hundred yards from Ipanema beach, and a 5 minute walk from Copacabana. There is also a 24/7 supermarket opposite the apartment.  The kitchen is reasonable and clean, a nice big lounge with cable TV and a comfy little bedroom with cupboard space and A/C.  There is one queen size bed which is fine for 2-people sharing and a single bed with an extra pull-out for a 4th person.  However, i think the room is at max, best for 3 people (we are 3 big guys).  The best part is the hotel-standard en-suite bathroom and shower. very nice!  \r\nCadu and Lilian were extremely helpful and made our short stay really helpful, recommending all the best sites, prices and good times to visit.  They also came to change the linen and towels whilst we were out which was really nice.\r\nAt the time we stayed there was also another (very pleasant) girl living in her own room with her own bathroom so just keep that in mind in case you want big parties etc.\r\nWholeheartedly recommend this apartment, and will definitely be coming back the next time i visit Rio!\r\nThanks Lilian and Cadu!

She has provided me with all the information regarding the apartment, as well as with the comprehensive guide on how to get to the apartment from the airport. Lilian and Cadu have kindly checked me in despite on my late arrival. The welcome to Rio chocolate gift was such a sweet touch!\r\nThen, the apartment itself exceeded all my expectations - it was located very close to Ipanema beach (Posto 8, Aproador rock), as well as in 10 minutes from Copacabana beach. There are lots of different shops and restaurants in the area, bus stops and a metro station. The building was on a safe and quite street with 24/7 doorman. We could use living room and a private bedroom with en-suite bathroom, sharing the kitchen with a fridge, dishes, and a drinking water. Lilian was so nice to provide even the separate kitchen towel for us.\r\nThe bed was comfortable, aircon was working well, cable TV with various channels, and the room was overall very clean when I've arrived. Bed linens and towels provided to us were also of a good quality and condition. Apartment has everything you need to stay. \r\nAgain, I can't fully describe how I feel happy to find this place during the high season of Carnival for such a great rate, but most of all I was blessed to meet such nice and talented persons like Lilian and Cadu. \r\nI wish I could stay longer, and I hope I will come back to Rio again and again, meet Lilian and Cadu, and stay at this apartment =) Obrigada!!! xx"},{"_id":"11598913","date":{"$date":"2014-04-08T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"878307","reviewer_id":"13188229","reviewer_name":"Armand","comments":"très bon emplacement, appartement propre, ras."},{"_id":"14421733","date":{"$date":"2014-06-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"878307","reviewer_id":"9197423","reviewer_name":"Scott","comments":"A few friends and I stayed in Lilian and Cadu's apartment for the first week of the world cup.

The kitchen has everything you need, fridge, freezer, often, micro, ice cold water supply (in Brazil you shouldn't drink tap water) it is always good to have a water-filter installed, Cadu and Lilian had a special drinking water fountain. 2 TV set one at the bedroom and one at the main hall and most important for me a good internet connection (WIFI) that worked at every corner inside the flat. The building is quit, friendly people and a great staff - some of them don't know you at first so you have to say in Portuguese \"apartamento NOVE ZERO DOIS\" and show them the key, that's means flat 902 - next time I'm back in Rio for sure this will be my number one choice and I will recommend it to many friends and clients I meet - greetings to all from lovely Vienna  "},{"_id":"62502008","date":{"$date":"2016-02-15T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"878307","reviewer_id":"50833194","reviewer_name":"Andrés","comments":"Lilian fue muy preocupada y hospitalaria durante la recepción.

The apartment can easily fit three people -- two in the bedroom, and one on the futon.

Os espaços (quarto e sala) não são grandes, mas funcionaram muito bem para nós. Ficamos no apartamento em 4 pessoas e conseguimos nos acomodar bem.

Extremely responsive and patient in communications. I asked all sorts of dumb questions since sometimes the Portuguese to English translations don’t make sense. The place is very clean and hi-tech. The lights turn on by remote control. The WiFi was super fast. I love the electronic lock system — you never have to carry a key. The apartment is SUPER convenient AND safe (24h concierge). The apartment is smack in the middle of ipanema, 2-3 blocks way from the beach. It’s on a Main Street, so it’s next to everything you need — coffee at 7AM, supermarket a block away, restaurants etc.  \n\nOne minor thing to beware - LITTLE ANTS!! Paulo says they are common things in Brazil so nothing one can do. Do your dishes immediately (even if there’s no food on it anymore and it’s just used dishes) and take out food-related trash immediately. I left out an empty dish that held ham on the kitchen counter for a few hours and it drew ants nonetheless."},{"_id":"255777518","date":{"$date":"2018-04-21T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"880678","reviewer_id":"129600735","reviewer_name":"Renzo","comments":"Excelente ubicación y comodidad.

Fantastic location, spacious and clean apartment, roof deck was a nice bonus!  Other things we really enjoyed about their apt.:  room for all 3 of us to sit at dining table together to eat/talk...a rarity in NYC apartments.  The dual-entry bathroom made it easy for anyone to use toilet during the night, without disturbing sleepers in the adjoining room.  The kitchen has that quick-steam, plug-in teapot which was great.  The views are very NYC.  And that \"Ess-a-Bagel\" place a block away is fantastic!......every kind of bagel and cream cheese and sandwich you could imagine.  Two of us stayed two nights and there were three of us for one night...and we were plenty comfortable.  We would suggest some more \u0026 larger towels (just one hand towel and we didn't find washcloths anywhere) and more bedding.  There was only a fitted undersheet (on mattress) and then an ultra warm duvet/comforter on main bed.  The same on couch bed. Duvet was too warm of a cover for us, a regular cover sheet or lighter blanket as cover would've been more hotel-like/normal."},{"_id":"57453580","date":{"$date":"2015-12-26T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8806783","reviewer_id":"48531252","reviewer_name":"Lisa","comments":"Aquil and Laura were very welcoming and made our stay that much better.

With lush foliage, two pools (the salt water one is fantastic as it's on the water), BBQ area with grills, and a sandy area with lounge chairs and palm trees. It's hard to want to leave in the mornings. In fact, the morning we left we took a last dip in the salt pool and watched a pod of playful dolphins swim past...

The grounds were beautifully kept and the pools were not busy and very nice! The only time things got busy was around sunset, but we spent our last evening walking out a little path to a rocky area and enjoying it by ourselves. The location is right on the water and a short drive from everything.

We had an easy time getting around to some great restaurants and a nice beach. The pool at the complex was wonderful. We had an ocean view and could hear the crashing waves, but had the calmness of a pool. There was only two other people in the pool too, which was nice to not have it be loud or crowded. The apartment itself is well stocked with kitchen items, toiletries, towels, including beach towels and ocean gear to borrow (chairs, boogie boards, etc). There was a pack n play for our baby which was also great. The only problem was there’s not a great place to put the baby except in the bedroom with you. The other concern for us is there’s no carpeted area in the main living room, just tile, so for our 6 month old he couldn’t be left to crawl around and play by himself since falling over would’ve been quite painful! For older kids who are better at crawling and sitting it’d be fine though. The nicest thing was jeanna allowed us a late checkout so our baby could finish his nap which helped us have a better day all around. Overall it was a great place to stay, a little expensive for one night, but lovely and very relaxing."},{"_id":"275801241","date":{"$date":"2018-06-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8809414","reviewer_id":"15649608","reviewer_name":"Jenette","comments":"This location is very convenient and the waterfront waves were the highlight. We had quite a few lovely mornings and sunsets watching and listening to the waves crash against the rocky shore. The sandy beach lounge area is a really nice touch, as well as the salt water pool, because you get all the beauty vibes even not being in an ocean-front swimmable location. \nThe main drag of Kona is an easy 15m walk away, or you can hop on the trolley. We seemed to keep missing the trolley so we hitchhiked or walked to town most days. I recommend renting a car to enjoy the island, unless you are an ambitious hitchhiker (which is quite safe on the island). This unit comes with a parking pass which was really nice. \nThe day we arrived there was a notice on the unit that the electricity would be out from 7am-7pm the next day, so neither the unit electric amenities or the pools were open. We rearranged our plans to be gone that day, but as a very-much-not morning person, the immediate early wake up to be able to shower and whatnot right after a long day of travel was kind of a bummer. The host gave us a partial refund for this day after some back and forth. \nIf you are squeamish about bugs, be prepared to spot a cockroach or two. There was a huge dead one when we arrived and some smaller ones we got rid of. I think that because this is a ground level unit off the garden area, they sneak in the lanai door when left open. Wasn't a huge deal to us. \nThe premises are really lovely and well kept. Take a peek in the bush on the lanai and you'll spot a bird nest! there were two eggs there during our trip so the next guests may have some chicks to admire. \nThe neighbors and other guests are really kind as well. One couple feeds wild eels that live in the rocks. I'd never seen wild eels so that was a really neat thing to see. \nOverall a good trip, with just a couple minor hiccups!"},{"_id":"277615471","date":{"$date":"2018-06-16T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8809414","reviewer_id":"66346753","reviewer_name":"Tina","comments":"Jeanna’s place was great!

The top-floor apartment itself is well kitted-out and clean and very quiet. Maree and her husband, who live downstairs, are very welcoming and kind. There is a bus very close to the apartment which takes just under an hour to get into the centre. There is a convenience store down the road.\r\n\r\nOn the downside, the kitchen is quite small and any cooking is based around plug-in hobs and woks which means that cooking for two was a bit of a challenge, but not impossible by any means. The pool is a reasonable size (not for lengths but for dipping in) but unfortunately was unusable for much of our stay. This was a bit of a disappointment, but the sea is not far away!\r\n\r\nAll in all, this was a nice stay with lovely hosts and I would recommend it to others."},{"_id":"61194088","date":{"$date":"2016-02-01T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"884057","reviewer_id":"5541043","reviewer_name":"Leo","comments":"Very nice accommodation, great owner, location is also very good, close to the ocean.

The apartment was big enough to house 4 and comfortable. The small stairs to the third floor makes it a bit difficult to come up when traveling with heavy and clunky suitcases. Finding a supermarket or bakery nearby is hard and walking with kids to the center can be a bit far, but luckily we had a rental car. We never met Ana but we could always reach her online and we were met by a key holder to let us in.

Freezing and bleak are nearer the mark. It was an endurance task I never want to experience ever again! \nGranted we visited on NYE which is probably the one of coldest times in Porto, but I never thought I would be renting an apartment that had insufficient heating on Air B\u0026B ( this was our first time ) \n Myself and the other guests had to wear 4 layers of clothing at times. I didn't use the shower as it was so cold in the bathroom it would have been unbearable. There were 2 electric heaters that had little effect as the apartment is open plan with high ceilings and has stone floor. We had to be resourceful and turned the oven on and opened to door in the hope of some extra heating! Our plan was to cook dinner as the restaurants were very busy, but we really couldnt stay in the place to do so.\nWe called Ana on NYE and she said she would drop off an extra heater and blankets 'tomorrow'. We waited until midday the next day but nobody came. When we returned to the apartment in the evening \u0026 still no word on the heater etc. My husband put oven and the hob for extra heat and this must have tripped the electrics, so there we were freezing, sat in the dark in a hill in Porto...Happy 2017 ! We called Ana and her husband arrived some what 'put out' as he was just about to sit down to his evening meal and then had to come out into the cold and fix the electrics!! \nWe considered going to a hotel by the airport as we were leaving Porto at 7 the next morning but we just went to bed to try and get warm and we didn't want to spend anymore money.\nThe worst thing for us was not being able to get warm for the whole 2 days. It was cold outside, 4-10 degrees but it was the same in the apartment. \nI am writing this honest review in the hope Ana does rectify this serious issue when renting out her place in the winter months."},{"_id":"134469733","date":{"$date":"2017-02-27T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8844419","reviewer_id":"49170103","reviewer_name":"Audren","comments":"A good place, in a very calm neighborhood, but not far from the center of the city.

He is not a little dog but still felt very comfortable in the loft and spacious enough. It's was very convenient that the bed is upstairs and so your pup can't climb up to bother you at night. This was our choosing point for this apartment. The host was very helpful and responsive and left recommendations of where to go and what to do around. It was helpful. They have good and fast wifi (faster than we have at home so I was surprised haha) and the location is also quite good, about 10-15 mins walk from Porto Baixa , a lively region with bars and restaurants. The parking wasn't a problem, right in front of the house. \nRecommend for couples, families with pets too.

The neighborhood is quiet but if you like to venture out for drinks, it's only a few minutes walk away. \r\n\r\nI booked the room literally hours before landing and Liz answered all the questions I had. She have great direction and the house rules are basic. Be a grown up and have respect for other people's things. \r\n\r\nWe enjoyed having everything at reach! We went to Hana, upcountry twice and of course the beach everyday. There is ample parking and security actually is friendly and reliable. The office lady was inviting also! The neighbor even gave us perriers and a ton of limes! \r\n\r\nThe kitchen is fully stocked. We kept thinking this and that and we open a cabinet and it was already there! The water pressure in the shower was perfect and I loved having so much space in th room for our multiple luggages. \r\n\r\nDon't think twice about it. You'll be lucky to be able to stay here.

However, in general all residents were respectful of the quiet hours, but you can hear when people get up, walk around and go down the stairs.

Liz and Chuck provide all you will need including a box of fins and snorkels to try, 2 boogie boards, and 2 beach chairs."},{"_id":"217123218","date":{"$date":"2017-12-07T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8844994","reviewer_id":"544248","reviewer_name":"Bill","comments":"Chuck was able to stop by and say hello which was great.  He shared some insight on sharing his place and I wish I had his luck.  I'd have done the same and shared this incredible place with others.  Front door has combo-lock access plus extra key inside for easy continued access.  Very clean, fully equipped kitchen and no need to rent snorkel gear.  Everything works perfectly.  Great TV too.  Even an outdoor BBQ just out back sliding door.  We never neede the A/C but one is there if needed.  A very short walk to the sandy beach and shopping is also a short walk away.  Centrally located so our car wasn't needed unless we wanted to go far.  Easy and safe parking and the place also has a pool and rest area for complete relaxation.  With this review, I DO hope they don't plan to raise the price because we plan to return if they'll let us.  Mahalo Elizabeth and Chuck and don't change a thing.

It is close to several places to eat, get coffee, shave ice, etc.  The complex has a lovely pool, easy laundry services and nice on-site staff. The condo itself is nice and the lanai opens onto a lush green space which provides privacy and a lovely view (major bonus and best part of the condo!) but unfortunately the pullout double bed in the front room is very uncomfortable. I wouldn't recommend the condo for anyone who plans on having someone (adult or child) sleep on the pullout bed. We had our 5 and 8 year sons on the pullout couch and even they complained about how uncomfortable the bed was.  The condo is a perfect spot for a couple who want easy beach access, walk-ability to stores and restaurants and enjoy their coffee on the lanai each morning.

There was enough towels for my trip, as well as plastic silverware, refrigerator, and a microwave for those that want to save a few bucks on food. The room itself is by the elevator, so you can hear the elevator when someone is on it. The room had fresh sheets on the bed, and it was a decent size bed for 2 people. Also very comfortable for being away from home! As far as parking, if you rent a car, there is hotel parking that's $25 for 24 hours. When approaching check in, it was a bit confusing since there wasn't much explanation. The first entrance to the hotel has mailboxes and lock boxes. That's where you'd pick it up. Once you have the room key, then you are able to park in the hotel parking. The attendants in parking aren't the nicest people!

It has a great view. There was a full-size fridge and microwave. The bathroom was also full-size and clean. Once I got through security, access was easy and fast. The bed is soft, but comfy. AC works well, though it is a bit noisy (it's a window-unit.)\n\nThe Bad: The place is tiny. Overall size of the entire unit, including bathroom is about 10-by-15 feet. It is just one room with a bed on one wall and the fridge and microwave on the other--more like a hotel room than a condo. The electrical cord for the fridge runs across the wall in a way that looks weird. The dresser is full of stuff--drapes, extra pillows, dishes, silverware, etc. so you can't use the dresser for your clothes. It also took me 3 days to find the silverware and dishes--they're there--keep looking. Weird. There is no closet, but there is a place by the door to hang things. (Its above the vacuum cleaner in the pictures.) There is no desk, no alarm clock and no way to plug anything in near the table or the bed, so if you need to work or to get up at a set time, you will need a fully-charged laptop and/or phone. Parking is $25/day, payable in CASH ONLY.  \n\nCould go either way: There is some religious imagery and signage in the condo.

The hotel itself is right next to a 7-11 and a laundromat. It's walkable to everywhere I needed to go. \n\nBecause of the location of Hawaiian Monarch it's along Ala Wai street which has lots of street parking around the condo, I did not have to pay $25 valet parking that's required at most hotels to park in the hotel. Instead I just looked for parking around the hotel, street parking is free after 6pm. Just pay attention to the signs on when to leave the parking spot. That was an extreme plus because that saves you $125 for 5 days just in parking. \n\nThe check in and check out process was as simple as can be! You won't have any issues. \n\nI will definitely book here again as it saves so much money and the savings can go to other Hawaiian attractions instead.

The host, Karim, is a delightful young man who is hospitable, respectful and very able—thus, a great host.\n\nWe stayed here with two elderly people, and their comfort was of utmost importance to us.  We therefore had a lot of questions prior to booking the apartment and before our arrival.  Karim was prompt in his replies and diligent in his answers. Everything went smoothly and according to plan. \n\nThe apartment was clean and in tip-top shape when we checked in.  One thing we loved was the bathroom, which was very spacious—offering not only a bathtub, but also a shower.  The kitchen was clean and aptly equipped, which was nice.  Nice big couches as well!  Being a high-rise building, the view was also great.  This is a relatively small apartment, however it does not feel like it at all.  The people who work at this apartment building—those at the reception etc.—are also very helpful and able persons.  They assisted us whenever we needed the help, which would have probably happened even if Karim did not also talk to them on our behalf upon our arrival.   \n\nHowever, the biggest asset of this property is probably its location.  It is situated at the heart of downtown Montreal.  If your desire is to do all the touristy-stuff Montreal has to offer especially in the summer, this apartment is ideally situated.  For instance, the day after we arrived (July 1), the Canada Day Parade took place only a street away (5 mins walk).  A couple of days later, a cycling race happened right in front of the building, which was a lot of fun to watch.  Quartier des spectacles, where the Jazz Festival was happening, is only a couple of metro stops away.  The Old Port/Old Town is about a 10 min taxi/car ride.  \n\nThis location should also prove ideal for families from outside Montreal who wish to visit the numerous universities in Montreal.  Both Concordia* and McGill are at a walking distance, and UQAM is again only several metro/bus stops away.  This may also apply to scholars. (*Not Loyola Campus, but the downtown campus)\n\nIn all, we were very happy with our stay.  Great host, great apartment, great location, and a most wonderful city. \n\nAlp\n\n"},{"_id":"201087315","date":{"$date":"2017-10-07T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8861779","reviewer_id":"32533211","reviewer_name":"Yahia","comments":"Amazing place great host, I really recommend to anyone who want to be near in everything, clean, safe, and has everything u want.

This was technically a transaction between two parties (three?). I will stick to the facts and you can draw your own conclusions.\nI booked my first trip using airbnb on Oct 15th (credit card record) . Since it was my first time I email with some questions but didn't hear back. I wasn't alarmed since it seemed to be a hosting business posting through this website.\nOn Nov 18th, three days before my trip I email a second time. The host never replied me. On Tuesday Nov 20th at noon my spouse was able to talk on the phone (we weren't sure about bringing linen, parking and/or how we would get the key). Everything looks fine, he will be waiting for us, be sure to text 30 mins before getting there.\nSince we were planning on leaving at 5 am, I went to bed early. At 11:33 pm I got a text message that couldn't make sense ... checked my email and there was a message about a heating issue and that ...\" I unfortunately wont be able to get the heating system back in operation before your arrival.Please accept my apologies.\" I wasn't sure how to proceed, would I get the apartment later in the afternoon? What does it mean? I went back to bed thinking I need to get up earlier; will check my email later and hoping for good news.\nAt 1:13 am. I got a second text saying my reservation has been cancelled. Now I was suddenly awake. In a couple of hours I need to wake my family up for a 7 hours drive to a metropolitan city where we don't have a place to sleep?! \nBy now I have 3 emails from airbnb in my inbox ... at 1:13 am with the cancellation ... 1:28 am with a ticket number ... 1:37 am some manager following up ... \nOne of the emails have a button to get a refund or a button to rebook. \nI booked a hotel using a well known travel website, once I got my confirmation I requested a refund (which shows now in my credit card with Nov 22nd).\nSo as far as my experience was, I won't be using or recommend airbnb. Maybe it was an isolated case, maybe the heating was really broken, I don't want to hurt anybody's business but something didn't add up. As a consumer I felt completely vulnerable. \nBy the way: I don't know how much information airbnb shared with the hosts but to be able to book you need to upload your drive license and/or passport, a recent picture and I might be forgetting something ... I spent hours preparing this trip that almost didn't happen, but maybe because I knew the destination pretty well I was able to fix it quickly. \nWhat I'm not so sure of fixing quickly is removing my personal data from airbnb."},{"_id":"220943731","date":{"$date":"2017-12-24T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8861779","reviewer_id":"920325","reviewer_name":"Normand","comments":"Suite à un problème avec l appartement que j avais loué, on nous a donné un autre appartement un peu plus petit mais plus luxueux.

Above all a free parking-space in the garage and a heated pool outside. A really amazing extra was the free coffee-service in the lobby from Mon-Fri which we really enjoyed.\nOur apartment was - as promised - in the heart of Downtown and also only a few steps away from \"Crescent Street\" with all its bars, pubs and restaurants.\nPrior to our visit I was al litte concerned if the central location might cause too much noise but in the end we heard nothing. No noise from the streets or any neighbours.\nThe only little thing that was missing was a hair-dryer (or maybe we just didn't find it....?). However, due to the hot summer-temperatures it was not really an issue for us and I'm sure Karim will handle this. ;) He has a back-up for nearly everything and if something is not working or missing just let him know.\nWe would definitely stay in the apartment again!"},{"_id":"325400598","date":{"$date":"2018-09-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8861779","reviewer_id":"19164701","reviewer_name":"Emmanuel","comments":"Bien pour visiter Montreal 2j."},{"_id":"329784139","date":{"$date":"2018-09-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8861779","reviewer_id":"201410423","reviewer_name":"Chris","comments":"The apartment was great and the building was also very nice.

We have been greeted by Murat's friend who lives on the lower ground. He has ensured that if I needed anything I could have always contacted him. I have had family and friends popping in and out frequently who fell in love with Murat's cats. Location is amazing and as it has been mentioned in the previous reviews, the view from the living room and the terrace is spectacular. There is everything you could ask for in the area right by the door step; supermarket,  off-license open almost till morning, restaurants for all budget, souvenir shops , breakfast cafes open from 8am, bars. Trams and Busses are about 7/8mins walk as well as the boats to go to the Asian side of Istanbul. Galata Tower, Grand Bazaar, Taksim Square are some of the few walking distance places. If I have to consider one disadvantage , that would be the stairs in the apartment - perhaps if a family with a young child and a buggy would stay in the apartment or someone with an elderly, there are quite a few steps to keep your fit :) \n\nBest Wishes,\nCisel (London)"},{"_id":"154841102","date":{"$date":"2017-05-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8863253","reviewer_id":"9485971","reviewer_name":"Thomas","comments":"It should be a real pleasure to stay in this flat, the hote was very available and nice.

The neighbors from the other flats in the building come up to sit in the balcony, and are friendly, welcoming and charming.

All the basic things are in good working conditions.

Non-smokers should not be put off though, as the flat is well ventilated and doesn't smell of tobacco. \nThe cooking facilities are fine, but you probably won't want to use them much as there are so many fabulous places to eat nearby at all price levels, which, generally, are much lower than anywhere else we've been in Europe. What's more, you can just pop over to Asia where the prices are even better.\nMurat keeps a couple of cats, which I think are rescued street cats. They are very affectionate, seemingly flea free, and enhanced our stay. \nTo sum up - Istanbul is amazing fun, great sightseeing, great shopping (bargain hard, but keep it friendly!), fabulous food, good local wines, very friendly, wonderfully  atmospheric and, by European standards, very good VFM, but tough for anyone who is disabled.\nWhen you come to Istanbul, Murat's is the place to stay, just so long as you're ok with cats."},{"_id":"334758894","date":{"$date":"2018-10-10T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8863253","reviewer_id":"115536351","reviewer_name":"Warren","comments":"4 flights of stairs as advertised - spectacular location.

It is spacious, clean and tidy, which is quite hard to find the central part of Hong Kong Island. It is located about 5 minutes away from Sheung Wan MTR station, which is quite convenient. The building is surrounded by delicious restaurants. It is also right next to PMQ (a new area for creative and innovative artists to display, promote and sell their work) if you exit the building from 3/F. \r\n\r\nQuan was very helpful and responsive. She prepared everything for us and we only needed to pack our clothes! She also kindly left us the key card to access the gym room in the building. We enjoyed playing with her cat as well and I can assure you, it is the friendliest you will ever meet!

He has a big painting along the wall in the hall of the house so we were asked to paint something in there. We really enjoyed it and we thought it was a really good idea. Regarding the room, it is really small, so there was space just for us and our small bags. Anyway our stay was short so we didn't spend much time in the house. For sleeping 4 nights it was good and I consider a great value for money. It is a better choice instead of backpackers. The house is cozy and well equipped in all areas. The toilet is shared and it could be a bit cleaner. Anyway it is enough for a short stay.

The bed was very comfortable. Everything was just as Wyatt described on the listing. Wyatt is a very well prepared host when it comes to briefings on how living together can be more enjoyful. I really liked this and it makes everything running more smoothly:). As stated, the room is a little small but all our stuff (one big suitcase, two large backpacks and a drone case) fitted well in there.

They made the check-in process easy. They are both knowledgeable about Sydney and Australia. They are both polite about the many house rules. The small bedroom was big enough for two backpackers, and being next to the bathroom on the other side of the house gave it a more private feel. Wyatt's apartment is in a great location: walking distance to several restaurants and cafes; 470 bus stop just down the street that takes you to Central (\u003c15 mins); and walkable (a little longer, ~35 mins) to Newtown and Redfern. The text description of the apartment is more forthcoming than most hosts', and accurate. We feel that there was a large discrepancy between the photos and the actual state of the apartment.

My wife and i loved the place. It's a very quiet village with friendly people and lots of options for food and coffee. It is not too far from CBD and if you want a quiet/peaceful environment, Annandale is the perfect location.\n\nWyatt's place- we loved staying at Wyatt's home. We didn't get to meet Wyatt and Julie as they were travelling during our stay. Erika hosted us instead. She was very helpful and accomodating. The house is literally less than a minute to the bus stop (470 to the City and 370 to Cogee Beach).  The location is just 15 to 20 minutes to the City. Very convenient. We enjoyed our stay at Wyatt's place. There's a rustic, homey feel to it. The room, although small is just about right for my wife and myself. We even spent 1 day just being lazy in the room and drinking coffee in the balcony.  I will not hesitate booking the same room on our next visit to Sydney. I recommend Wyatt's place and please read his instructions first so you would know what to expect. All in all, we had a great stay in Sydney and our trip was made even more memorable by staying in Annandal and Wyatt's place. We miss it already.

Only one would be that the house is old, with creeking floors everytime someone walks by, so if you are a light sleeper/ gets annoyed by noises, this could be a concern.\n\nWyatt and Julie were also friendly, sharing with us about Sydney's hangout spots and some local insights on them. They were also very hospitable during our stay, constantly checking if we were all good during our time there.\n\nOverall happy with the place!"}]}

It was exactly what we were looking for, as we had tickets to an event at the arena within Olympic Park and wanted accommodation within walking distance.  One of the reasons we enjoy using Airbnb is to get to know local neighbourhoods of big cities, such as Montreal’s Maisonneuve. The apartment actually exceeded our expectations - it is as pictured and described; very well stocked with what we needed for a comfortable stay; we parked our car right in front and either walked or used public transport to get wherever we needed to go (Olympic Park – Biodome and Planetarium a short walk – and we took the Metro into the Montreal Old Town); appreciated the maps, tourist info and book with Valerie's personal recommendations of nearby restaurants, services, etc. including the nearby Maisonneuve Market.  After our busy days, it was great to come “home” to our classic “Montreal walk-up” apartment!

There’s also plenty of space to relax on the rocks if the sand is not your thing.  Within 100m of the beach are 3 cafes, including the epic Pilu Cafe for a coffee with ocean views, and the trendy Cafe Calm for an afternoon burger and beer after all the hard work at the beach!  To kick start your day after a morning swim, venture into Freshie Village (only about 500m from the beach) for even more epic cafes.

We stayed for a week and honestly felt as comfortable as at home. The beds are large and firm and there are additional blankets provided if you need them. There is a good sized supermarket located one street away next to the Coleseu auditorium. The apartment is very well located being within easy walking distance of a number of bars, restaurants and many of Porto's attractions. \r\nI would recommend staying here if you want a good base to explore the city and have the freedom to live like you are at home.

João has welcomed us very warmly and he provided us many wise tips about restaurants and nice places to visit.\r\nThe location is just perfect. Quiet (despite what I had read on some reviews) and basically right in the city center. We suggest you to try Confeitaria do Bolhao, just a few meters away. Having breakfast there gets you in the perfect Portuguese atmosphere.  If you happen to be in Porto on a Saturday, it is worth visiting the Bolhao market, just in front of the Confeitaria.\r\nLast but not least, you have to try the heavenly juice named after this city: Porto wine. On the south side of the river you'll find plenty of historical cellars that you can visit and get a wine tasting at the end of the tour. We recommend Ferreira, the only 100% Portuguese one that has been left totally original. On the other end, you can also enjoy a relaxing time having a Porto Bliss (my new favorite cocktail) on the Sandman terrace with a view on the river."},{"_id":"81300247","date":{"$date":"2016-06-22T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8923160","reviewer_id":"11617493","reviewer_name":"Mino Et Pierrot","comments":"Joao est très accueillant, souriant, répondant bien à nos besoins, donnant des conseils sur les lieux à voir, les restos à fréquenter...

Ganz abgesehen davon, dass Porto eine wunderbare Stadt ist, haben wir den Aufenthalt in der Wohnung sehr genossen. Miguel hat auf uns in der Wohnung gewartet und uns empfangen. (Die Wohnung ist leicht mit der Metro vom Flughafen aus zu erreichen.) Er hat uns die ganze Wohnung ganz genau gezeigt und alles wichtige erklärt. Die Wohnung sieht genauso aus wie auf den Fotos! Alles war sauber und schön eingerichtet. Daraufhin hat uns Miguel noch zusätzlich auf einer Stadtkarte, die wir am Flughafen erhielten, Sehenswertes in Porto gezeigt und uns einige Restaurants empfohlen. Er nahm sich Zeit für uns und beantwortete alle unsere Fragen. Miguel war sehr freundlich. Die restliche Woche standen wir nur über airbnb in Kontakt. \nDie Wohnung ist sehr zu empfehlen! Sie ist sehr gut mit Küchenutensilien und allem Nötigem ausgestattet. Jedoch würden wir die Wohnung nicht für mehr als 3 Personen empfehlen, da sie klein ist und nur ein Bad hat. Für uns drei hat der Platz aber deutlich ausgereicht.

Very modern, had everything we needed and we felt very relaxed. It was easy to find from the metro, a direct line from the airport. It was close to so main shopping streets and sights, and a 25min metro ride to the beach. An excellent, central location. We really appreciated Miguel taking the time to point out key sights on a map and let us in on some local knowledge regarding top locations to eat and where the night life was. He pointed out handy places such as the closest supermarket as well. Small touches that really made our stay wonderful.

I used to live in Manhattan, but now that I actually see the city skyline every day, I feel even more like a New Yorker.  Williamsburg is typically know for: outdoor festivals, live music, art, vintage stores, new designers, cutting edge food, rooftop parties, fashion, bike culture, hipsters, interior design, and my favorite part about Brooklyn: a friendly neighborhood community. We are in Williamsburg proper here at Bedford Ave, not just a nearby subway stop to it or a far walk away. The waterfront area is the most desirable part of Williamsburg, and Bedford ave is the main street. Everything is close, and neighborhood is safe. There are people out and about all day/night hitting the nearby restaurants and bars. This is the first subway stop in Brooklyn from Manhattan, and the first Brooklyn neighborhood right off the bridge.","notes":"Please don't lose our key because we will have to charge you the cost of replacing the lock at $90. We take security in the building very seriously : there is video outside of the building that surveys the area for strangers, video intercom, an alarm directly linked to the police station, etc. There is another video in the hallway linked up to an alarm. We are all set up here even though it's a very safe neighborhood in a community that looks out for each other. The neighbors are all wonderful.

What a great place to stay while in Brooklyn!  The HUGE patio alone, is a rare commodity in Williamsburg!  The apartment was huge, especially by NY standards and the furnishings, a testament to the owner's tasteful design aesthetic, but oh so livable and comfortable.  How could I have almost forgotten the views!  From the patio, there is a view of the beautiful Williamsburg bridge and at night this provides a twinkling backdrop that is magical.  \r\nLacey was a wonderful hostess and provided everything needed for a 5 day stay.  It would have been easy to entertain here too, but we were out and about most of the time.  For those who don't know the Williamsburg area, it is in the middle of world class restaurants and yet, only one short subway stop from Manhattan.  Would I recommend this location for your stay?

Her and her husbands apartment is one of the nicest I have seen in New York having spent 6 months there. Large, beautifully decorated, cosy. And although I have seen the Manhattan skyline many times it is was a very special experience actually waking up to it. For those people who don't know the geography of New York well, the location is incredible, less than ten minutes from many of the newest and top restaurants and bars - and not the flashy/overpriced ones that you often find over the river. Finally, at the risk of sounding crude, it is extraordinarily good value compared to not only hotels but also other AitBnB apartments.

The view from the bedroom is astonishing, having had more than once the opportunity to gaze upon the skyline of Manhattan in the blue hour. The Zenith of the apartment: the terrace with its staggering view on the Williamsburg Bridge.\r\n\r\nThe welcome was heartily, we got free drinks and Lacey made breakfast for us in the morning :)\r\n\r\nWe can highly recommend staying over with Lacey \u0026 Stu in their rare and exceptional apartment.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for the time and your obligingness.\r\nWe will definitely come again! \r\n"},{"_id":"41100921","date":{"$date":"2015-08-04T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"894063","reviewer_id":"13384645","reviewer_name":"Caroline","comments":"We feel so lucky to have been able to stay with Lacey and Stu in their beautiful apartment. \r\n\r\nThe place is exactly how the listing describes it, but the views from the balcony and bedroom window are so much better in real life.\r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood is awesome. We ate at a couple of local restaurants which we found to be much cheaper than Manhattan, and went for drinks (based on Lacey's recommendations) at the Wythe hotel and Maison Premier which we loved. The apartment is close to the subway and there are plenty of shops/services on the doorstep.\r\n\r\nLacey and Stu are wonderful, very kind and accommodating. We particularly enjoyed watching movies, especially on the rooftop terrace (we'd pay £30 per ticket for such a privilege in London).\r\n\r\nWe'd highly recommend the apartment and will hopefully be back in the Christmas run up, sometime in the future.

EVERYTHING else is there. The view is stunning from the balcony: a rainforest, mountains, birds, its phenomenal. And you're right next to the ocean! Their condo is like stepping into your friends house to house sit. The beds are extra comfortable, the place is so spacious and perfect. Two couples can easily have ample space here. There is plenty of parking, it's quiet but lovely with active people on the main roads in the subdivision. There is a golf course seconds away, you're right next to town which is less than five minutes by car. You're less than 10 minutes away from Hanalei Bay, Lumahai Beach, the bird sanctuary, and about 20 minutes from Ke'e Beach and the Kalalau Trail. \n\nBeach towels? Check. Beach chairs? Check.  Coolers for day trips, water bottles, laundry detergent, check check check. \n\nThe hosts are very responsive but do not intrude on your vacation in any way. This place could not have been more perfect. \n\nGrocery store is around the corner. Restaurants too. Check out Walmart for good grocery deals. \n\nLadies: There are swimsuit stores that are about 1000x better than anything I've ever seen on the continental US and they're 5 minutes away from the condo. \"Scrunchie Butt\" is THE style everyone is wearing. :) Don't be caught in the uncool bikini style I brought. :P Do yourself a favor and pick up a new amazing suit in Hanalei. \n\nBest trip ever. :) Thank you Shana \u0026 Jeff!!

If you are sensitive to any man-made (low-frequency) noise  at night - like we are - then this could pose a problem. Otherwise, everything was wonderful - Jeff and Shana are very responsive hosts and really tried to make our stay comfortable (i.e. providing us with body boards the next morning after our request - as  we couldn't access the closet where they were supposed to be stored). It was relaxing to have breakfasts and dinners on the balcony - beautiful view!  We also left a beach umbrella/tent for the next guests in the condo.

Otherwise, the cross breeze at night cooled the apartment and we were mostly out during the day.  The bed was comfortable.

Barra da Tijuca is the biggest sand beach (15km) of Rio de Janeiro and one of the hottest neighborhoods in Rio de Janeiro, if not the hottest. Located approximately ten miles west of Copacabana, Barra, as the locals call their home, is a Brazilian beach neighborhood that has a decidedly American feel. If you want to meet native people go directly to barra da tijuca beach, on which tourist could be sometimes a rare treasure. Spending time at the beach and seeing what the local restaurants have to offer are just two of the options for things to do in Barra. This is also an excellent shopping destination. On a Barra da Tijuca shopping spree, you can hit the largest shopping mall in Latin America, visit any number of smaller shopping malls, and check out the goods at a variety of upscale boutiques or specialty stores.

The photos don't do it justice! All of the furniture, fixtures, appliances, flooring, and walls are modern and new. The bathroom especially was very clean and new looking.\r\n\r\nIt's in a great part of East Village. It's very convenient to the subway, bars, restaurants, groceries, and stores. Drew and his roommate provided excellent advice for local food and drink.\r\n\r\nIt's an ideal size for 2 or 3 people. We were a group of 4 adults, and although it felt slightly cozy at times, we definitely felt comfortable!\r\n\r\nThe rooftop deck is amazing, especially during sunset! It's very large with lovely views of the city. The trade off for such a useful and beautiful deck is that the apartment is on the sixth floor of the building. Be prepared to climb them every day!\r\n\r\nThe apartment was well stocked with linens, towels, toilet paper, dishes, cups, utensils, and more. Andrew let us use his new and nice appliances: dishwasher, fridge, freezer, microwave, oven, stove top, and clothing washer/dryer combo. It was so convenient to have access to all of these! For technology, the apartment has wifi, a nice flatscreen tv, and an Apple tv. \r\n\r\nWe slept peacefully each night. The building is not noisy at all and we cannot hear the neighbors. We also slept comfortably; the double air conditioning is strong and refreshing!\r\n\r\nCheck in and check out were a breeze.\r\n\r\nAndrew and his roommate are informative, communicative, and generous hosts.

He was flexible and great to work with.\r\n\r\nThe apartment is in the East Village in a great location with lots of restaurants and amenities within a 5 minute walk. The area is safe, even at night, and always buzzing. The apartment has a living room, 2 bedrooms (1 double bed, 1 single) with a small kitchen and bathroom. It was clean and bright and of course the roof deck (up a flight of stairs) was wonderful- particularly sitting up there on Drew's furniture watching the sun go down on the NY skyline!\r\n\r\nThe only downside is that it is up 5 flights of stairs and I certainly had to take a breather near the top. Also, there is Apple TV and Netflix/ HuluPlus but no 'basic' tv channels- I quite like to watch ESPN Sportscenter in the background, but then again you are in NY and won't be sitting around watching much tv anyway.\r\n\r\nI would recommend Drew and his apartment highly."},{"_id":"20904442","date":{"$date":"2014-10-07T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"902482","reviewer_id":"17617849","reviewer_name":"Sofia","comments":"The apt is very nice and located in a perfect area!

The apartment was clean and in a very nice and safe area, Andrew was nice and very responsive. Both things contributed to a very nice first trip to the city. Especially the surrounding was outstanding. You have to travel around five minutes to be in Brookylin and maybe 10-15 minutes to be in Downtown. This was also a great aspect about the place."},{"_id":"258766604","date":{"$date":"2018-04-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"902482","reviewer_id":"64746723","reviewer_name":"David","comments":"The apartment is situated on the last story and there is no elevator: if you have any reason to have trouble with this (young children, health problems...), it's probably best to look elsewhere. \n\nThe apartment is small but nice and absolutely clean and well tidied. \n\nAndrew left some coffee for us upon my demand: I suggest him to always make breakfast basics available to guests (coffee, tee, sugar), as well as cooking basics (salt, oil, vinegar). \n\nFinally, Andrew was very reactive when communicating with him, and helpful."},{"_id":"261484032","date":{"$date":"2018-05-06T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"902482","reviewer_id":"91075521","reviewer_name":"Kate","comments":"Leaving a 4 star rating for a 3 star experience because Andrew did his best to remedy an uncomfortable situation and re-credited some money back to my account for the inconvenience.\n\nTHE GOOD - Andrews place is perfect for a quick getaway to NYC. The downtown neighborhood is a great place for people who are looking to experience the city away from the tourist traps in midtown. Check in was a breeze. His place was extremely tidy with comfortable beds and was plenty enough room for the 3 of us that stayed for the weekend. He was extremely thoughtful to leave a list of food/drink recommendations out for us as well.\n\nTHE NOT SO GOOD - Upon our arrival, after walking up five flights of stairs with all of our luggage, we entered an uncomfortably hot apartment. It was almost 90 degrees in NYC that day, and had been in the 80's for the past several days. After looking around, (and also referring back to the airbnb listing to verify that we did indeed book a place with air conditioning) we found two window A/C units stored on a shelf in the second bedroom. They were too high and too heavy for us to reach on our own.\n\nAfter calling Andrew, his initial response was that it was unseasonably warm for early May, and that me being from Baltimore meant that I was accustomed to hotter temperatures than New York. Baltimore isn't south of the equator. It has comparable temperatures to New York, maybe +/- 5 degrees. I knew to pack for hot weather, my friends knew to pack for hot weather, and as a host he should have been better prepared for the hot weather. It was extremely uncomfortable getting ready for dinner that evening, as Andrew was not able to come install the units until 9:30/10:00 that night. I feel like I also need to add that Andrew did not have a spare key to his own apartment. This would have required us to either cancel our plans and wait for him to arrive, or to leave all of our belongings unlocked inside the apartment. \n\nAs I stated before, this was very much a 3 star experience. I personally would not book this listing again. But Andrew did attempt to make the situation right by reimbursing me for the inconvenience."},{"_id":"265535248","date":{"$date":"2018-05-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"902482","reviewer_id":"10639978","reviewer_name":"James","comments":"A great stay in East Village New York. \nAndrews apartment was in a great location near all the bars and within walking distance to most NYC attractions and subways \nAndrew was a friendly host who welcomed us to the apartment and provided us with his tips on where to eat and drink. \nThe beds were comfortable and rooms air conditioned."},{"_id":"276063322","date":{"$date":"2018-06-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"902482","reviewer_id":"3051201","reviewer_name":"Sarah","comments":"loved this 13th st apartment. the location was great and the apartment itself was perfect for myself and my two daughters. we felt very comfortable and at home there. wonderful stay!"},{"_id":"278676581","date":{"$date":"2018-06-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"902482","reviewer_id":"60990555","reviewer_name":"Sarah","comments":"Great stay!

The property is directly on a river popular for stand-up paddling, and a short walk to numerous beautiful beaches, where you can swim, surf or snorkel. In the evenings you can sit on the dock out the back and watch the turtles swim up the river. The property itself is clean, spacious, exactly as described on the site and beautifully decorated with local artwork, and would suit either a couple or family. For nature lovers there is wildlife a plenty in the vicinity. The owners Morgan \u0026 George who live next door are very sweet and welcoming, with helpful ideas for things to do on our stay. We had a wonderful time at Hale Muliwai and would certainly return.  \r\n\r\nPlaces to visit nearby: Banzai Pipeline, 15 mn drive to see surfers take on the big waves or go snorkelling in the nearby rock pool at Shark Cove. Kaena Point, 20 mn drive plus 1 hr flat walk each way (or you can drive with an off-roader) to western-most point of Oahu with Albatross colony, monk seals and whale-watching. Polynesian Cultural Centre, 30 mn drive, expensive day-out but it is a great place to visit if you have children and worth the cost if you go to the dinner and show.

The custom reclaimed redwood cabinetry in the bath and master is stunning, as are the kitchen cabinets. Appliances were all in excellent condition and the BBQ on the lanai was used nearly every day. Everything we needed was at hand, including beach chairs, shopping bags, towels, books, TV, washer/drier etc. In short, we felt like we were home while staying here. The view of the river from the deck was exquisite and the daily visits from the peacocks were a wonderful sight. Highlights for us were the ability to walk to several beaches and into town (we didn't even take our car out for the first 2 weeks), paddling with the turtles on the river and bay, napping in the afternoon sun on the lanai daybed and exploring some of the off the beaten path places that Morgan and George told us about.

The listing looks even better than the photos, and I would recommend everyone who stays here to paddle up the river even if i wasn't brave enough to do so myself.

Morgan is very open to your suggestion of what you need. There's a DVD player and Netflix and other streaming on a big TV with a comfortable viewing area. The Barbeque was  a dream come true. It worked with no trouble and didn't burn anything unless we left it on too long. The most amazing thing to the 4 of us was the amenities: Plenty of soap, shampoo, tissues and good books too. You could move in here for a month or more and feel right at home. The washer is under the house, but the dryer is in the closet in the house and there is a useful drying rack on the lanai with a table, chairs a love seat and a day bed and still lots of space! Very relaxing. The Original Art was beautiful, the \"coffee table books\" gave us the impression that these people know art and then the paintings proved it. The decor was nicely blended and the materials used: floor to ceiling made us feel like the people who made this place, were really special too. Be sure to ask about the Turtles!\nAlso, the location was very central, with no problem parking."},{"_id":"246999470","date":{"$date":"2018-03-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9061835","reviewer_id":"53491826","reviewer_name":"Nelli","comments":"over incredible. highly recommended"},{"_id":"248577598","date":{"$date":"2018-03-31T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9061835","reviewer_id":"179674432","reviewer_name":"Griffin","comments":"Perfect home base for the whole island.

The location is beautiful and tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the city but close to local shopping and a quaint downtown area. There’s a beach, restaurants, and multiple coffee houses within walking distance. Eating dinner on the back porch, overlooking the river, really gives you a perspective on what is important.\n\nWe stayed here with our 3 year old and while I’m in my second trimester of pregnancy and it was comfortable and cozy for all involved. The only thing that could make it any better is one window ac unit, but I suspect with the breeze that’s not necessary most of the year (we were here in August). I’d highly recommend Morgan’s place, and Morgan as a host. She was also incredibly accommodating of our late flight time and allowed us to stay late so that our toddler could get a nap in before our overnight flight. You really can’t beat that kind of hospitality.

We used the updated/modern kitchen for most of our meals and of course tropical drink preparation. Raised above the street (with a parking spot underneath) there was light traffic but nothing that kept or woke us up during our week-long stay. \n\nMost days we ventured out to explore the island before or after our son’s nap and spent the rest of the day in Haleiwa town.

The location is great - steps from a great beach for sunset (too crazy for swimming though) and a short walk down the bike path to the best snorkeling and easy swimming beaches on the North Shore.  We rented bikes (which was super easy - they came and dropped off/picked up! North Shore Bike Rental) which made it super easy to explore further to the incredible beaches in the hood. The food truck set up down the street has 8+ killer dining options and is right next to a grocery store - all a ten minute walk - which makes food a cinch. \n\nThe interior of this house is lovely - super comfortable and well decorated. One note on the bedroom setup - the room pictured with bunk beds is in a bit of a shared space (folks have to walk through it to get to one of the 2 bathrooms or to get to the upstairs bedrooms) so make sure that whoever plans to sleep in there goes to bed late! \n\nOverall our group of 6 friends (two couples) loved this place and hope to come back and stay!  I highly suggest making sunset margaritas and walking down to the beach behind the house (about 100 yards down a little path between houses) to join the handful of folks doing the same thing.

It was a great location, easy walking  to the local supermarket which had everything you could want and need, the food trucks, and the lovely beaches. There was beach equipment hire gear near the food trucks too, but it was a bit more expensive than hiring it at the nearby town of Haleiwa.

Best of all was the kindness of the hosts - Margaret not only came to pick me up from the station, but also stocked the train carriage with simple, delicious supplies (sourdough bread, tomatoes, eggs, fresh basil etc) so I could make my own meals in the tiny kitchen. Other highlights include the hammock/day-bed which was perfect for reading in the sun, and the three gorgeous dogs who were endlessly playful and amusing. I would recommend this place to railway enthusiasts, vintage lovers, and anyone who wants to immerse themselves in nature. I hope to stay in this beautiful place again!

Everything about this place exceeded our expectations.  \r\n\r\nThe condo is a 10-15 minute walk to Waikiki.  The building is on the waterfront across from the expansive greens of Kapiolani Park with Diamond Head in the backdrop.  I like the quietness of this area yet close enough to Waikiki to be convenient. The so-called Local Beach is right next door.  It's quiet and much less crowded than Waikiki Beach but if want to enjoy Waikiki Beach, it's less than a 15 minute walk away.\r\n\r\nAs for the condo unit itself, it is tastefully decorated, fully equipped and very functional.  We could tell the host puts in a lot of efforts and thoughts into making the unit a home away from home for the guest renters.  \r\n\r\nTerri, the host, returned every one of my inquiries in a most timely manner.

Spacious, comfortable, nicely decorated. The location is as good as it can get in Honolulu. In an oceanfront condo, right in front of Diamond Head, away from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki, yet only steps away if you're looking for cafes, restaurants, nightlife, beaches, etc. We used to live in this area and it is our favorite in town. Terri and Cal were very helpful. We had an issue with the wifi router and as soon as we informed them, Cal went to buy a new one and replaced it immediately. This apartment is excellent value for the price. We will definitely try to book it for our next Honolulu trip.

The space was clean and was most accurately represented in the photos provided. The location was perfect...on the beach, just off the center of activity yet within walking distance to all of the events, activities, restaurants as well as  easy access to  the main thoroughfares for travel to other parts of the island (includes parking for a rental car was a great feature). The amenities of the space were also just as noted, coffee maker, microwave, etc. Of singular exception was the bed which was beyond  fabulous. A perfect nights sleep every time.  Experience has left us with the typical 2-3 nights to get used to it...this was automatic, lights out!\r\nOverall, I would assess Theresa as a terrific host and the  property as an excellent value and would recommend it as a great place to stay if one were to visit Oahu and all its sites. Albeit beaches, island access, restaurants both neighborhood and tourist or even just a sunset view with a glass of wine from the properties private beach front you can't go wrong."},{"_id":"114626519","date":{"$date":"2016-11-19T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9099615","reviewer_id":"10711134","reviewer_name":"Dolly","comments":"The host canceled this reservation 76 days before arrival.

Host was always prompt in replying to our messages.\n2. Place was spotless, well decorated, and well equipped.\n3. Location was perfect for us; close to everything yet more quiet (spent one day at the Hyatt Regency Waikiki and the police/ambulance sirens were going all night).\n4. FREE Parking (spent $35 per day to park at the Hyatt garage). \n5. Air-conditioners and TVs in both the bedroom and the living room (watched the local news daily).\n6. Washer and Dryer on site.\n7. All information about the condo were accurate (we had no surprises).\n8. Flexible check-in time.\n\nThe could-be-better:\n\n1. Condo is on the water but I would NOT recommend swimming for children due to sharp sea floor (could get cuts on feet). If you decide to swim in front of the condo, use swim shoes. Note: Within a couple minutes walk you are on a nice sandy beach (did not affect us at all that we had to walk a couple of minutes)."},{"_id":"212431109","date":{"$date":"2017-11-17T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9099615","reviewer_id":"5668418","reviewer_name":"Tammy","comments":"My partner and I spent 11 nights at Terri's place and it proved to be a great experience!  The unit is exactly as depicted and matched our needs.  As the access to the only bathroom is through the master bedroom, the unit probably works best for a single couple - but there is enough space with the pullout couch in the living room if you need it.  \n\nTerri was great to deal with, and was very responsive, including bringing us a kettle when we requested it.  The building is close to others and the 4th floor unit has only a peekaboo view of the park  and Diamond Head (if an ocean view or lots of light is important for you) but the location was perfect for us - across from a lovely park and close enough to walk to Waikiki and the beach, but with a quieter residential feel.

Stayed there for 3 nights. I would recommend this place to budget travelers who will be out most of the day, but needs a convenient, safe, comfortable and clean place to come home to. Most reviews say the room is small, which is a standard in HK. But our room (and the toilet) did not feel cramped at all - unless you're a really big person. We only had handcarries but a trolley or two can still fit in the room. No closet though but there's space to put your clothes, toiletries, etc all over the room. The guesthouse is very convenient location-wise. Everything is walking distance: A21 bus stops from and to airport, MTR Mongkok E1 exit \u0026 others, Ladies market and sports goods street, grand plaza, langham place mall. Early in the morning we eat at the congee places around the area for breakfast that elderly locals frequent. Just walk around and you'll def find one. One week before your stay, Ken will send you a FAQs sheet. It has all the info needed about the guesthouse and directions to the place which they have youtube videos of. Wifi was stable and fast. Mongkok is a very busy place with lots of people but the rooms are quiet and high above the busy streets. Security is stationed beside the elevators and monitored with CCTV cameras. Also, the guesthouse has 24 hour front desk. They're called a guesthouse but really functions more like a motel."},{"_id":"57055317","date":{"$date":"2015-12-21T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9138303","reviewer_id":"14347926","reviewer_name":"Xing","comments":"Directions to the place was given well.

The place is about 5-min away from MTR Mongkok Station and the receptionist was kind enough to accommodate us despite arriving on wee hours. The building where it is located looks kind of sketchy and dirty, but upon arriving at their receiving area on the 21st floor, it was brightly lit and well mantained. \n\nWe stayed at a standard twin bed room on which was cozy. The aircon was working well, as well as the television. The bathroom was really cute, just enough to accommodate the toilet and shower. The latter had a hot and cold option available, and shampoo and bath gel were provided for. Also, towels were readily available at our convenience. Free WiFi for guests was  available. There were essential items inside the room too like hair dryer,  electric kettle, plastic cups, toothbrush, and toothpaste. \n\nUnfortunately, the adaptors provided for us for the electricity plugs werent working leaving us with only one socket to charge our gadgets. We had a hard yome explaining this with the receptionist as she doesnt speak english. However, upon mutual agreement with our concern, she had the adaptors immediately the next day. \n\nOverall, our experience was really good :)\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\nOn 23 Aug 2016, at 21:34, Sionypacaldo  wrote:"},{"_id":"97458370","date":{"$date":"2016-08-27T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9138303","reviewer_id":"48964018","reviewer_name":"慈閒","comments":"價格很合理 房東也能很快回覆我的問題"},{"_id":"98051834","date":{"$date":"2016-08-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9138303","reviewer_id":"89970873","reviewer_name":"Joohyun","comments":"숙소가 몽콕역에 가까이 위치하였고\r\n큰대로변에 위치하여 편리했습니다. 주인이 친절하셔서 체크인도 원활했습니다^-^ "},{"_id":"98643245","date":{"$date":"2016-09-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9138303","reviewer_id":"14746649","reviewer_name":"楊珏","comments":"地理位置很好,房间设备齐全｡三人间的话稍微偏小,但是影响不大,性价比很高"},{"_id":"99752879","date":{"$date":"2016-09-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9138303","reviewer_id":"2807109","reviewer_name":"Gabriel","comments":"Great stay in Hongkong.

Nonetheless I can say that the magic of Porto, in my eyes, has a lot to do with people like Joao and Sara.  Firstly, Joao came to meet me and my two friends in the pouring rain in the dead of night.  Joao takes his job very seriously; he even left dinner mid way to pick up another visitor!  I know this because we dined with Sara and Joao the first night there at a wonderful gem called Frangos.  I don't want to make this comment too long, but Joao and Sara are THE BEST and the most generous, hospitable people I have ever met.  I plan to come back to stay in this apartment the next time I can make it Porto, which I can guarantee you will be soon.  I would consider Joao and Sara my friends, though Joao would probably just say \"oh my god i know right. what the fuck.\"  Missing you guys terribly.

There're some great restaurants just around the corner and you can actually take the food away and eat in the dining room to the sounds of gulls and old vinyls from the host's collection.

Holualoa is set in the hills of a beautiful artist village with a great cafe and restaurant holuakoa gardens and cafe less than a minute drive away! Finding the cottage was a little tricky for us located on a private road but once you find some good landmarks to know where to turn its pretty simple. We would love to return and make our stay back at the cottage, we would recommend this place any day!!

We enjoyed the cottage and would happily stay here again! In fact, we did at the end of our trip. \n\nWe arrived at night, and it was fine getting into the house. The roads are windy and narrow, so take it slow driving. The bedrooms were comfortable. The view from the porch (ocean and plants) was wonderful to wake up to. We were glad to sit on the porch in comfy chairs. There were a few mosquitos, but we bought bug spray. If you'd rather sit inside, you can, and the screen door and windows make it feel like you're outside. We used the washer to freshen up our swimsuits from several days of scuba diving, snorkeling, and relaxing times on the Kona beaches (and with sea turtles!)  Note, the frogs at night are loud and the roosters can wake you up in the morning, but we enjoyed the nature sounds!! \n\nThe surrounding area was nice for a quiet stroll but a ~10-15+ minute drive from the busyness of Kona shops/places to eat. We walked just down the road to cute little shops (galleries and cafe), which included historic signs describing how the buildings were in the early 1900s. Kona and this cottage were a great place to stay - highly recommended!!

There are also some harmless bugs, we don't really mind to get close to nature but it can be a problem with people who's afraid of bugs.

You're just barely out of Kailua-Kona (convenient for restaurants, shopping, etc.), but Sandy and Rachelle's place is upslope, about 1400 feet above sea level so you get a great view (although partial) of the town and ocean from the lanai. The lanai offers fantastic afternoon seating with filtered sun, shaded by a lemon tree. (Have you tasted lemon straight from the tree?  These are almost sweet!) \n \nThe cottage is very clean.  Sandy and Rachelle have also provided beach goodies such as boogie boards and a cooler.  \n\nDirections provided to get to the cottage were spot on and easy.  Another beauty of this location is that you can avoid hitting huge delays coming back into town after your day's activities in the north.  The state is working on the main highway (19) and afternoon delays stretched for miles north of town.  If you take Kaiminani Dr (1st left south of the airport), it takes you up to Hwy 190 where you can navigate back to the cottage on a much more scenic drive, and in much less time.\n\nYou must stay here."},{"_id":"238760917","date":{"$date":"2018-02-26T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9152841","reviewer_id":"172508190","reviewer_name":"Danielle","comments":"While my husband enjoyed browsing through the books in the house about the island, my daughter and I loved sitting outside taking in the view and the local sounds of nature.

Better for us than a hotel by a long shot as we like to cook our own healthy food. We found the place extremely clean, well organized, and well appointed with everything we needed. Its a sweet little place. Our only complaint, really, is that it is so small! Low ceilings, tight little kitchen and sitting room, and for a family of 4 with two tall teenagers it would have been too small to be comfortable for more than one night, at least for us - and especially on vacation, it would not have had enough stretching and relaxation room.

We were able to make fresh squeezed lemonade due to the huge lemon tree outside. Washer and dryer worked great and was able to do laundry with out a problem. Always had hot water for showers when we needed it. Roosters do crow in the morning but the local rooster next to this house does it maybe for max 15 seconds and to us was just part of the experience. We were used to it and it didn’t wake us up or bother us. There were beautiful sunsets from the lanai.

There are lots of roosters so we got the natural alarm go off at 5 am, if you dont mind that, you will certainly enjoy the stay. One word of advise is that this place can be hard to find the first time, so if you are checking in, try and get there when there is some sunlight. Also the road is very steep, so if you are renting a sedan, you are guaranteed to have some scratches under the bumper no matter how slow you turn.

Check out Monsoon India in nearby Kihei for some of the best Indian food you'll ever have \u0026 as well as Bluemoon Cafe for a good breakfast. We would stay here again."},{"_id":"179870029","date":{"$date":"2017-08-08T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9155739","reviewer_id":"66677365","reviewer_name":"Maki","comments":"Family of four  with two kids ages 4 and 6. Loved the condo - very clean and organized! The condo is on the ground floor so we didn't have to worry that our kids were stomping and disturbing ppl below us. We found the condo easily and were welcomed with a note and Hawaiian coffee package. We tried to eat on the lanai every chance we could get so we could enjoy the tropical garden view and a little view of the ocean. We watched the sunsets on the lanai and enjoyed the quiet atmosphere of Wailea Ekolu. The swimming pool is right around the corner and rarely had any people swimming. On the weekends there are more people at the pool. And I will say that this area seems like it has a lot of retired elderly - there were some elderly ladies who complained loudly about any family with kids who came to the pool. They even asked the kids to not swim near them. Fortunately we only saw them once during our week stay here. \nThe downside is the location because you can't walk to the beach- or you could (20-25mins) but not with two kids, a cooler, and beach toys. BUT this gave us a chance to check out all the beaches (Makena, Maluaka, Onelu, and beaches in Kihei). I'm sure if we stayed close to one beach we wouldn't have visited all the different beaches. \nWe are so happy we stayed here with such great owners who answered all our questions and made it feel like our second home. We would definitely book here again on our next trip!

We did a lot of cooking and found the kitchen amenities fulfilled our needs. The ambience of the condo was enhanced by the themes of water wave and sand. I found my self looking at the pictures located throughout numerous times. The proximity of beaches, shopping and walking distance to these amenities fit our expectations. The bed was the the best we have ever slept on in a rental unit, which is a huge bonus on a holiday.  The relatively unused pool and serenity of ekolu was also very noticeable. The sound of birds, insects and plants is not masked by the sounds of our normal everyday life. It was delightful. The lanai was of course a highlight. It put us in the midst of sun, wind, cloud and rain, and connected us to the natural world that we often close out from our northern lives. We loved this place and commend Rich and Gail, very helpful and kind hosts.  It would be great to thank them in person as opposed to writing this review. We definitely lived the \"spirit of Aloha\".
