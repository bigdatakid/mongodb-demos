It is located in a new, secure building within easy walking distance to Freshwater and Manly beach, shops and restaurants. There is a bus stop right outside the apartment building, and only a 15 minute walk to the Manly ferry.\r\nLeanne had kindly left us some pantry, fridge and bathroom supplies to get us started, we couldn't have asked for anything more! We spent many lovely evenings on the spacious balcony, enjoying the view of the garden looking out to the Manly lagoon.\r\nCommunicating with Leanne was easy prior to arrival, and she was always available for any questions during our stay. \r\nWe highly recommend a stay at Leanne's beachside apartment.

Tons of restaurants, bars, etc.\n-Greg is super nice and helpful\n-I thought the pillows were comfy.\n\nCons: \n-The bed is a Full but is listed as a Queen. This particularly was frustrating since this location having a Queen size bed was one of the \"tie breakers\" when I was determining where to stay.\n-The floors were dirty, some rags in the kitchen were dirty, and the trash in the bathroom was full.\n-It is a fourth floor walk up. The owner is very clear about this in the ad but it is still a con.\n-He did let me know the bathroom is small, but I found this one to be abnormally small. You have to turn side ways to get from the door past the shower to the toilet.\n-The trash is picked up every morning it seems between 2-4 AM. The windows need to be open to help regulate the temperature in the apartment. So it gets jarringly noisy for 5-10 minutes at a very bad time.

First, it is in one of the most happening places in New York City.  It is in Manhattan’s “Lower East Side” (LES) next to the historic Tenement Museum.  Guests staying at Greg’s place enjoy long bright sight-lines down two orthogonal  streets from the vantage point of being 5 stories up.  These long vistas are very rare in cities like NYC with its many tall buildings and are only available due to Greg’s (1) coveted corner location, (2) his 6 windows, and (3) highly-desired southeast orientation in the southeast portion of the city.\n\nProfessional photographers, good architects and other such artists conscientiously or subconsciously seek out long vistas and sight lines, lots of natural light, and other pleasing aesthetics when choosing or creating space.  Greg is no exception and his place clearly shows that talent.\n\nThe 6 windows bring those views and natural light into the main living space which uses 3 of them and the open kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom which enjoy the other 3.\n\nGreg’s love of art and photography is apparent in the decor.  We found everything to be clutter-free and clean.  There were ample towels, sheets, supplies, and such, and the 5G Internet was very fast which I tested to be 57.4Mb/s down with an amazing 8ms of latency.\n\nGreg’s LES location is walking distance to many shops, the subway, and restaurants, including vegan venues such as my favorite “byChloe.” Checking in was a snap and the late checkin/checkout times worked out perfectly as well.\n\nOne will be hard-pressed to find a better value in Manhattan that is so well connected and with as many pleasing views and natural light as Greg’s place.\n\nI intend on checking for availability first at Greg’s place whenever I travel to NYC.  He is well deserving of his SuperHost status and 5-Star Rating."},{"_id":"364880719","date":{"$date":"2018-12-31T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"552141","reviewer_id":"16439558","reviewer_name":"Matthew","comments":"The location is great.

Highly recommended. \n\nI had my wife and young son with me, and the space accommodated us well.

All you need to do is simply take a leisure walk. In terms of public transportation, there is a nearby bus stop at the main road that can connect you to the Bondi Train Station, and from here you can take train ride to the city.

Kazim very kindly picked us up in Fatih and drove us to his place in Eyup. He drove around the neighborhood a bit to show us the good restaurants, staircase down, bakeries, and grocery stores. Then parked on the very steep slope and helped us carry our stuff up to the flat. The flat was clean and had fresh fruit and some extra supplies waiting for us. The internet was fast and the two bedrooms were comfortable. And there were amazing views from the windows and balconies. We were there for the month of May which was very comfortable to just leave the windows and doors open to enjoy the breeze. Our favorite thing though was getting to know the neighborhood. We frequented a bakery, butcher shop, and vegetable market on the main level and a bakery and grocery above us. Nobody speaks English in the area, but they were so friendly and made an effort to help and communicate with us. This place is perfect for getting to immerse in the culture of Turkey. Down at the lower level, buses come every couple minutes and provide a 20 minute trip to Eminonu (Fatih) or 9 minutes to Taksim Square. The only downside is that this would be a tough place for people with disabilities.

And a feel of a historic home ... living like the (wealthy ...I guess) local İstanbul people. The apartment is great mix of value and  comfort and and is on 1rd floor\r\n\r\n Why stay at a exorbitantly priced hotel room with little space ...when you could have a whole family home for 40 to 50% of the cost of a small room. \r\n\r\nSummary\r\n\r\nThe best recommendation one can really give is … would you use it again … well yes …I am in this property again on the 1st September.

Simply a complete gem.\r\n\r\n I have stayed in Istanbul a few times ... gone from chain international hotels to boutique hotels to this. An evolutionary and postive move each time.\r\n\r\nand this is HALF the price of a room in a small boutique hotel ... you get a great apartment \r\n\r\n You are only 2 blocks from subway.... This is perfect for all type  of  travellers ... particularly families. . It has great wifi\r\n\r\nSo the net net\r\n\r\nComfortable and classy ... unique location with breathtaking view of central park ... and in a quiet building.\r\n\r\n. \r\n\r\nFINALLY ... Alexis/ Father are great Airbnb hosts! \r\n\r\n They live the values of values of Airbnb.\r\n\r\n\r\n This is:\r\n\r\n Be transparent ... Accurately... represent your listing.\r\n\r\nBe upfront about pricing, amenities, and expectations. \r\n\r\nUpdate your calendar\r\n\r\nRespond Promptly reply to messages \u0026 reservation requests. \r\n\r\nCheck-in Coordinate check-in time \u0026 key exchange well in advance of the actual date. \r\n\r\nWelcome your guests with a big smile! \r\n\r\n\r\nSimply ... look at the photos ... and book it.

I would strongly recommend getting a car service for airport pickup and return, as we did,  if you have more than one small roller bag, as it is a pretty long walk from the main square drop off point for the shuttle bus or subway, plus the steep incline on the 1 1/2 block down to the apartment from the main street.\r\n\r\nWe would for sure stay with Alexis if we returned to Istanbul again.

Close to grocery stores and a food cart was just steps outside the rental...hot sandwich which was pretty dang good.  Easy walk to metro station.  Travel guides a plus.

I would also recommend this flat to anyone staying in Istanbul who wants to be in the central part of the city but on a quieter side street that is not so loud as parts of Taksim can be really loud. So, this flat was the best of both worlds being close to the action but quiet for when we wanted to relax. The hosts had great communication with us for our arrival and meeting at the flat was easy. They even left us an IstanbulKart to use the public transportation which was really nice and useful to get around town. Can't wait to stay here again.

Dishes etc are all new. \n\nWe really liked the layout as there was a nice dining and working area and a separate and spacious lounge with comfortable seating. The decor is very relaxing and we felt very at home. We arrived when the temperature was cold at the beginning of January but the suite was lovely and warm with excellent heating and double paned windows. Alexis very thoughtfully provided books on Istanbul, maps and guides and also a variety of novels by Turkish authors. Nice touch.  \n\nWe enjoyed walking Istiklal Street, to the Sultanameht area, Galata Bridge, Besitkas, the list goes on.  We took a Bosphorus tour with Turyol which was very good. There are hundreds of tiny, delicious restaurants and bakeries within walking distance and some higher end venues as well. We like to walk and found we could reach most \"must see\" things within 15 minutes to an hour or the metro was nearby (5 mins) and there are taxis always at Taksim. \n\nWithout question we would recommend staying at Alexis' heritage suite.

The apartment was comfortable, with all basic amenities, plus air-conditioning and Wifi.  Alexis had sent us useful information beforehand on how to get to the apartment, and Alexis' father was waiting for us on our arrival and showed us the basic features of the apartment and reviewed the few rules (take off shoes on entry, keep windows closed, how to use keys).  There are a few things which could make things easier for visitors:  (i) a more accurate map showing the location of the apartment; the one Alexis sent us - which we appreciated - had some inaccuracies, and both my husband and I, arriving separately, had a little trouble finding the right street and the right block, although we did find the apartment eventually; (ii) the router for the Wifi needed to be restarted several times - Alexis had left a note to that effect, but without indicating where the router was located.  Once we found it, attached to the wall above the front door, we had to stand on a chair and reach up to get to it - only my daughter and my husband could do this; I was too short, so if it had been up to me to restart it, I would not have been able to do it.  What was a minor inconvenience for us could be a bigger inconvenience for shorter visitors.  (iii) we had some trouble figuring out how to use the washing machine, particularly how to get it opened when we thought the wash was done; my husband finally figured it out, but it wasn't obvious, and some instructions on how to use it correctly would be helpful; (iv) most important, I tried to contact Alexis while we were staying at the apartment, in connection with the washing machine, by email and by phone, trying both telephone numbers he gave, and was unsuccessful.  He never answered my email and I couldn't get through on either number.   Visitors need to be able to reach him with questions or problems.  Having said all this, we would recommend the apartment to others - it was really quite a good place to stay."},{"_id":"36370757","date":{"$date":"2015-06-28T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"555588","reviewer_id":"18131083","reviewer_name":"Prashant","comments":"Alexis is a caring host.

The apartment is very clean and comfortable. The white goods are of high quality. We liked not wearing shoes in the apartment. The apartment is some distance to Galata bridge and to the area of the blue mosque. It's about a 3-5 km walk or is accessible by the F1 from Taksim Square and T1 metro.

If you want to discover the rest of this beautiful city, you can take the Metro or the busses at Taksim Square.\r\nIn general, we had a wonderful week in this apartment in Istanbul.\r\nI can highly recommend this apartment to everyone, who wants to discover beautiful Istanbul."},{"_id":"130189479","date":{"$date":"2017-02-05T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"555588","reviewer_id":"65974459","reviewer_name":"Osama","comments":"Excellent apartment.

The photo's on AirBnB do not do it any justice at all.  It was absolutely clean, smelt sweet and was tastefully decorated (even freshly painted) and clutter-free.\r\n\r\nPete was a great host, upon arrival he gave me a full run-down of the apartment and the surrounding areas, even highlighting places of local interest on my map!  He was available at the end of a phone whenever I called (which was literally only at the beginning to arrange key-collection) nothing at all cropped up that I needed him for during the rest of my 2 week stay.  \r\n\r\nAll amenities in the apartment worked great, cooker, heating, power shower, toaster and internet.  There is also a laundry room in the basement (I never used it) but can see it being useful to some.\r\n\r\nLocation was also fabulous, in SOHO's \"European\" NY  next to Little Italy and with streets full of good eateries.  Then just a few subway stops away you can find the hustle and bustle of times-square.  Closest subways were Houston Street (2 minute walk) or Spring Street (5 minute walk).\r\n\r\nPete was also flexible on the check-out arrangements allowing me to stay until 3pm before sending in his cleaner at 4pm.\r\n\r\nWould definitely stay again.\r\n\r\nThanks Pete!\r\n\r\n"},{"_id":"164951","date":{"$date":"2011-01-04T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"55737","reviewer_id":"248682","reviewer_name":"Antti","comments":"Thank you Pete for renting your apt for two weeks.\r\nFew minute walk to broadway, west village etc and subways are just around the corner.\r\nEverything went well with our stay in NYC (and wireless internet in the apt was a huge plus!)\r\nPete was very very helpful and really nice guy.

My friend and I stayed here for 3 nights and had a fantastic experience.\r\n\r\nPete was very responsive to emails/texts throughout the booking process! Marie, Pete's wife, came to check us in and she was very kind and incredibly helpful! She even emailed us a list of restaurants in the area to check out!\r\n\r\nSpeaking of food----there are tons of cute/tasty restaurants in walking distance and lots of shopping as well. Lombardi's pizza (well known and arguably one of the best in NY) is about a 15 minute walk down Spring St. We also ate at SALT which is one block down King st where it dead ends into MacDougal. It was phenomenal. They even comped us an extra dessert. :) And at the end of the night, all we had to do was walk down the block and we were home. Perfect!\r\n\r\nGreat location! Also close walking distance to just about any subway line you need to take you anywhere. Whether you're going to Times Square or the MET, you can easily get to where you need to go!\r\n\r\nSomething else to consider, most of the apartments I've seen/been in in the city are walk ups. This unit is on the second floor---ideal location. Not at ground level, but not so far up  that you pass out after carrying your luggage up the stairs. \r\n\r\nWe had a wonderful time and would definitely stay here again!

The kitchen had all the cooking utensils you'll want, if you want to eat in and being able to have some french press coffee was a plus!  \r\nA high quality air mattress was also available for that extra bed, which was great. \r\nAir conditioning works well, as it was HOT in NY in July.  The place also had access to a great laundry and fast wifi. \r\n\r\nBoth Pete and his wife Marie were really fantastic with communication and responded to any questions immediately.

His apartment is exactly as pictured and was clean and had all the necessities eg. toilet paper, lots of clean towels, Wifi, a tv and DVD for down time (or while my husband waited for me to get ready) and such a big comfy bed (it was a true queen not a double called a queen which we have come across before).\r\n\r\nPete was there if I ever needed help and did not disturb us otherwise. Our friends who also booked through Air BNB were not so lucky. They booked an apartment in Hell's Kitchen which was supposed to be 2 bed 2 bath but ended up being one bed with an ensuite and a terrible fold out sofa. Their host let a friend just let himself into their apartment when they were there and it was terribly unclean. My point is that if you want a sure bet, a great holiday, great host and to not be disappointed when you arrive then I can strongly recommend Pete. Not only this but his neighbours were friendly and very helpful.\r\n\r\nLastly the location, in the popular West Village, of the apartment was a stand out for us. Last trip we stayed in Times Square and didn't truly get to experience the day to day life of New Yorkers. We were trapped in that overly touristy area and missed some really great places as our hotel was surrounded by a business district which was largely closed at night. Staying in the West Village meant that we were so close to all the other wonderful areas such as Soho, Nolita, Little Italy and China Town. There is a subway just around the corner that took us any where we needed such as Times Square and the Upper East and West sides. Strolling distance from the apartment was all the best areas for shopping and so many great bars and restaurants...we loved this place!!"},{"_id":"523255","date":{"$date":"2011-09-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"55737","reviewer_id":"673824","reviewer_name":"Jonas","comments":"As reviewers have mentioned earlier, the location of this apartment is superb!

There was also a study set up and a great wifi connection which made it really convenient for doing any work and admin. Pete was a great host, very responsive and helpful to any queries we had and made the whole process really easy and pleasant. I would definitely recommend Pete's apartment and would stay again next time we visit NYC."},{"_id":"15543490","date":{"$date":"2014-07-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"55737","reviewer_id":"11052738","reviewer_name":"Dean","comments":"The apartment was even better than expected - nice quiet building in a cool neighbourhood with good restaurants, nightlife, shopping and access to subway and taxis.

The home was exactly as shown in the pictures. I've heard from friends who are in the neighborhood that it's a rather big one bedroom for the neighborhood. Note that there isn't a microwave in the place but that seems commonplace in NYC.\r\nThe area itself is a paradise of convenience. Subways to Uptown/Brooklyn/Anywhere are within a 3 minute walk. There's a snazzy Vietnamese restaurant round the corner to people watch. The holy grail of NYC street food, MacDougal street, is but one block away. IFC cinema, \"cute\" West Village Streets, the madness of Soho are all within stones throw of a strong arm.\r\n\r\nYou can't go wrong with this place."},{"_id":"19615758","date":{"$date":"2014-09-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"55737","reviewer_id":"8779891","reviewer_name":"Agustin","comments":"El departamento es genial!

And 6th Ave is right there, so traffic noise can be a problem at night.

Pete was easy to get in touch with; he kindly checked in to make sure I was enjoying my stay, and additionally ensured that the check-in and check-out process was smooth and simple.

Very clean and fully equipped! One real and bright room with a big and comfortable bed. We didn’t cook, but everything seems present to do it. The bathroom is clean, with a bath and shower-pressure! Not very much natural light in the living room, but if you come to visit NY, you surely come back in the apartment in the end of the afternoon, or evening, so it’s not a big problem! The neighbors are quiet. Little, little noise from the street in the room (the street is very quiet for NY), so it’s not a big problem too if you come to visit (even if you come to work), the street wake up as you! The subway is at the corner, and other lines few blocks away. It’s a very convenient place to visit NY! The apartment is at the limit of Greenwich and SoHo, so it’s a very cool place with lots of bars and restaurants. And little supermarket not too far. We didn’t meet Pete (he was travelling) but it was easy to pick up/drop off the keys and he was easy to contact. Very accommodating too, we book the apartment one week before our arrival, and it was not a problem for him. The same to leave. We ask him to leave our bags a bit more time and he was ok! So everything was perfect!!! I surely recommend Pete’s apartment and if I’ll come back, I’ll book it again!!! Thanks again Pete for everything!!! L’appartement de Pete est parfait! Très propre et bien équipé! Une vraie et lumineuse chambre, avec un grand et confortable lit. Nous n’avons pas cuisiné, mais tout semble présent pour le faire. La salle de bain est propre avec une baignoire et de la pression dans la douche ! Pas trop de lumière naturelle dans le salon, mais si vous venez à NY pour visiter, vous rentrerez certainement en fin d’après-midi ou le soir, donc ce n’est pas vraiment un problème. Les voisins ne sont pas bruyants. Il y a un tout petit peu de bruit dans la chambre venant de la rue (la rue est calme pour NY), mais là encore, si vous venez pour visiter (et même si c’est pour travailler), ça ne sera pas un problème. La rue se réveille en même temps que vous ! Le métro est au coin de la rue, et il y a d’autres lignes à quelques blocs. C’est un endroit très pratique pour visiter NY ! L’appartement est à la limite de Greenwich et de SoHo, donc c’est un endroit très cool et il y a plein de bars et de restaurants. Et un petit supermarché pas trop loin. Nous n’avons pas rencontré Pete (il voyageait) mais nous avons récupéré/déposé les clefs facilement. Et Pete a été très facile à contacter. Il nous a aussi bien facilité les choses en acceptant sans problème notre réservation tardive (une semaine avant d’arriver), et en nous permettant de laisser nos bagages..."},{"_id":"194012729","date":{"$date":"2017-09-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"55737","reviewer_id":"8878688","reviewer_name":"Amir","comments":"Pete's apartment is located very well. we found a very clean and intimate apartment at a perfect location.

You can spend weeks just exploring the area surrounding the apartment. It's really fantastic. The subway station is 1 block away. The apartment itself was just as expected. It's located on a typical nice New York street. The neighborhood feels safe and homey. The apartment was clean, the bed was comfortable, sheets and towels were provided. You will find everything you need in the kitchen like coffee maker, electric water kettle, toaster, pots, etc.... but seriously, who wants to eat at home while in NYC :-) The bed was comfortable and a cute little desk in the bedroom by the window, allowed me to work in the morning while watching New Yorkers rush to work.

Let me start by stating that we are also Airbnb hosts (Super hosts actually) and do know the short term rental business. I specifically explained to the host that we were arriving early (after a visit to our kids' in College) and asked him, since we knew that the apartment was free the night before (by simply checking on the availability calendar), if he would allow us to check in a bit earlier. BTW, this is (or should be) customary in this industry, let alone if you are a \"colleague\". He couldn't care less about our requirement. Not only he took few days to respond (and to, at the end, deny it), he simply lied to us by explaining that the cleaning people were not able to come in earlier. When we arrived to the apartment and checked in, we came across the cleaning people and asked them if that was true. It was obviously not. Hard to understand the logic behind. To begin with, check in process is overall very complicated. Keys are located several blocks away from the apartment on a 7Eleven. It is a hassle, particularly if you come with lots of luggage or if it is raining (as it was when we checked out) or if it is cold. This should be noticed clearly on the description. It is not. You only come to acknowledge it once you confirmed the rental and have access to the Full house manual. You just can't come with a taxi, step out and get them, as where the keys are located is a very busy area (in the middle of Greenwich Village, right next to the Blue Note Jazz Bar, just a of block away from Washington Square Park). Quite inconvenient. Also, the apartment is located on the 3rd floor, on an old building. These are very high floors. You have to be ready for this. Although is (slightly) noted on the listing, there should be a more clear warning on what it takes to get to the unit. Although it is also noted on the listing, there is NO TV/Cable service... I know, I saw it, but again, another negative. Internet was not working the first day and it took the host several hours (until the following day) to respond. I had to access a video call and needed full speed Internet. Communication in general was slow. No A/C on the main room (just a fan) and only an old and very noisy A/C unit on the living room that clearly needs maintenance. This is simply not an apartment to come in plain summer with 85+ degrees outside. You will suffer. Some of positives: The location and the area are very good. Although is not technically SoHo, as published (the boundary is either West Broadway or 6th Ave. for some others), there are subway lines very close which are very convenient. The apartment was perfectly clean. Impeccable. This is an absolute must for us...."},{"_id":"332975809","date":{"$date":"2018-10-06T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"55737","reviewer_id":"169497322","reviewer_name":"Chaim","comments":"Great"},{"_id":"335214864","date":{"$date":"2018-10-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"55737","reviewer_id":"7878713","reviewer_name":"Logan","comments":"Well-located apartment with most basic amenities.

Having had a lot of experience with NYC throughout my life and knowing how difficult it is to find a decent place to stay with enough space to keep one from feeling suffocated, I can easily say that this apartment is a gem. It’s a 1-bedroom apt with everything: full kitchen with refrigerator, freezer, stove (4 burners), oven, microwave; a bathroom that has a full bathtub/shower combo (many places don’t have this), and the bedroom has an amazingly comfortable bed—way better than what I’ve found at most hotels (I travel constantly for work, and the bed in Pete’s apt outshines hotel beds 9 out of 10 times). \n\nThe location of this place is amazing. It’s close to many wonderful restaurants and has very easy access to the subway, so finding something to eat and getting around the city is extremely convenient. If you like shopping, this is also the place to be, because the best shops and brands are a mere 5 min walk down the street. \n\nThe only thing to be aware of is that this is a walk-up to the 3rd floor—so it can be a little difficult moving in if you have more than a single bag (my stay was in the middle of a month-long tour, so I had a lot of stuff to carry), but otherwise, the stairs are a great burst of exercise!\n\nCan’t say enough good things. Pete is an attentive and concerned host. His reliable hospitality and all the great features of his apt are the reasons I keep coming back year after year. Don’t miss out on a chance to stay here!"},{"_id":"366865168","date":{"$date":"2019-01-03T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"55737","reviewer_id":"98383731","reviewer_name":"Peader","comments":"Nice cosy place, right next to a subway station for easy access around the city."},{"_id":"409701091","date":{"$date":"2019-02-08T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"55737","reviewer_id":"33391812","reviewer_name":"Christine","comments":"Fabulous location, on the edge of SoHo and West Village!

Лучшие коты тоже здесь :)\nСам Альбер был в отпуске, но нас встретила его сестра. Они заказали трансфер из аэропорта и все время были с водителем на связи, так что мы просто переходили из рук в руки)\nКвартира на верхнем этаже, в доме ещё 3 квартиры, которые переделаны под музыкальные студии, так что часов до 11 вечера кто-то учится петь и играть на гитаре, но нам это не мешало. \nЕсть огромная терраса с видом на Босфор — зимой она скорее для фоточек, чем для посиделок, поэтому придётся вернуться в более тёплое время, чтобы оценить. \nОчень мягкая кровать. ОЧЕНЬ. Лежишь в ней как в гнезде. \nЕдинственный минус — неудобный унитаз. Колени упираются в бортик ванной. И нет шторки в ванной, но это не беда. \nЗато в квартире тёплый пол, и это огромный плюс зимой, гораздо круче батарей. \nНет яркого освещения, только точечные приглушённые светильники, и это создаёт очень романтичное настроение. \nВ целом мы очень довольны, жена уже мечтает вернуться."}]}

The scroll through price was $110 p/n but there were extras of $35 for cleaning and a $22.15 service fee. These may well be standard Airbnb extras but on a one night stay I guess the cleaning fee to cost of stay ratio seemed a bit high. I knew the total fee before finalising the booking but I guess I would have liked the pricing better if it was all inclusive at $165 and not the $110 plus, plus .... one good flip side is when I shared a screenshot of where we were staying and a few commented that it seemed like great value at $110. The place is very nice and neat. We arrived at night and the host had left the garage lights on so we could see along the narrow path to the shack at the back. Later the lights were off and getting another load from the car was tricky although a flashlight was left on the kitchen table for this purpose. We never met the host but that was maybe due to our late arrival ...but I’m also ok with this as I’m a bit shy and I knew we could contact them easily if needed. It’s an awesome spot very close to a nice dock and a little beach as well as a swimming area.

The property is in a beautiful location right on Pittwater, with good on road parking. The quiet reserve just across the road has lovely views along Pittwater to Lion Island. \nThe cabin itself is compact, stylishly presented, very comfortable and well organised. The decking is a peaceful and shady place to relax during the heat of the day. We found we had everything we needed for an extended stay. \nMichy was a fab host throughout - always warm \u0026 friendly, respectful of privacy but quick to offer help when contacted. We enjoyed meeting her husband Paul and felt honoured when invited to the neighbours pre Christmas get together on the reserve. We had a super time with you Michy, thanks so much!\nHighly recommend staying here."},{"_id":"365008114","date":{"$date":"2018-12-31T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5581269","reviewer_id":"1122557","reviewer_name":"Stephen","comments":"Great place to stay on the Sydney northern beaches. very friendly and helpful host.

My only complaint about the Flatbook was that communicating with them was a bit strange and different from my other experiences with airbnb (I've always reserved with private homeowners). Though they were certainly responsive, the responses always came from a different employee and there seemed to be uneven communication between them, so I had to repeat my question/request and the backstory each time.

We very much appreciated the thoughtful gesture.\r\n\r\nWe were escorted to the flat and were pleased by the cleanliness and functionality of the space.  It was exactly what we had hoped for as well as being centrally located, near transit (metro), shops and restaurants.  It suited our purposes wonderfully.  We were also very pleasantly surprised to find the use of laundry facilities, including soap, had been included in the rental.\r\n\r\nThe only negative comments concern 1) the fact that this building has a lot of stairs to contend with.  So anyone with mobility issues would need to take this into consideration.  And 2) the television is not hooked up to any local channel.  Whenever we travel, my wife and I usually like to listen to local news and weather.  We managed to get some local information via WIFI by connecting the HDMI cable they provide to our laptop.  Flatbook may wish to add a section to their information kit listing local television/radio stations.\r\n\r\nOverall, it was a great experience and we will definitely recommend this to friends and family."},{"_id":"41079832","date":{"$date":"2015-08-04T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5618084","reviewer_id":"25227321","reviewer_name":"Sarah","comments":"no complaints! everything ran smoothly with check in and check out. excellent location, everything was as described "},{"_id":"79511411","date":{"$date":"2016-06-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5618084","reviewer_id":"51742088","reviewer_name":"Alexandra","comments":"The listing description was accurate!

In addition to the complimentary bottled water and chocolate bars, there was wifi, TV, extra clean linens,  private full bathroom, and a tiny but fully equipped kitchenette (except no sink) with fridge. Access to an outdoor hotel pool and coin laundry was also included. When we had queries re: the wifi and TV, Jason responded on airbnb within 5 minutes, came to our suite upon request, and helped us resolve the issues within an hour. Jason also offered a parking pass at an extra but low price, which was extremely helpful, since overnight parking is normally extremely expensive in the area. Also, we found that the snug suite was ok for the 3 of us (3 adults), even though there was only 1 room with 1 small but full bathroom (studio style). The suite size would fit 2 guests most comfortably. We thought the hotel hallways were poorly ventilated (had an odor at times), but Jason's suite was better ventilated (with the bathroom fan and the air conditioner), so we didn't notice any odor in the suite.\r\n\r\nWe ended up renting a car and mostly visited places outside of waikiki, but the suite is walking distance (around 20 minutes) from the beach and from the ala moana mall. We also rented a car at the hotel, but there are also car and moped/motorbike rental shops by the hotel lobby. The smart car rental place is only around $60 per day. If you prefer, Hertz and Dollar-Rent-a-car are just 5 minute walk away from the hotel lobby.

It looked just like how the photos showed, the view was awesome, the bed was really comfy, there was plenty storage, and pretty spacious to stay in. We loved that there's an extra set of towels because we were staying for 12 nights total, which was really fresh we could just use another clean set. \r\n\r\nThe location was a total 5 star, it was close to anywhere, to take trolley or buses. Although it wasn't on the beach, but it took only 10-15 minutes to walk to one, (I love walking down the street like that!) and comparing to the beach areas hotel, the price is really really affordable. The small kitchenette came really useful even thought there wasn't a sink by it, we just used the sink in the bathroom. \r\n\r\nJason the host was super nice, he provided everything we needed and asked for in a very short notice, always responded quickly. He welcomed us with macadamia nut and water bottles, and it was so nice he treated us with some local macadamia chocolate when bringing us some extra toilet paper. We accidentally broke one mug before leaving, we were trying to buy a substitution, but he said it was ok, he will get one, which was super generous and kind since we were in a rush to go to the airport.

We had the chance to meet Joao and his wife and they are both amazing people. Dealing with Joao was so smooth, from the very beginning; he is so nice and so helpful. He is reliable, trustworthy and very kind. Even before making my decision to rent his apartment, he nicely offered to help me plan my stay in Porto and suggest things to do even if I ever decided to rent someone else's apartment.... How kind is that???  I also really appreciated the fact that he communicated with me in French just because he saw on my AirBnB profile that French is my first language...

The entrance is up two flights of stairs. The second bathroom you will have to 'side saddle' the toilet. The downstairs bathroom floor had not been cleaned. Both bathrooms were mouldy and needed a jolly good clean with bleach. There was no soap or hairdryer but the very friendly staff found us a dryer. It would be very helpful to have a broom or dustpan and broom so we could clean the dirty floor. No one has ever vacuumed under the beds in a very long time. Lots of old tissues, dust and grime. The kitchen has the basics only. No oil, salt and pepper or any other such amenities. Towels were old and thread bare. All in all a very disappointing experience.

(You will never feel cramped in this room - as it can get in a lot of other rooms for rent in Barcelona.) The generous working table with its comfortable stool is an important plus if one likes/needs to work on a laptop. Everything is speckless and very clean. Above all, Onofre is a wonderful host. He is very friendly and from the first day of arrival until departure, communication was fast and easy. Even my late time of arrival or my very early departure was no problem at all. Onofre is very attentive if one needs anything or has questions. The room is located in midst of a lot of good restaurants and close to the metro. I can fully recommend to stay at this lovely gem of a room."},{"_id":"276233537","date":{"$date":"2018-06-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5624887","reviewer_id":"177006297","reviewer_name":"Carlos","comments":"Very clean and respectful living quarters and in  a central location."},{"_id":"277945941","date":{"$date":"2018-06-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5624887","reviewer_id":"9053282","reviewer_name":"Michele","comments":"El apartamento de Onofre es ubicado en uno de los mejores barrios de Barcelona.

Although he is works primarily from home and is there a lot, he gives you as much space and privacy as you need. The bedroom is large and bright with access to a small terrace, and the beautiful high ceilings make it feel even larger. The WiFi, desk, fan, multiple lamps, a full-size mirror, hot water pot and teas, hair dryer, and other amenities were much appreciated.

The apartment is in a fantastic location in copa, close to the Santa Clara area which has great shops and restaurants - as well as being just a block or two from the beach. I was very comfortable in my room and from the moment when I arrived in the middle of the night because of a delayed flight, Rosanne and her family made me feel very welcome. On a practical note, the apartment is great because as well as the excellent location, it has good wifi, a good shower with plenty of hot water and its up on the 9th floor so away from the busy road below. It's easy to get around by foot and is also close to the metro and plenty of buses. There is breakfast in the morning you even have your own little fridge in the room. Do not expect 5 star luxury - this is someone's home, not a hotel, but is all the better for it! There is no air con but the two fans worked perfectly well and overall Rosanne is very considerate and goes out of her way to make sure her guests are comfortable.\r\n\r\nThe other reason this is a great place to stay is that everyone in the building was so helpful and friendly - the doormen will always stop for a chat! Rosanne has two delightful children who are incredibly polite and thoughtful towards her guests, as well as being very sweet and fun to chat to. Altogether a very relaxed and fun family to stay with and a great way to experience staying in this wonderful city.

I enjoy the cosmopolitan lifestyle Mosman offers with its vast array of boutique shops, restaurants and cafe's. With it's own beautiful Balmoral Beach, Taronga Zoo, local cinema, library, Mosman Markets, and an array of parks and waterside walking trails, I truly believe this location to be idyllic. Above all Mosman's close proximity to the city means I can be 'at the office' in 10 mins!\r\n\r\nI love classical music and enjoy being around creative people. I think I have the perfect job in my capacity as Orchestra Manager of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. I am lucky to be able to call the Sydney Opera House my place of work, and daily enjoy the vibrancy and excitement of this iconic Sydney venue along with it's sublime location on Bennelong Point.\r\n\r\nIn addition to my work with the orchestra, I run my own business which specialises in providing classical musicians, ensembles, orchestras, singers and entertainment for a large variety of public and private events. These include weddings, corporate events, TV commercials, concerts, recordings, cruise ships etc\r\n\r\nI love travel and have a particular interest in European countries, history and cultures. I also enjoy meeting people, making friends, exchanging stories and generally interacting with others.\r\n\r\nI am really excited by the unique travel experience that Air B\u0026B makes possible for travelers, and look forward to welcoming Air B\u0026B guests to Sydney and to my beautiful home.\r\nRachel","host_response_time":"within a few hours","host_thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/03e989b8-fca7-44a3-9d1e-320c058f17e5.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","host_picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/03e989b8-fca7-44a3-9d1e-320c058f17e5.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","host_neighbourhood":"Mosman","host_response_rate":90,"host_is_superhost":false,"host_has_profile_pic":true,"host_identity_verified":true,"host_listings_count":1,"host_total_listings_count":1,"host_verifications":["email","phone","reviews","jumio","government_id"]},"address":{"street":"Mosman, NSW, Australia","suburb":"Mosman","government_area":"Mosman","market":"Sydney","country":"Australia","country_code":"AU","location":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[151.23796,-33.82529],"is_location_exact":true}},"availability":{"availability_30":23,"availability_60":41,"availability_90":71,"availability_365":326},"review_scores":{"review_scores_accuracy":9,"review_scores_cleanliness":8,"review_scores_checkin":10,"review_scores_communication":9,"review_scores_location":10,"review_scores_value":9,"review_scores_rating":92},"reviews":[{"_id":"32518644","date":{"$date":"2015-05-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5712086","reviewer_id":"30464763","reviewer_name":"Carla","comments":"We loved staying at this home the night before and night of our wedding- it was spacious, well appointed and beautiful!

The beds were comfortable and french provincial kitchen well equipped.  My daughter especially liked playing the piano.  The Mosman location was a treat as it was only a quick 800m walk to shops, including a supermarket and great take-away food / restaurants nearby were plentiful.  The beach at Balmoral (3 minute drive or 20 minute walk) was gorgeous, a short drive (2 minute) to Mosman Wharf had us on the ferry into Circular Quay with those amazing harbour views and Taronga Zoo was a 3 minute drive away too.   My husband travels to Sydney CBD frequently for work so I chose Rachels property in Mosman so he could experience Sydney like a local and how he has never seen it before.

Its a very comfortable space, with 2 large bedrooms upstairs, both having lots of light, a full and spacious bathroom and there is a small additional room downstairs (more a small office) that can be used as a third bedroom.  One of our group was older and had trouble with stairs so she stayed in this room which Rachel had made up with a single bed.  This room also has a toilet with sink off it so very convenient.  The kitchen is well supplied with cooking utensils, dishes, pots and pans so cooking was quite easy.  We even hosted a dinner one evening for our friends' aunt who lives here in Sydney.  About a 3 block walk from the house is Military Road, the main road in Mosman.  It is quite a busy street and this is where you would catch a bus down to the Mosman Wharf to catch a ferry into Circular Quay.  All very convenient and smooth connections, both going and returning home, as the bus is waiting for you when the ferry comes back to the wharf.  We enjoyed sitting on the back veranda having a glass of wine in the evening.  There is a deli close by, an IGA  supermarket and farmer type market as well, plus a bottle shop, all close walking distance.   We were most pleased with our stay here and would definitely recommend this home as your base in the city."},{"_id":"54975223","date":{"$date":"2015-11-27T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5712086","reviewer_id":"15410350","reviewer_name":"Alexa","comments":"Staying in Mosman at this stunning property really set us up for our stay in Australia.  We only stayed 3 nights and wished it could have been for longer. Photos were exactly as shown, it was lovely and cool in a funky suburb where you get to hang out with the locals. Found some great cafes round the corner for breakfast and lunch. Nearby Balmoral Beach was a great walk and well worth a visit as was the walk to Taronga Zoo for magnificent skyline views. Having a parking area for our 4x4 was a bonus and the outside seating areas were great. Just wish we had stayed longer to fully appreciate all that the property had to offer. Bedrooms lovely and airy with access to the verandah and sofas. Bathroom huge and loads of towels. Bedding luxurious and the beds were some of the comfiest ever ! Great experience and the memories of Mosman will stay with us. Thank you for making our first few nights in Sydney so perfect !

We chose Rachel's home for its location - close to the Georges Head venue of a family wedding, accessible to the City and easy driving to and from the airport. We had a car, so the off street parking was welcome - parking on the street was at a premium. The home was represented accurately in all photo's and the description. I also enjoyed tickling the ivories of the baby grand!

We had the good fortune to run across Rachels gorgeous home on Air bnb. \r\nThis place was amazing.  We were here visiting relatives and sight seeing from the USA.  Its wonderful to hear the kookaburras right in the city and all the beautiful birds. This place is like a garden oasis. Rachel was so lovely and gave us all the information we needed to make  this trip perfect. Our family of four was very comfortable and we felt very at home here. My daughter is studying music and played Rachels gorgeous piano while we were there which was an added plus.  This home is in the most perfect place. Military road is two minutes walking distance from the house and there are plenty of buses if you do not have a car. We parked on the street because we had a very large mini van and it was just easier. Plenty of parking in the surrounding streets if you need to but there is a private garage there as well for your use. \r\n There are wonderful cafe's everywhere and you are very close to Raglan street which takes you down to Balmoral beach. \r\nI cannot say enough wonderful things about this home but my kids and husband and I were sad to leave our home away from home.

There was a lot of other conveniences in the kitchen that was so much better than a hotel. That was thoughtful. It looked bigger to me in the photos and fresher. Maybe more current photos would represent it better. It is located close to everything which was nice and the kitchen had everything we needed. The dishwater was great and it had plenty of nice extras needed to prepare a meal.....lThank You for that. It is a drafty place and there seemed to be a lot of noise of cars driving by.( seems the street has become a busy pass thru)there was lots of banging noises in the morning that we solved by putting towels over the doorway to stop that( one of the bedrooms has doors that lead to an semi exposed sitting area that was blowing a draft if the doors were closed it kept banging REALLY loud, after the towel was placed on top it stopped the constant open and closing of it. And one of the brass window closures was also banging all night from the breeze, I moved it to stop that but it woke us. I wanted to use the Jacuzzi tub but tried three times and the hot water ran out before it could be filled to level of jets.Maybe a bigger hot water tank might solve that. Bathroom was really good otherwise, quite gorgeous and towels were great. Liked the hand held shower head and shower was plenty of room. The beds weren't as large as I thought, I believe they were full size instead of Queen or King which I expected for the master suite. The bedding and Dooners as well as pillows were great. The chairs downstairs had blankets on them which seemed like a great touch. There was major rips and not much chair support left in them under the blankets( FYI ) all in all it was a nice stay. I just expected a bit more for the money paid. Slightly awkward floor plan. Wanted the four of us to chill out to watch a movie it just was laid out awkward downstairs. Just thought that area was bigger . Laundry was good, never used the drier. Dishwasher is a plus and it worked great.check in and out was seamless. The key in the door thing was weird. You had to leave the key in the door or you couldn't leave. This was awkward when we went for a walk and left kids at home we couldn't take keys with us because they could get out otherwise. Parking spot was good. Back yard looked nice but the fountain was full of old water that was green. Verandah was lovely. There are motion sensors in three of the rooms which felt a little weird to me when they went on but must be a security thing. I know we hadn't put the security on. Electricity didn't work in the bedrooms..."},{"_id":"110244181","date":{"$date":"2016-10-24T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5712086","reviewer_id":"11383706","reviewer_name":"Anna","comments":"My family and I had a fantastic stay in Rachel's home. The house was beautiful and very clean. I chose this place because the photos looked amazing and it did not disappoint. I got ready for my wedding here and the house provided the perfect backdrop for our photos. \r\nThe 2 main beds upstairs were large and comfortable. Very spacious bedrooms with lots of wardrobe space. The only draw back was that it didn't have enough curtains in one of the rooms so it became really bright and sunny early in the morning when we wanted to sleep in. The single bed downstairs was great. \r\nIt was great having two toilets, one up stairs in the main bathroom and one downstairs in the laundry room next to the single room. That way we didn't have to go up and down the stairs for the toilet. \r\nAnother draw back was that two of the steel chairs on the dining table were missing its seat cushion so I used the bar stool cushions but it may be time to replace them. Also, the 2 single sofa chair cushions were old and worn out. It was covered by a blanket so you couldn't tell, but when you sat on it, the cushion would slide off the sofa with you on it. \r\nWe had everything that we needed like bath towels and extra blankets (the weather was cold during our stay). It was a 5 minute walk to the local shops and restaurants which was super handy. The garage provided was super handy too because street parking in Mosman fills up pretty quickly. \r\nI did not get to meet Rachel in person but we communicated via mobile phones.

The pictures on Air bib reflected house very well. Unfortunately there wasn't a house manual there which would help visitors with knowledge of the area etc. We arrived early evening time and weren't sure what was around in the way of restaurants etc but we walked around and realised we were close to the centre of Mosman and there were plenty of good restaurants within walking distance although a lot were closed on Monday evening. The house has probably been painted internally fairly recently and generally everything was clean apart from the kitchen especially the chopping board, glasses and the cupboards which were pretty cluttered. Wifi is a problem as it ran out very quickly however we asked Rachel if it could be topped up which she arranged for us but that also soon ran out. Really good sized bedrooms and a very small bedroom downstairs but that was sufficient for one adult for a short stay. The road was very noisy especially in the early hours of the morning but the house only has single glazing and some lovely stained glass windows. The garden furniture was ok but large chair had broken leg and was resting on a brick. There was a washing machine, tumble drier and dishwasher so that was really useful. It was a 20 minute walk to the ferry terminal but there is a bus service too.

Very comfortable. The third bedroom is more of a maid's quarters (with attached laundry room). If you plan to have a relative stay in that room, prepare for some feedback.\n\nMy only real issue with the home is the vehicle traffic. Do not understand how a narrow suburban road that is only 3 blocks long can support so much traffic starting at 6am, continuing to 10pm. Plus one day there were some early major deliveries to the facility across the street. [Not sure why this did not appear in other reviews. After my visit I rechecked the reviews. Traffic mentioned on page 3. Deeper than I usually look.]  Don't plan to sleep in.\n\nPerhaps this was the price to pay for convenience to Mosman village. Walked there for breakfast, lunch, dinner, shopping, wandering. Very convenient.

The fridge interior, kitchen drawers and kitchen floor were all food stained. We had to wash all the unclean cutlery, glasses, pots, etc before using them. We also found dirty items in the dishwasher. We wanted to use the outside table for a group lunch but the large umbrella appeared to be broken and fixed or stuck in the corner.  \n\nWhile the location is great to walk to restaurants, shops and down to Balmoral Beach, the noise of car traffic is very loud in the mornings. Difficult to sleep beyond 7am. The wifi did not work at all. We tried on many devices and nothing.

There is antique furniture as well as a lot of charming little things, original pictures within your possession. You will feel yourself better than in the best hotels and like at home at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe apartments locate not far from the ocean coast. It takes just 5 minutes by slow walk to come to the ocean to enjoy its breeze, to run or make your morning exercises or to have a breakfast in one among many restaurants and cafes, situated over there.\r\n\r\nThe place is also situated not far from the nearest metro station – you just have to cross the bridge (10 min by walk). But it is rather a pleaser than the obligation because the view from the bridge is really nice. It takes nearly 35 minutes to come to the center of Porto by metro. You also find bus stations and can take a bus to the center of Porto or any other place that you need. Taking into consideration than there are night buses in Porto, it is not a problem to spend a night in the city and come back by bus when ever you want without taxi. In the case if you don’t  want to go to Porto but have a fun at a place, you will also find a lot of nice cafes, restaurants and pubs close to your apartment.\r\n\r\nWe enjoyed our holidays at Mr. João place! It was perfect! We are very grateful to his and his house for a kindness and hospitality!"},{"_id":"4659602","date":{"$date":"2013-05-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"571382","reviewer_id":"5107809","reviewer_name":"Paula","comments":"My sister and I stayed at Joao's apartment May 15 - 18.  The home was lovely and exactly as represented on the website.  It is very well laid out - things like the laundry area were very functional since a drying rack is provided and you can leave the clothers open to sun and air without worrying they will blow away.  We appreciated the heaters as well as it was unseasonably cold in Porto.  Joao's furnishings and decor are lovely and the two coffe pots were a bonus since I drink tea and my sister drinks coffee.  We enjoyed the fruit provided and since we are Americans we loved having the DVDs in English to watch in the evening.   It is very convienient to the subway so we did not have to drive in Porto which was helpful and did not have to worry about the car as an underground parking space was provided.  Joao even took the extra step of providing a subway card for the first ride into Porto which makes the opening trip on a strange subway quite a bit easier.  Joao also went out of his way to find a cheese tour for us but  we ran out of time to take it.  We highly recommend a stay."},{"_id":"4758380","date":{"$date":"2013-05-24T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"571382","reviewer_id":"5616361","reviewer_name":"Lea","comments":"Joao was a great host! \r\nMy family and I stayed at his apartment for a few days in May and it was a wonderful time. \r\nAlthough we arrived at about 1am at night Joao wanted to pick us up at the airport, but since we rented a car there he waited for us at the apartment. It was really late but he had the time to explain everything to us and even came back to give us more sheets and covers.\r\nThe whole apartment is really big and nicely decorated, the kitchen fully equiped and the view from the balcony is wonderful. We felt at home the very first second we came in. (I just loved the bed, it was so comfy i didn´t want to stand up every morning) \r\nIn the fridge we found milk and juice and a big bowl of various friuts, that was such a nice gesture! \r\nJoao insisted that we could always call him if we have any questions, but there were so many leaflets and maps that it was hard to decide what to do first. \r\nWithin a 3-5 minute walk you are at a beautyful beach and if you want to walk a bit more there is a very nice promenade with a lot of restaurants, bars and cafes. \r\nAlso the next metro station is in walking- distance and the city centre is worth a visit (you have to do a wine tasting ;) ) \r\nIf I ever come back to Porto, i would always come back to Joaos Apartment and I would recommend it to everyone who wants a great relaxing holiday :) \r\n"},{"_id":"5320043","date":{"$date":"2013-06-24T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"571382","reviewer_id":"5122779","reviewer_name":"Vincent","comments":"Condo très spacieux et confortable près de la plage et en retrait du centre historique de Porto (métro agréable pour se déplacer).

He discreetly checked in via email after a week to see how we were doing and then bade us farewell on our last morning.\r\n\r\nJoao's apartment is luxurious and spacious, providing a restful base from which to explore the wonderful city and beachside of Oporto. It comes with all mod-cons, including a washing machine, handy for babies and washing out the beach towels used on the vast and safe strip of seaside just down the road. \r\n\r\nThe apartment is located in a cosy and friendly neighbourhood with lots of cafes and restaurants. What we loved about the place was the sense that it wasn't primarily a tourist designation, offering instead a view of Portuguese at rest and play. \r\n\r\nJoao's apartment provides a very comfortable home away from home and comes highly recommended - we hope to come back soon. \r\n\r\nJuly 2013"},{"_id":"5828686","date":{"$date":"2013-07-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"571382","reviewer_id":"6882082","reviewer_name":"Peter","comments":"João has a beautifully decorated and homely apartment, right in the heart of Leça, 5 minutes walk from the beach and 1 minute to shops, bars and restaurants.

Immaculately clean as well. We had all we needed at our disposal. The rain deterred us from being able to venture too far, however the location was perfect.

Back to the apartment, as previous users have mentioned, Joao meets you at a convenient place, walks you in, leaves some biscuits and instant coffee, and is happy to talk recommendations.

Joao had corresponded with us so frequently that we felt like friends when we arrived.  We felt like we were guests at our well-to-do Portuguese auntie's home.  It was fun cooking in the bright kitchen \u0026 sitting in the laundry room sipping coffee early morning when it was too cool to go out on the balcony.  The 2 bathrooms, dishwasher \u0026 washing machine made us feel right at home.  About the neighbourhood:  It is a real Portuguese neighbourhood \u0026 no one speaks English.  Downstairs in our building are many little businesses \u0026 cafés, very convenient.  There is even a dog grooming salon as well as a green space behind the building \u0026 a park across the street if you bring your dog like we did.  There are many buses running through the neighbourhood.  Just across the bridge, a short walk, is the Metro which will take you to the old city, the fabulous Bilbao shopping, Casa de Musica, or you can transfer at Trindade to cross the river to Gaia for port tasting or just walking along the river, very pleasant.  Going in the other direction from the apartment is the fabulous MAR shopping mall which is anchored by IKEA and the Jumbo.  The food in the food court is fairly good, abundant \u0026 reasonably priced.  If you're staying for awhile you might want to grocery shop at the Jumbo, a well-priced mega market.  If you have kids, that mall is for you!  It is kid friendly and had the most adorable clothes \u0026 toys."},{"_id":"30148496","date":{"$date":"2015-04-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"571382","reviewer_id":"29855332","reviewer_name":"Gabriela","comments":"Estadía perfecta.

Porto allein ist natürlich eine Reise wert und von Joaos Wohnung aus gibt es gute Verbindungen dahin.

The terrace was perfect - whenever everything gets too noisy and busy in the city, it's a good place to calm down for a bit and enjoy the city from another perspective.

Our cab driver had problems locating the venue, Can helped to direct him and waited out (in the rain) for our cab. \r\n\r\nMy friend and I \"check-out\" at different times. My friend was scheduled to leave in an airport shuttle that Can helped to book with a local tour company. As my flight was much later in the day, I scooted off to the Istanbul Modern (which is a really short 10/15 mins leisurely walk away) while she waited for the shuttle. But HORRORS! My friend left all her money with me and when her shuttle arrived, she had no money to pay for the service. Can graciously let her get onto the shuttle anyway with just a verbal promise that on my return to the apartment, I would be paying for my friend. He did not make any fuss about it at all nor was he anxiously reminding me to make the payment, so that's pretty cool.\r\n\r\nThe apartment was clean and spacious, pretty much exactly what you see in the photos. Noticed the aircon was dripping a little but that didn't affect our stay in any way. There were some stubborn stains on the white armchair but hey.. it is white, which is hard to maintain... so we weren't too fussy about that, we used it anyway, it wasn't disgusting.\r\n \r\nThe location is superb if you are visiting the Galata Tower and Istanbul Modern (which is awesome btw). It is also an easy walk to the Tophane Tram stop (max 5 mins) and the Galata Bridge (20 mins). \r\n\r\nThere are many interesting eateries around and we had a nice breakfast at the eatery next door - the pancakes are freshly made and really awesome. I also had superb spinach + cheese pide at this no-nonsense place diagonally across the street. The pide are cooked in a traditional stove. When I visited, there were many locals enjoying their pide there. Yummy. I love to eat food prepared by people who take pride in making them. :)"}]}

You get a very genuine everyday-life-in-New-York feeling, which I think is awesome. However, if you are not comfortable being around people of other races and cultures, you might not get to enjoy what this great neighborhood has to offer.  With in a few blocks there are many really cute cafe, restaurants and bars. Bedford avenue is kind of the main stretch, where you will find some really great spots. Essentials like laundromat, supermarket, 24 hr deli are also very near by. Please see my guidebook for local favorites.","notes":"I welcome mellow, easygoing guests who are looking for a genuine apartment share experience. All guests are considered housemates. Also, please do not request this room for someone else's behalf. The apartment is kept as calm as possible. Please do not dominate the common spaces, and please keep social activities outside the apartment. If you've read up to this point, please tell me what kind of doughnut flavors you like :)","transit":"With the A/C,G trains all within a few blocks, you can get to most places very easily and quickly. The A line is 4 stops away from downtown Manhattan, and it takes you to Tribeca, Greenwich Village, Meatpacking District, Chelsea and Time Square all in under 30 min. The G line takes you the ultra hip Williamsburg in 10-15 minutes.  From our apartment it takes 8 minutes to walk to the A/C subway, and 5 minutes to walk to the G subway. There are also many buses. I would of course be very happy to tell you more in detail once you are here.","access":"You will get your own key to the apartment, so you can come and go as you wish.

I live with my partner in crime, Hugo, the sweetest little pooch. Both of us have restlessly curious minds, which is probably what lead us to travel almost 6 months out of every year. Besides thinking about my next meal, I probably spend the most time thinking about my next travel destination. \r\n\r\nI was born in the US, raised in Taiwan, moved to the UK at age 17, then Italy for school. Before airbnb was made popular, I was a frequent couchsurfing host/guest. From a young age I started sharing apartments with other housemates, many of which became my close friends. Now I am really glad to be hosting on airbnb. I tend to treat whomever I meet like a friend, without unnecessary formality or customs.\r\n\r\nAs a person I'm quite levelheaded, affectionate, with a pinch of cynical humor I guess. Anthropology, linguistics, art, and music are some of the things that I'm most passionate about.

The neighborhood itself doesn't feel super gentrified and it was nice just walking around to get a sense of real Brooklyn. There's also a lot of cool restaurants that are walking distance! I would definitely love to stay here again and would recommend it to anyone :)"},{"_id":"75683822","date":{"$date":"2016-05-22T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"573671","reviewer_id":"23376442","reviewer_name":"Tomas","comments":"Olivier was very attentive all the time and although he don´t live in the apt, he is always present when you need.\r\nThe neighborhood is great, near subway stations, with many groceries and coffe shop nearby.\r\nThe apt is clean, quite, cozi and bright.

Everything was very easy and Nicole did everything possible to make my stay as comfortable as possible. \n\nOn entering the apartment I had two thoughts. 1- this apartment looks better than the photos. 2- this place actually feels like home. Nicole has gone to great efforts to make this apartment really feel like it's home. Everything from the Nespresso coffee to the lollies and little extras in the fridge for arrival. I was so thankful for all of this. \n\nThe amenities are great and a perfect, quiet location that is next to the city and so close to everything you need in Sydney. I would honestly say that this would be the most comfortable Air BnB that I have stayed in. \n\nThe only real thing that I would say about this apartment would be that it is more like a studio apartment, as opposed to a 1 bedroom apartment. The bed is elevated in comparison to the rest of the living space and private thanks to half height walls, though all the actual  walls are common in the apartment which I was surprised about when I arrived. I do believe that 1 bedroom would be classed as a bedroom being completely separated from the rest of the living space, also something that I look for when staying away from home. In saying that, it's still one of the best Air BnB's that I've stayed in.\n\nDefinitely recommended!\n\nThanks Nicole!"},{"_id":"46699450","date":{"$date":"2015-09-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5763156","reviewer_id":"1495813","reviewer_name":"Kylee","comments":"We loved staying at Cooper Street!

We appreciated the thorough communication and ease of hand-off for the keys.  We were especially grateful for the toiletries, guidebooks, laundry powder, and coffee provided - the attention to detail was wonderful!  The building requires the key to use the elevator, so we felt very secure. We would stay here again!  Be aware that the 1BD is separated by a partial wall, so if you're looking for privacy from the living room, it is limited.\r\n\r\nWe enjoyed staying in Surry Hills. It is convenient being so close to Central Station.  It seems to be an up and coming neighborhood so I would advise others that you should assess your level of comfort with urban life. By day, I noticed all of the cute restaurants, yoga/barre spots, and shops. (Simon and Nicole provided excellent recommendations as well!) By night, I noticed more of the remaining graffiti, vacant storefronts, and quiet streets.  If you do not feel comfortable in cities or would feel more assured with constant tourist traffic, you may want to spend more to be closer to CBD. For us, it was perfect.

Highly recommend and we will be back."},{"_id":"93190846","date":{"$date":"2016-08-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5763156","reviewer_id":"45747278","reviewer_name":"Tim","comments":"Stayed at Simon \u0026 Nicole's place for 4 nights at the beginning of our holiday, really easy to get in touch with and met us at the apartment even though we got there fairly late in the day. The apartment is in a great location for everything whether you want to catch the train or walk everywhere! It is very tastefully decorated \u0026  really appreciated the little touches like the nespresso machine \u0026 travel guides. I wish our bed at home was as comfy! Only negative was that the pool was closed for refurbishment, which can't be helped \u0026 was just our bad luck! There was a bit of building work out the back which was pretty noisy from about 7.30am onwards but on the plus side it got us up \u0026 doing things in the short time we had in Sydney instead of lying in bed! \nThanks for a great stay- have already recommended your place to friends!\n"},{"_id":"94489385","date":{"$date":"2016-08-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5763156","reviewer_id":"45341388","reviewer_name":"Lorraine","comments":"A really cool place to stay.

The location was great - it's centrally located near a main train station (Central) and it's a few blocks away from a grocery store, cafes, and restaurants.  It's a quieter neighborhood, which was perfect for us.  There was construction going on at the time, but Nicole let me know about that ahead of time.  The amenities were great - everything you could need.  The pool was being worked on, so that area was closed off.  When that space is back up and running, it's a great rooftop spot.  They even have a tennis court and Nicole and Simon provide you with rackets.  The bed was really comfortable and the layout of the apartment was perfect for a couple.  There was a day when it was raining, and we enjoyed snuggling up on the comfy couch, drinking tea, reading and watching movies.  They have a selection of movies available.  It seems they also had Netflix, but this was protected through parental controls, so we couldn't access it. It would be nice if there is an option for the renter to use their own account if they already have one, but that is really a minor thing in comparison with all the other great things this place offers.  Highly recommend staying here."},{"_id":"98726640","date":{"$date":"2016-09-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5763156","reviewer_id":"28408524","reviewer_name":"Dominick","comments":"Exceeded high expectations!

Om natten var vi desværre plaget af en del trafik lige udenfor døren og ikke mindst også larmen fra kirkeklokkerne, som ringede hvet kvarter !!!\r\nMen Top karakter til huset og haven.\r\nMen - huset var svært at finde på GPSen og da vi endeligt nåede frem (efter at have kørt forgæves til 3 andre addresser med samme vejnavn), så havde vi en del besvær med at forstå nabokonen, som  skulle udlevere nøglen og vise os rundt i huset. Hun kunne KUN tale og forstå portugisisk - men vi nikkede høfligt til det hun prøvede at fortælle os, og så fandt vi ud af det selv bagefter.\r\nHuset ligger i en meget lille by, hvor der absolut intet sker og den nærmeste butik ligger ca. 2 km derfra.

Das Haus liegt in einer Senkung an einer Dorfstraße und die Mopedfahrer geben ordentlich Gas um den Berg hochzukommen. Daher hält man leider die Fenster im Ess- und Wohnzimmer geschlossen. Bei dem schönen Wetter haben wir uns aber fast ausschließlich am Pool aufgehalten. Außerdem gibt eine nahe gelegene Dorfkirche alle 15min eine Melodie von sich ... auch nachts. Nach 2 Nächten hatte man sich aber daran gewöhnt. \nMeiner Meinung nach kommt daher auch der niedrige Preis für dieses Anwesen zustande.

We were there with our six month old son, and since laundry is a huge part of having a baby it was very convenient to have unlimited access to the washer and dryer. The bedroom was large enough for our travel crib and our belongings, and the sitting area/kitchenette area was a good size. The only drawback would be if you were wanting to cook a lot of your own meals as the fridge is very small and its not possible to buy much and store it, and there is limited facilities for cooking, but we were easily able to make breakfast daily, some lunches, and a few dinners as well. A great location in princeville, walking distance to queens bath, hideaways and sealodge beach (handy since there is no parking there most of the time), and close to a small shopping centre and to Hanalei Bay with all of its shops and restaurants (not walking distance).

You can walk to princeville center, or use her bikes to get down to the st. Regis beach, plus theres surfboards, boogie boards, and snorkeling equipment for all the fun you need. I did not have a car (would recommend getting one on kauai) so all this worked out great for me. I biked around and surfed the bay every day. Place was clean, had coffee, fridge and hotplate/pans to cook. Mahalo Paulina, a great stay.

Her place provides a nice place to land after time spent at Kauai's many attractions.  Her home is close to Tunnels Beach, Ke'e Beach and the Na Pali Coast.  Paulina shared her beach gear (umbrella, cooler, snorkeling masks and fins, and beach towels) bikes, and kayak gear. I cooked fish every night on the hot plate and baked brownies in the toaster oven. The bed was comfy and the space was homey. No TV, which might be a problem for some, but you're in Hawaii, so who needs TV!

Interaction with guest is limited but if you have a question Paulina is easy to reach. Very nice and easy going. The appartment is the bottom part of the house with a large uncovered deck at the back. You are sharing the appartment with one other airbnb room. There is one shared bathroom with a bath tub in it. The toilet is in the bathroom which is the only downside as when we stayed someone decided to have a bath in the evening so no access to the toilet for about an hour. The kitchen is simple but has everything you need to cook simple meals, pots, pans, dishes etc. There is a hot plate, oven/toaster. The living room is nice and cosy. Internet worked well too. The house is in the heart of princeville in a cul de sac, lots of kids around but overall its slick and quiet (except there was a kid gathering for easter and that was very noisy). Easy parking in the driveway and close to beaches too. Note that the washing and dryer are adjacent to the unit it can be noisy if people decide to do a load in the evening. Paulina was flexible for us leaving our bagage in the living on the day of our check out so it was convenient."},{"_id":"145353236","date":{"$date":"2017-04-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"578396","reviewer_id":"510107","reviewer_name":"Stephanie","comments":"Wonderful stay in a quiet area about 10 minutes from Hanalei Bay.

For starters the bathroom lock didn’t work and there was no way to lock up the room/house when you left. The neighborhood was very safe and never had any issues but some might not feel comfortable with that. The bed was also overly soft and our backs hurt every morning when we got up. The property was clean, but there were a few bugs, not a big issue. The location was fine for visiting north coast attractions but it was very far (2 hour drive) from Waimea Canyon and NaPali coast. I didn’t realize this when I booked this place since on a map it looks right next to it. Also due to all the rains/flooding/landslides this past April the road didn’t go past Hanalei so you couldn’t get to Tunnels Beach or the Kalalau Trail. Having said all of this Pauline was very nice and we’d stay here again, just not for the entire time we were on the island."},{"_id":"290106662","date":{"$date":"2018-07-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"578396","reviewer_id":"25412504","reviewer_name":"Anna","comments":"Paulina is lovely and her place has wonderful energy.

The other room was occupied by two Canadian girls, with whom we shared the bathroom. Room was small but clean, and bed was comfortable enough. Shared kitchen looked clean (we did not use it), and shared fridge was clean and very convenient to store food. The lanai was the best part of the shared spaces: it was very nice to spend the evening there having dinner and a glass of wine, watching a movie or chatting with the other guests.  Bathroom is small and the drain of the sink was not working properly. Fresh towels and soap were provided, but no shampoo. It was possible to park for free in fron of the house, but parking was a little crowded with the host's car as well as the other guests' car.  It was ok for one night.

The neighborhood was great - very New York-ish.  Apartment was small, but very neat and tidy and had everything we needed. Kitchen and bathroom were well stocked. Marina was very considerate and provided all things one would need - right now to special band-aids for blisters (which thankfully we did not need!)  Nice plush towels and soaps and shampoos. The bed was comfortable and the bedding was nice. \r\nWe didn't cook while we were there, but there seemed to be pans and anything you would need. Marina provided coffee and tea, which was great. Not having to go out in the morning to get coffee is important. In the evening we would make tea and enjoy our delicious pastries we'd purchase in Little Italy!  \r\nLocation was ideal - walked everywhere - Little Italy, Chinatown were just blocks away. Walked to 9/11 Memorial Museum, Union Square Park, shopping on Broadway - all were a very easy 1 mile walk. Dinner at Emporium just downstairs and it was very good. Also hit the \"famous\" places - Katz's Deli, Lombardi's, pastry from Ferraras Bakery - all were just blocks from the apartment.  The apartment was small, but was perfect for my daughter and myself. Might be a little cramped if you are big or tall and could be crowded for three adults.  The bedroom windows faced the street, so there was so noise from that, but nothing that bothered me or made me lose sleep.

The apartment is small but delightful, was impeccably clean, and had all needed amenities.  We had a very nice stay except for one thing:  the noise.  The bedroom window is just above a bar and, as the weather was nice, there was significant outside revelry until 5 a.m. one night, the other night until about 2.  This was a major problem for us.  I slept on the couch one night as it's further in the apartment and not by the window.  If you plan to use this other wise fabulous place I would encourage bringing ear plugs and considering elsewhere if you are a very light sleeper.  In fairness, NYC is a noisy place, but this was noisier than other locations I've stayed in.

Her apartment was equipped with all the essentials (dishes, coffee maker, hairdryer, etc.) for a long weekend in a great neighborhood. The space was clean and as described/ pictured in her listing. She was kind enough to leave a few snacks and beverages for us to enjoy. The bedroom was spacious with a comfortable queen size bed and plenty of space for clothes in the chest \u0026 wardrobe. There's a fold-out bed available if you have another person, but I didn't use it. The living room is small (as expected in NY), but there's plenty of space to lounge after a long day exploring the city. She has space heaters \u0026 fans for easy temperature control (I loved the heated fan in the bathroom when the temps dropped!) The apartment is in a great area with a ton of delicious restaurants and cute shops within walking distance. There are a couple of subway stations a short walk away too. The neighborhood is quite lively, so if you're a light sleeper, be prepared. Marina offers a noisemaker and earplugs to help with the sound. Everything was great and made for a fun weekend!

Coffee right across the street) away!! Our recommendations: Prince Street Pizza on Prince, Tacombi on Elizabeth, Grey Dog on Mulberry, Rice to Riches on Spring.\nAnd not to forget the WholeFoods on Bowery and Houston.\nSubway as well is only some steps away so you can reach easily all of the city.\n\nYes, you have to climb  1 flight of stairs, and yes, sometimes you can hear the music from 'Emporio' right under the apartment, but that is part of the New York experience, and I wouldn't miss it for a minute.\n\nThanks marina for letting us stay at your place, and we'd love to return!!"},{"_id":"339982457","date":{"$date":"2018-10-22T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5806416","reviewer_id":"52247869","reviewer_name":"Denis","comments":"Terrific location in the heart of Nolita.

Maria was really helpful, sorting out any concerns quickly and without fuss. The apartment is beautiful, and the roof terraces are really useful, we ended up eating there almost every night. We stayed as a group of 10 adults, and while being a little bit cosy at times we all fit in fine, which is certainly an achievement.

Beautiful, well-kept, high end styled home.  Maria could not have been more accommodating.  She met us herself and took us on a tour and showed us how everything worked.  She had a bottle of cava, some snacks and even milk and orange juice in the fridge for us.  How very thoughtful.  She made sure we could get in touch with her if we needed to.  There were many booklets available for our information on things to do and see in Barcelona.  There were lots of towels and blankets and sheets at our disposal.  The apartment is fully equipped to very high standards including wi-fi and has three beautiful terraces plus a big area with clotheslines.  We were 2 couples and 2 single people sharing the apartment and we had plenty of room, even could have had a couple more people with us.  The air conditioning was a great asset for sleeping after a busy day of touring in late August and the elevator went right to our door.  The metro was walking distance away and there were many shops of all kinds in the area. We have only positive comments to make on our stay in Maria’s apartment.  If we ever go back to Barcelona we will not consider staying anywhere else.  If you can rent this lovely apartment you will be very happy there.    \r\n\r\nJosé \u0026 Louise Sanchez and family \r\nMontreal, Quebec, Canada\r\nAugust 2013"},{"_id":"7119522","date":{"$date":"2013-09-07T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"582364","reviewer_id":"7900641","reviewer_name":"Mandy","comments":"Nous étions deux couples et nous avons passés une très bonne semaine dans cet appartement qui correspond très bien au photos qui sont présentées sur l'annonce.

Nous étions un groupe de 7 amis, venus fêter les 30 ans de mon mari. Nous étions 2 couples et 3 personnes seules, ce qui a mon sens est le maximum pour que le confort reste parfait. L'appartement comporte en effet 2 belles suites parentales (chambre + salle de bain), mais le fait qu'il faille traverser ces chambres pour que chacun puisse accéder aux salles de bain est a prendre en compte. Les terrasses sont exceptionnelles, et doivent être un réel bonheur lorsque le temps s'y prête ! La localisation de l'appartement est très agréable, dans un joli quartier résidentiel qui vaut le détour, à proximité du métro direct pour plaça catalunya, avec un accès facile à pieds au parc Guell et pour les plus courageux au centre ville (même sous la pluie !).

The only tiny littles things were that the kitchen was not the same quality as the rest, the DVD player is getting old and unfortunately there was some construction going on in the building at the time we were there.

Nous étions 6 amis et pour la 1ère fois j'avais choisi de louer un appartement au travers d'airbnb. Très belle expérience! J'avais opté pour l'appartement de Maria car il correspondait à nos exigences : un parking, plusieurs chambres à pouvoir utiliser en single ou à 2 et plusieurs salles de bain. L'appartement est splendide, il correspond tout à fait à la description publiée sur le site. Il reflette la personnalité de Maria : accueillant, fonctionnel, très ordonné et très propre. Tout est parfait. On se sent chez soi ou plutôt on a l'impression d'être chez de très bons amis qui mettent à disposition  tout ce qu'ils ont pour vous rendre un séjour agréable. Quant à Maria et à son époux, ils sont vraiment charmants, très disponibles et attentionnés. Ils sont de très bon conseil pour itinéraires, restaurants et tout autre bon plan. Nous avons vraiment beaucoup apprécié leurs conseils. Dernière chose à préciser : l'appartement est dans un quartier calme, avec de superbes terrasses, très proche du métro comme le précise le site et à 2 pas du parc Guell. Puis si l'on préfère se déplacer en taxi (très abordable à Barcelone) en 5, 10  minutes on se retrouve sur la Rambla!

Upon arrival at the apartment we were met by Maria's mother who was extremely welcoming and a lovely lady.  She explained where everything was in the apartment and pointed out the shop on the corner and restaurants. There is a comprehensive amount of information in the apartment about Barcelona. The apartment is very well placed, the metro station within walking distance, direct line into Catalunya.  Parc Guell very close by.  Beautiful views from the solarium and lovely terraces where we ate outside almost every day for breakfast and drinks before going out for dinner.\r\n\r\nAs our flight home was not until late in the evening and check out is at 11 am, Maria's mother took our luggage to the garage and kept it safely in her car which enabled us to have the whole day in Barcelona without our cases. When we returned to pick up the cases Maria's mother insisted on taking us to the airport in her car. We had of course planned on getting a taxi.  Upon arrival at the airport she did not even want any money but we insisted.  How kind was that!   \r\n\r\nWe would all thoroughly recommend Maria's apartment.

Le vis à vis est quasi inexistant et on se sent rapidement chez soi.\nNous étions 4 couples de trentenaires et le nombre de chambres étaient  idéales, avec de l'intimité pour chacun sauf dans la chambre de l'étage qui comporte 2 lits double, le temps d'un week-end end cela ne pose aucun probleme, et cette chambre est parfaite pour un couple avec 2 enfants.\nLes salles de bain sont spacieuses et de belle  factures. La cuisine est fonctionnelle et l'arrière est équipée d'un grand frigo et d'un grand  congélateur. À 20 mètres en bas de la rue, vous trouverez une petite épicerie pratique pour des courses d'appoint et à environ 5/10 min à pieds un petit supermarché Dia. Le centre ville est à 30 min à pieds tout droit vers la mer! Le Parc Guell est juste à côté en montant une bonne côte à pieds, aidé par les escalators. \nTrès satisfait egalement à notre depart, la maman de Maria nous a fixé une heure et elle était ponctuelle.\nNous retenterons l'expérience lors de notre prochain séjour à  Barcelone."},{"_id":"63773620","date":{"$date":"2016-02-27T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"582364","reviewer_id":"44821500","reviewer_name":"Véronique","comments":"L'appartement est bien situé  : rue calme, commerces alimentaires et station de métro à proximité.

Maria's house is in a residential area--it is quiet, and just a 5-10m walk downhill to the Lessups metro station (L3).  It is a 5m walk downhill from the Valcarca station (L3).  It would be a really difficult walk to go up to Valcarca (steep walk uphill).  Francesca was so easy to work with; she received our luggage before check in and showed us how to use the appliances etc.  We did need to use a translator app via our cell phones to communicate but it worked fine.

The two main bedrooms were very comfortable and roomy, with very nice adjoining bathrooms. We ate every meal that we had in the apartment on the terrace outside of the dining area. It had a table that comfortably sat four, and an awning that protected us from the sun. The apartment was in a real neighborhood as opposed to a tourist enclave. There were excellent bakeries, fruit markets, places to buy wine, and a charcuterie within a few blocks. Although we were only one block from a major commercial street, the neighborhood was very quiet. It was a 10-minute ride on the metro to the Plaza Catalunya and Las Ramblas.

Francesca didn't speak much english but it was not a problem at all.  She was delightful showing us the space and making recommendations.  Maria had materials all laid out and offered plenty of brochures to get you going if you didn't have many plans to see the city of Barcelona.  The space was wonderful.  We spend a fair amount of time on the terraces at night and the view was breathtaking.  There was a small problem with the time of checkin (the listing says 3pm on the website but Maria informed us that was a mistake and that it was actually 4pm)  It was not a problem for us and she has made a note to update that for future guests.  It can take about 30 minutes to get to the city center where some attractions are located (Sagrada Familia, Gothic District) but Parc Guell is a 15 minute walk away if you like a workout (it's uphill but there are escalators in some spots).  The house is comfortable, all amenities were available and worked properly and I would highly recommend this home to stay at during your visit to Barcelona."},{"_id":"164860710","date":{"$date":"2017-06-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"582364","reviewer_id":"7709552","reviewer_name":"Bill","comments":"Maria's place is centrally located, can get to most attractions easily in one line of bus or metro (or by foot to Park Guell).

Never did figure out the dishwasher, so some instructions /instructions in English would be great. There is AC except for 1 room upstairs and in the hallway where the fridge is.\n\nSome dishes in the cabinet seemed dirty, so look before you use. Quick fix, just wash them or buy plastic.\n\nI heard from the people who slept in the twin beds in the master bedroom upstairs that they were uncomfortable.\n\nAlso, you will probably need to purchase more toilet paper and paper towels if you have a large group like I did. There is a corner store right down the street.\n\nWe had 7 people with luggage, so when we booked our shuttle it was a large bus. It couldn't make the turn on our street. So be aware when making transportation arrangements. Also, not all companies do pick ups at apartments so you will have to go to the nearest hotel, about a 5 min walk.\n\nAll in all, this was a great apartment. Had everything we needed for our stay.

And you can easily walk up to Park Guell (believe me, the street escalators are an experience, and a bliss). So you can stay here in a very quiet and “real” residential area of the city, and still be conveniently connected to the must-see highlights of the city. By the way, you do have stunning views from the terraces (yes, several), all the way down to the sea.\nThe place is cosy, and the pictures do it justice. Downstairs you have one twin room (access through the kitchen; use the corridor toilet) and one double with a nice en-suite bathroom (with excellent shower; we had some issues with the flush of the toilet). Upstairs there is one single room (though you could put a second be there; very tight, but possible) which has access to the main terrace (from where also the stairs to the top terrace), and then there is the Master bedroom with a double bed and two twin beds (and private terrace and en-suite bathroom with nice bath and correctly-flushing toilet). All beds were really nice and we slept well. So, if this bedding arrangement fits your group, then this is really a nice place to stay.\nThe kitchen is convenient and functional, with the basics when it comes to cutlery and cooking utensils/pots. If you plan to mostly go out to savour the great local kitchen, then this kitchen is more than enough for your breakfasts (including Nespresso machine!); if you plan to cook full meals, you may run into some practical challenges.\nWe really liked our stay, and quickly felt at home. The welcome and local support by Francesca was great (always only an SMS away), and Maria kept communicating so well via AirBnB messaging."},{"_id":"223969632","date":{"$date":"2018-01-02T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"582364","reviewer_id":"117544473","reviewer_name":"Jessica And Rony","comments":"This airbnb was lovely and perfect in size for my family of 8.

I would definitely recommend this airbnb to anyone! The best part that I think isn’t exhibited as much and it should be, is the amazing number of terraces, including the rooftop one with the most magnificent view of Barcelona! \nMy only concern with the location is the steep hills, that may not be suitable for older or disabled people to stay at.

Maria took really good care of us. Also her lovely mother helped us very much. Because my grandparents had trouble walking a lot, she even took them with her private car to the dinner place when we arrived! The view over the city is exceptional as the house is in the north west where the ground level is higher than the rest of the city.

Check-in was simple and went smoothly - we even arrived before 4pm and were able to check in without a problem. The location is excellent - located in a quiet neighborhood away from all the tourists, yet the convenience of the metro makes it easy to get anywhere very quickly. The apartment is beautiful and very cozy. We loved returning every day after our outings, and the layout made it easy for us to relax together as well as retreat to our own areas for privacy. The outdoor spaces are exceptional and all of the bedrooms are very comfortable! The shower in the downstairs en suite bedroom is amazing. The apartment was well-equipped, though we had trouble figuring out how to use the clothes dryer. Also, while there were liquid soap dispensers in each bathroom as well as next to the kitchen sink, it would have been nice to have small bars of soap for the showers. In addition, while the photos were generally an accurate portrayal of the apartment itself, there were minor differences, and we didn't see some of the items shown in the photos (there were no televisions in any of the bedrooms - which was okay since we didn't watch at all; no chaise lounge chairs on the terrace off the living room; no basket of personal care supplies in the bathroom; etc.) These are all minor things, though, and we absolutely loved this apartment.

It has an abundance of terrences to relax in that provide flex space for outdoor meals, mid-afternoon tapas and great views of the city on the rooftop terrace. Both levels have well appointed bathrooms and the extra half bathroom meant that we had lots of flexibility for the four couples that shared this space. The kitchen is well stocked and although we didn't prepare any meals except breakfast it had a full range of cooking options. The washer helped us clean a few things before going home, and the access to the clothes line meant that our clothes was nice a fresh. If it had rained we did have the option of a dryer which we did not need. The beds were generally ok and each guest has a comfy pillow and both a small and large towel. The place was very clean and there is a lot of space to lounge about both inside and out. We were only sorry that we only had two days, we would have loved to stay longer. Very close to Park \nGuell, and the nearby metro made it easy to get around to other locations. There are not a ton of restaurants nearby, but the Inka hamburger place is a resonalby priced options with all kinds of items on the menu (the goat salad was a big hit, althouh I stuck to the hot sandwiches). There are a lot of grocery and food options very near by and we did not lack for great pastries! The check in was easy and the flat itself is on a quaint and relatively quiet street.

It was not one of those all-IKEA furnished places. The apartment has lovely spaces indoor and out. Maria and her mother were very easy to communicate with and very responsive. The location, while not immediately downtown, was convenient to get around and purchase groceries and such locally. Our airline moved up our arrival flight so that we landed very early in the morning and while we couldn't check in until late afternoon due to the prior night being rented, Maria's mom was kind enough to allow us to drop off our luggage and return later. In retrospect, I wish we had booked the night prior so that we wouldn't have had that very long day, but it all worked out. Would definitely consider staying here again if we return to Barcelona."},{"_id":"419593635","date":{"$date":"2019-03-04T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"582364","reviewer_id":"21000107","reviewer_name":"Adam","comments":"Cracking place , location and balconies/terraces! comfortable beds and good bathroom and kitchen facilities, great space all round.

Matt \u0026 Collin were very welcoming when we arrived and always very quick to respond to all messages \u0026 questions we had prior to our trip.  The place is small, but perfect for a couple.  The kitchenette has a stove, but realistically the area is perfect just for use of the small refrigerator/freezer, sink, cups/bowls/plates, \u0026 silverware.  The bedroom has a Full size bed which was very comfortable \u0026 high quality mattress, but we do recommend bringing your own pillows.  The apartment is old (which is part of the charm) however, that can come with its downfalls.  The carpet in the bedroom has seen better days, and the shower head was very awkwardly placed (making showers difficult), but a major bonus was the water pressure \u0026 hot water!  We highly recommend this place.. The price was great for this location/ apartment (especially compared to hotels \u0026 competing AirBNB’s), and we’d definitely stay here again! Hope this was helpful and enjoy your visit to West Village in NYC!!"},{"_id":"358496153","date":{"$date":"2018-12-14T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5850712","reviewer_id":"24822248","reviewer_name":"Ariana","comments":"The apartment exceeded our expectations. The location couldn´t be better, the space itself is very cosy and nice to hang out in.  Also, we really enjoyed the trifecta of heating, warm water with great water pressure and good natural light. The area is very safe and surprisingly quiet at night, within walking distance of a couple of museums and subway lines that will take you all over NYC.  But for sure what made our stay was the amazing hospitality of the host, Matt.  He was there to welcome us and show us around the apartment, the communication was a dream. Take him up on the walk around the block, he will show you a couple of hidden gems. If we´re ever again in NYC, we are hoping to stay there again!"},{"_id":"362947559","date":{"$date":"2018-12-27T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5850712","reviewer_id":"832993","reviewer_name":"Abdul","comments":"Matthew was a great host, very hospitable and attentive.

I went out with Mert and his friends for dinner and coffee and enjoyed this time. He even arranged for me to stay with his brother and family in another city here which was very helpful. This is in Kusadasi(Ephesus). \n\nHe prepared breakfast for me that was delicious with coffee too. There was always water available to drink and anything else that I needed. \n\nHis place was very clean and he offered to wash clothes for me. This was so nice of him. \n\nThe area were he lives is near the sea with incredible views of the islands. It was easy to take transport from here also. \n\nGreat host and new friend! I will be back soon to visit my new friends in this beautiful, peaceful city.

Svarede altid på diverse henvendelser og var utrolig hjælpsom, uanset hvilke spørgsmål jeg havde. Mert gjorde derudover oplevelsen meget nemmere og bedre ved at komme med gode råd, både omkring hvilke ting der kunne være interessante at se, men også i forhold til hvordan man transportere sig nemmere rundt i byen. Det var nemt at komme til lejligheden fra lufthavnen og værten var altid til at få fat på. Sagt med få ord: Mert var en fantastisk og behjælpelig vært!

There are animals everywhere (but not in the house) and if you stay there, you will feel you are truly in the heart of a real farm.

Talk about farm fresh gourmet breakfast, it was amazing. Highly recommend it. The farm is a super laid back working farm staffed by happy young WWOOFERs. (Hidden by Airbnb) them. There is one small down side to this property though. Its noisy. You may want to consider ear plugs if you are a light sleeper.  The night noise are the frogs, the 4am noise are the roosters.  This is in no way a deal breaker, it is just the reality of a farm in Hawaii.  The upside is that you get to hang out on a super cool farm.  We never met Steve and Melinda, they seem to have been away. We were happily attended to by the other farm staff, who were lovely.

Waking up to the crisp magic air in the morning primes your spirit to fully embrace the abundant life and energy the island offers. Steve and Melinda's place is a very grounding environment making it perfect for early morning meditation and yoga. The atmosphere is one that allows you to drop all your mental distractions so you are able to focus on whatever you choose. The different plant and animals on the farm bring you back to a well rounded relationship and help to redevelop respect with not just the earth but the lifeforms we share it with as well. I don't just like the permaculture system they use for their farm, I love the care in which Steve and Melinda have integrated it so that we can experience the great majesty of life on a small scale that is literally easy to digest and compellingly captivating. Wait till you try the dried bananas and Macadamia nut milk they make on the farm. Amazing! Equally amazing are the individuals who staff the farm and the care in which they tend to the duties of such a vibrant existence. It seems that even the other guests are somehow called here to contribute to this farms existence reaching out to say hello to the world with such a welcoming and loving embrace. There are so many good things to mention.

What they are doing, on the Big Island, is so inspiring, and it will stick with me, even after I checked out.  For starters, the location could be hard to find, BUT Steve and Melinda's directions are spot on, and if you follow them, you will not get lost.  Steve was there to greet me when I pulled into their driveway. He gave me a quick tour and overview of the property, and then set me off to go play with BABY SHEEP and BABY GOATS!  Cuteness overload!  This, of course, was not required of guests, but I was dying to hold the baby animals.  ;)  The fresh macadamia nuts and the postcard-like sunsets from the lanai added to the perfection of this listing.  If you ever stay here, be sure to use the outdoor shower as it as pure magic.  I highly recommend Steve and Melinda's farm for anyone who wants to experience the non-high rise resort side of Hawaii.

What a stunning place to visit. Before you even enter the house the property is packed with lush vegetation, flowers, fruit, herbs, trees and shrubs, decorated so thoughtfully with an eclectic grouping of statues, pots, shells and comfortable furniture to lounge in.... AND THE VIEW ahhhh it will take your breath away! Make sure to wander the grounds to get a full appreciation for what they have done here, and to play with all the wonderful animals meandering the property: ducks, chickens, rabbits, sheep, cats and the sweetest little old dog you've ever met. CAT ALLERGIES?  Not to worry. My husband has horrible cat allergies and the cats are NEVER allowed in the guest quarters, but do be aware that they are all over the lanai, and if you have allergies I to probably stay clear of any outside upholstery.. but seriously my husband never had a problem.\r\n\r\nThe guest house is just fantastic!!!! Two guest bedrooms, one with a private bath the other with a shared bath. A beautiful well stocked kitchen and comfortable dining and living room area for lounging, do be considerate about using  your hosts kitchen products - this is their private home so if you are doing cooking (beside spices set aside for your use) make sure to bring your own food. They did have coffee \u0026 farm fresh eggs available for purchase. Our room was thoughtfully decorated and VERY comfortable and VERY private... we really didn't want to leave. We also highly recommend using the outdoor shower, it's clean, private with beautiful views of the property - it takes a minute for the hot water to get running but once it is works like a dream. I'm a big outdoor shower fan.. and didn't once take a shower indoors\r\n\r\nMelinda is also a very skilled massage therapist. My husband and I booked a 90 min massage each and did not regret a minute of it. I recommend you take advantage of her skills during your stay.\r\n\r\nWe plan on returning again and staying with Steve and Melinda - and probably for a lot longer next time."},{"_id":"4382092","date":{"$date":"2013-05-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"59066","reviewer_id":"3930786","reviewer_name":"Lanner","comments":"Great farm airbnb.

We didn't get to meet Melinda but Steve was  an awesome nice guy who runs an Eco farm and small B\u0026B.   The house was good size, very clean and felt like a home.  Have to admit we got lucky cuz nobody else was there so we had the whole house to ourselves!  Our favorite parts was the outdoor shower,  beautiful large lanai \u0026 seclusion.  So, if you don't need the pampering resort or five star hotel feel this place is definitely for u!

The hosts are dedicated to the health of the land, people and whole community around Honaunau, and it really shows.  Also, the location can't be beat.  It is near bunch of good restaurants, close to some of the best swimming and snorkeling on the Big Island, and just up the hill from important Hawaiian cultural sights and heiau.

You can be as involved as you like in farm activities and classes, or not, as you choose.  The property was wonderful to walk, the house is excellent with great views.  Nicely equipped kitchen - though bring your own spices. The pictures don't do it justice.  It was great to watch fantastic sunsets from the spacious covered deck.  The cool mountain breezes were wonderful for sleeping at night.  \r\n\r\nIt is the perfect spot for access to some of the best sites south of Kona. You are 10 minutes to two of the most fantastic and special places on the island: Two Step beach is next to the second most sacred ancient Hawaiian site, The Place of Refuge, or Pu'uhonua o Honaunau and the bay there is great snorkeling with very good reef life and healthy coral.  It is next to Kalekekua Bay which is a marine reserve, you will need to read up on access, but snorkel or kayak tours, or kayaking on your own are well worth it.   Both bays are where Spinner Dolphins often come to sleep during the day.  If you snorkel at Two Step and find the Dolphins, please let them decide to interact, respect their need for rest after hunting all night.  It is a magical experience to be chosen by a dolphin for interaction, but do not pursue them.  \r\n\r\nHonaunau is 90 minutes from Volcano National park and is also an easy drive into Kailua-Kona.  I highly recommend this wonderful sanctuary.

The kitchen was well equipped, and our last morning there Emily made us a breakfast that was amazing (had I realized how great it was going to be I would have had it every morning). She gathered fresh food from the garden and made sunny side up eggs, chard and mushrooms, purple sweet potatoes and red potatoes, avocados, fresh tangerine juice, star fruit, bananas, and a fresh mint tea. The views from the Lanai are wonderful: tropical forests, the bay, and sunset. The afternoon sun hits the porch.

We chose this unit without knowing too much about Princeville or the North Shore. However, we were so happy when we landed. Princeville, while lacking in charm/character, is beautiful and quite close to Hanalei which we spent a lot of time in. There are also beautiful beaches close by which are a bit more secluded compared to the tourist packed ones.  There were lots of conveniences close by so that was handy too.\r\n\r\nThe unit itself was actually nicer and larger than we thought it was going to be. The lanai was really big too. And like others have said the bed was sooo comfortable. We met Christine briefly during our check-in which was actually a chance encounter as she had mistakenly let another couple into our unit thinking it was us! This was resolved quickly and without issue, but had we arrived later that evening it might have been a problem, as she had emailed us a new code for the lock box and not having a travel plan on my phone I did not get the new code before arriving. We could have arrived late at night, with no access to the lock box and someone else in our unit! Alas, that did not happen.  The phone was not working while we were there which was an inconvenience for us in trying to confirm some things locally.  I emailed Christine to inform her, she said she would look into it but we never heard back, nor did it get fixed during our stay.  Also, a family moved into the until next door during a couple evenings of our stay, who chose to watch movies loudly with all their doors open.  It was essentially like being in a movie theater in our room.  This combined with the sounds from other families/people in the units, makes for a bit of a noisy stay, albeit not all the time.  The one thing we were wishing for though was air conditioning.  We knew the unit did not have any going in, but it was soooo hot.  The fan did nothing to cool things down, so really we did not spend too much time in the room other than to sleep, when it did cool down a bit.\r\n\r\nAlthough we weren't 100% satisfied, for the price per night, this unit was overall a good deal.  We couldn't find anything even close to this price for the space/location. Think about the importance of quiet and coolness before you book, and if they are not must-haves for you, I would say this will be a great space!"},{"_id":"19669089","date":{"$date":"2014-09-16T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"591106","reviewer_id":"13459848","reviewer_name":"Shannon","comments":"Very nice property, especially the pool and hot tub.

Although Catherine's communication was good leading up to our trip, our stay got off to a rocky start when we tried unsuccessfully to access the lock box on the front door with the code she had provided. Initially unable to reach Catherine by phone or text, we stood outside the complex with growing concern, but she eventually returned our call and provided us with the appropriate code. \r\n\r\nOnce inside, we could not find the 'local phone' that was advertised in the condo description, but all of the other amenities were as described. The bed was quite comfortable, although the top sheet smelled as if it had not been cleaned recently. The walls were also very thin, so we could hear conversations and television programs from our neighbouring units.\r\n\r\nOverall, Catherine's studio apartment in Princeville was a reasonably priced and decent place to stay for a couple of nights. With so much beauty in the nearby north shore of Kauai, these minor issues did not affect the enjoyment inherent in our overall trip.

Cozy, comfortable, nice patio, it definitely met our needs.\r\n\r\nPerfect location in Priceville, close to the north shore (where you want to be), very close to Hanalei (food, shops, kayaking, everything). Beaches within a 5 minute drive (Hideaways, Queen's Bath,  Sealodge Beach).\r\n\r\nOnly knock is that it was unseasonably hot in Kauai (a little over 90) during our visit. Way uncomfortable hot really. The fan helped a little, but still, it was too hot to sleep most nights. Most places here don't have A/C, so we didn't anticipate having it, but you might want to pick up an extra fan if it's super hot when you visit (not common).\r\n\r\nNice amenities, like beach towels, MP3 clock for music, beach chairs, a little cooler for your use. We spent 11 nights and found parking in the complex 10 of them. Great pool, hot tub, and BBQ area. Grocery store within a 5 minute drive (albeit an expensive one).\r\n\r\nThis is a great unit if you're on a budget, and not too particular. A few little awkward things like washing dishes in the bathroom sink, but so minor compared to the splendor of the area. Be aware that you're in a beautiful humid area, so you might find a cockroach or gecko running around inside. It really isn't a big deal. Let it back out. But I know that bothers some people (hotels have them too).\r\n\r\nHighly recommended!"},{"_id":"47348712","date":{"$date":"2015-09-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"591106","reviewer_id":"33751753","reviewer_name":"Thomas","comments":"When we arrived in the late evening, the appartement wasn't cleaned by the responsible company.

It is perfect amount of space for 1-2 people. It comes equipped with a fridge, toaster oven, microwave, coffee maker, utensils, plates, etc. To be honest, we didn't linger or hang out much in the unit since there is simply too much to do and see in Kauai, so the unit was perfect to rest your head. The bed was SO COMFORTABLE. I slept like a log every night. I was concerned about the directions to the unit, since another reviewer wrote their GPS didn't work and it was dark out. My phone's GPS worked fine, but I printed directions just to be safe. The street signs in Kauai are hard to see as they are usually several feet before the actual street, so I relied heavily on the GPS for the first day or two until I got my bearings. So, bring a car charger if you plan to rent a car and print directions just to make sure you can get there.\r\n\r\nThe location was ideal too--it was situated in the middle of the North Shore and about 15 minutes to Kilauea, and 30 minutes to Kapaa. As a bonus, the residence is only 1 mile from the Queens Bath, which is absolutely worth the venture. You could walk there since parking is rough, and you have to hike downhill about 0.6 miles to the actual bath. \r\n\r\nI had no issues or complaints and would definitely recommend this accommodation."},{"_id":"72450159","date":{"$date":"2016-05-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"591106","reviewer_id":"15876216","reviewer_name":"Liz","comments":"Nice central location with easy parking and logistics (checking in/out, getting the key, etc.).

It was very clean, great linens, filled with everything you need for the beach and close to everything. I travel to Princeville once a year and this truly was a gem. It was quiet and easy. Bed extremely comfortable. \r\nCathrine got back to me in a reasonable time frame, but was all business. A bit to impersonal for my taste, but she was good about communication. The place is exactly as described, I would say even better. No complaints other than the vent for the dryer at the next door unit blows directly onto the lani. So sitting on the lani I got hit with the heat when the dryer was on. Outside of that the place was perfect. Thank you Cathrine, I truly enjoyed your place and look forward to coming back again next year.

Catherine gave us a partial refund, but the stay ended up being quite expensive as the cleaning fee and Airbnb fee were not adjusted. We also noted some concerns with cleanliness  and condition that should be addressed and make this unit less appealing than other available Airbnb listings.\r\n\r\nProblem areas:\r\nBeach chairs rusty and completely covered in sand upon arrival. Dining seat cushions stained and discolored. The ceiling fan makes an irregular metallic clicking sound that is loud enough to be disruptive to sleep, but given the lack of air conditioning needs to be used to make the space comfortable. The blinds don't go down sufficiently to block the front windows and the curtains aren't sufficiently wide to cover the patio door. SHARED INTERIOR DOOR with the adjoining unit is a huge noise/privacy problem. We found several cockroaches in the apartment (likely due to close proximity to the dumpsters). The area surrounding the shower is badly in need of cleaning -- very dusty and grimy. Crusty stain (semen?) on the duvet cover. -Even small things like the laminated sheet with directions needed a wipe down or just replacement (outdated info, just print a new one).\r\n\r\nThe good:\r\nComfortable bed. Location. Ease of check-in.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the $62 cleaning fee is going toward, but it doesn't appear to be particularly effectively spent. I'm appreciative of the partial refund for the canceled portion of our stay, but I am somewhat incensed that our one night ended up being so expensive -- and in fact, our most expensive night of our vacation, when it fell so short of even basic levels of cleanliness, privacy and comfort. I'm still dissatisfied with amount of refund we received and believe more effort should have been made to make things right, including at least a partial refund of the cleaning fee given the lack of cleanliness when we arrived. There needs to be some attention paid to this apparently neglected unit. It has potential to be a good listing again, but it's not there now."},{"_id":"108892491","date":{"$date":"2016-10-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"591106","reviewer_id":"21229741","reviewer_name":"Cary Anne And Spencer","comments":"The room was exactly as described in the listing.

If the property isn't full, this likely isn't an issue. During my stay the property was very full, and since the unit doesn't have a reserved parking spot, one must utilize a visitor parking space. There are only so many visitor parking spots, and once they fill up folks can make up a few more spots under trees, on the grass, or around medians, but even those vanish after a while. After that, I don't know where one could park without worrying about being towed. As such, I felt like I had a curfew during the say and was constantly nervous when out at night that no spot would be available when I got back to the property.\n\nThe minor problem was related; the wireless Internet in the unit was VERY slow. Much too slow to stream anything, so since I was stuck in the unit fairly early at night, it got a little boring.

I am not sure if it would be suitable if you are planning to spend a lot of time in the room.  The only big issue we had, as others noted, was that parking was very difficult to find at night.  Both nights of our stay we came back (around 8 or 9) to find that all the unmarked spots were taken and ended up driving back and forth between the two parking lots for 20 minutes waiting for someone to leave.  One of the nights we ended up parking on the grass because nothing opened up.  A very frustrating way to end the day, especially when parking is a listed amenity.

Its location is great and it's clean and comfortable. We didn't have a problem not having A/C but we were there in October and it wasn't that hot. The bed is super comfortable and the lanai is great for hanging out (a sofa here would be a huge plus!). We could do surprisingly much with only a toaster oven but a few more utensils would make life easier when cooking in such a limited space. The bathroom sink is also where you do the dishes but that wasn't really a problem. The one thing is that it's quite noisy. We could hear the next door neighbors as if they were in the room with us and even people who were farther still seemed as if they were in the next room. This did make it difficult for us to sleep and it even woke us up in the middle of the night; if you're a heavy-sleeper you'll be fine, if not, bring earplugs! Overall we enjoyed our stay, Kauai is small enough that you get to the farthest point in ~2 hours but the Northshore is beautiful and full of things to do!"},{"_id":"210932631","date":{"$date":"2017-11-11T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"591106","reviewer_id":"35962268","reviewer_name":"Kathy","comments":"Great, affordable place to stay in princeville.

There's no AC (many places don't have AC on the island) but sleeping at night, even in the summer, was just fine with a fan and ceiling fan. It gets below 70 most nights on the island. The room was private and quiet, with ample parking.\n\nThe pool and hot tub were very nice and never crowded. Catherine's place is also less than a thirty minute walk from queen's bath (highly recommended!), which is convenient since you have to drive everywhere in Kauai, and there's usually a 45+ minute, cutthroat, car line waiting to park in one of the few spots at queen's bath. It's also close to kayaking, snorkeling, cozy beach towns, some amazing beaches, and an airport that does helicopter tours. It's also less than an hour drive to Wailua, where there's many scenic things to see.\n\nBe aware that in 2018, until at least (estimated) September, basically anything west of Hanalei Bay is closed except to locals only due to the historic flood damage that has affected much of the island. The whole island is still open for tourism (trust me, you should still go), and there's still plenty to do on the north shore alone, but some beaches and hiking (like the Kalalau Trail) are not accessible.\n\nAlso as there is no road going through the middle of Kauai.

The residential object looks new and clean, there is a pool and jacuzzi available. The neighborhood is lovely. Overall I rated this accommodation with 4 stars for 2 reasons: \n1. The apartment was not build as a separate apartment (it is one big apartment separated by doors and wardrobe), so we can heart every single word of the family staying in the second part of the apartment (5AM - TV, shower, talking). \n2. We do not see Catherine, she was just send us a password for the key. Did not ask if we need anything, no tips for Kauai. I get only one message from her and it was answer on my question when the apartment will be ready. \nAnyway I can recommended this place if you are ok with noise from next door apartment and impersonal communication."},{"_id":"366547751","date":{"$date":"2019-01-02T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"591106","reviewer_id":"103731809","reviewer_name":"Kara","comments":"Great location that is close to town and local sites.

The value is very good as well. However, because the metal shutters do not close entirely, you are left with the choice of whistling wind throughout the night, or the open shutter with wind whipping through causing the front door to rattle. We ended up putting a chair up against the door which stopped the rattling. Overall, a nice area for a pleasant stay with everything you could need assuming you aren’t planning on cooking."}]}

Within steps of this apartment are countless good restaurants, many moderately priced by Sydney standards.  If you plan to do some of your own cooking, there are decent markets within walking distance.  While the apartment is not located in the main tourist areas, they are readily accessible by public transportation.\n\nFinally, Narelle is a superb host.

Having the washing machine and drying racks for laundry is especially helpful for the compact traveller who doesn't bring much but does have to wash clothing often enough.

It's just the kind of place that we would want to stay if we were visiting New York! We enjoy meeting interesting, creative and passionate people from around the world and sharing our love of Brooklyn and New York City with them -- the history, food, art, architecture, and music. What we offer is a room in a beautiful house. We are relaxed and welcoming. We ask that our guests make themselves at home (and we do all we can to make them as comfortable as possible). Staying with us is like staying with friends or family (who can cook well). We do not have locks on room doors (although we do fully respect our guest's privacy). This is not a hotel or a bed and breakfast \"business\" (no teddy bears or pot pourri). It is sometimes elegant and sometimes casual. We like vintage furniture, street art, local food, and all kinds of music ...  an urban sensibility. It's 'real life' in this house -- we have dogs who are enthusiastic greeters, teenagers who are in and out and friends who stop by. That said, we try really hard to make each guest's stay wonderfully memorable. Please read our reviews.

Every room we saw had little treasures to uncover and corners to explore, it was truly a remarkable experience.

However, it would be all too easy to place all our accolades exclusively upon the stunning grandeur of this historical and beautifully renovated brownstone. Yes, the place is gorgeous and all the fine details of how so many individual pieces of the home came together in the renovation (as told to us by Jessica and Doug) were endlessly fascinating to hear about and see up close; the ride up to our bedroom floor in one of the oldest operating Otis elevators in New York, being but one of the many cool highlights of our time spent here. But put all of that aside, and you still should want to book one of the rooms at The Notorious B.N.B if only to experience the hospitality of Jessica and Doug. They are truly hosts who have earned their \"Superhost\" status by not only offering guests an amazing place to stay, but in topping it all off with fantastic service, wonderful breakfasts, and genuine warmth and hospitality that exceeds any expectations one might hold for even a 5-star hotel. As \"Superhosts\" ourselves with more than 270+ reviews to our own name, we left here with the convictions that (a) we will most definitely be back for a longer stay in The Notorious as soon as possible and (b) we need to kick it up quite a few more notches in our own hosting duties back home, if we are ever to consider ourselves in the same league as Jessica and Doug. Just book it.

Our room was clean and comfortable and had many little added amenities that were both thoughtful and practical.  The area felt very safe and was walking distance to some lovely shops and cafes.  The subway was right outside their door practically which made navigating the city quite easy.  We appreciated the extra efforts they made to connect with us and let us feel like we belonged and were not intruding.  Their home has an interesting history and is grand without being pretentious!  I liked not having a TV in the room, it helped create time to relish the moments.  The elevator was super cool and the art; avant garde,  The dogs added some character and fun... plus they are getting a girl puppy soon so that will create even more excitement.  I had always dreamed of staying in a Brownstone in Brooklyn while visiting New York City, and quite frankly, this was perfection.... completely dreamy and wonderful.

It'd be easy to get jaded from running a busy, successful b\u0026b with a constant barrage of tourists coming and going, but J\u0026D have mastered the fine art of hospitality, being friendly and helpful without being intrusive.  We came back from a family affair on our second evening to find a small outdoor gathering of J\u0026D's friends and much to our delight, J\u0026D invited us to join them and then proceeded to introduce us to some of their very interesting friends and neighbors....plus they shared dinner, dessert and wine with us.  A few nights later, they invited us to watch the democratic debate on TV with them.    This is very different from the faceless anonymity of most lodging situations and imbued our four night visit to Brooklyn with a sense of temporary, welcoming community. Breakfasts were simple (but  ample and delicious) continental with fresh, warm bread, strawberries, blueberries and homemade muffins and biscuits -- shared with other interesting, international travelers.  We had driven our car to Brooklyn, loaded with two bikes and appreciated that the parking was secure and without added costs.  Over the four days of our visit, we biked every day - Central Park, across the Brooklyn Bridge to Manhattan and the High Line, to Brooklyn Botanical Gardens (free on Tuesday AM) and to the Brooklyn Grange rooftop farm.  Biking is a great way to see NYC!  The area around the Notorious BnB has tons of interesting restaurants that are within easy walking distance.   All in all, this is a great base for touring NYC and is highly recommended.

I can't recommend this as a stay more. The beautiful, gorgeously renovated, large home was a block and a half from the G line subway which was an easy 3 minute walk. The room we had was large with huge windows overlooking a tree lined street and had its own attached modern en suite bathroom with a bonus treat of art on the walls. There is a lift to help with those heavy cases. The 2 dogs were welcoming and enthusiastic about becoming friends! Jessica made us a lovely breakfast made all the more delicious by her exquisite selection of hand made and designer mugs and napkins etc. We sat and talked over breakfast about New York, about art and music, about the history of this building. I'm rather looking forward to staying here again one day and perhaps organizing a dinner banquet for New York friends on that 26 seater dinning table. The only negative i can think of is that the G subway line crosses Brooklyn and doesn't connect to Manhattan but a switch to the L line is easy at the Metropolitan station. The place cost slightly more than my initial budget but is totally worth it and I'm so glad we just went with it. I'm sorry we didn't get to meet Doug. Thank you Jessica for the perfect stay for us to end our New York trip with. I do hope we meet again someday.

But despite this level of design, it still felt like we could be comfortable and at home there. My friends and I were tempted to even just spend the night in because we loved the comfort of our rooms so much. \n\nI can’t wait to stay here again. \n\nP.S.

I'm from Philly so I dig the \"hood\" if it were. That means bodegas opened late and a lot more people watching...which I love. I stayed for the AP musical fest so it being within walking distance of the park which was a major perk. The neighbors were hella friendly, and I was pleasantly surprised at how chill the area was with parking and the noise being basically nil. The photos are true to the apt and it's a good size for two people for sure. The only other thing I would suggest is getting a mini tv for the living area but with fast wifi and my own personal tablet I was able to watch my weekend shows undisturbed.

If you’re okay with walking a few minutes to the next subway station (which I perfectly was), then the location of the appartement is really okay. If not: There’s also a citibike station and I think also a bus-station nearby. I think for New York City this neighbourhood is rather quiet (traffic and neighbours).

But beware that the room is extremely cold during the winter since there is no installed heater. So we would recommend it only in the summer. \n\nSteve is a great host. He is mostly gone but always answers texts within minutes. \n\nThe neighborhood is ok, but we (2 Girls) felt a little unsafe sometimes, just because there is a liquor store right around the corner and there are always some people sitting there, trying to talk to you. \n\nBeware that you will have to walk around 15 minutes to get to the closest Metro Station. Same is with supermarkets. But the walk is not too bad in the mornings, but once you get home at night after a long day it can be annoying. \n\nThe bed is quit small for two friends but comfy. \n\nOver all we can recommend Steve’s accommodation but only if you are aware of the facts above so that you know what you are getting."}]}

Her place (street level) is located in a neighbourhood I like very much (Poble Sec), close by a subway station. The room was very much like the description provided on the listing. Everything was clean and tidy. The room fits one person and has plenty of storage. It does not have any window and is located in between the kitchen and another bedroom: it is therefore extremely quite, which I really appreciated given my sleeping pattern during this short trip (6am-12pm). I was unfortunate enough to fall in her shower and break the plastic frame, also getting mildly injured in the process. Inma was considerate in helping me clean the injury and we settled the damage by splitting repair fees.

The building is also dated and Hawaii has a moderate to hot tropical climate making roaches and other bugs unavoidable.  I have the inside of our unit professionally sprayed for roaches/bugs quarterly and we keep no food in the unit to try to avoid attracting them.  This building was built in the 1960's, and has some electrical issues. We have recently discovered our electrical system in the kitchen and bathroom are on the same circuit breaker. IF A TENANT IS USING APPLIANCES IN THE KITCHEN AND A BLOW DRYER IS TURNED ON IN THE BATHROOM OR MULTIPLE APPLIANCES, IT WILL TRIP THE CIRCUIT BREAKER.  If this happens call the front desk for 24 HOUR assistance. TO AVOID THIS HAPPENING WE RECOMMEND that you NOT use the stove, coffee pot, or microwave if you are going to use a blow dryer in the bathroom or run multip","transit":"\"The Bus\" is the local bus line that is located very close to the unit, download the app to make the route navigation super easy! There's also moped and bike rental on the side street to the hotel and plenty of taxi and rental car establishments.

We also recommend using Biki Bikes, UBER or LYFT for getting around in town.","access":"The studio is located in the Waikiki Grand Hotel and guests have access to all of the amenities the building has to offer from the pool to the observation deck!  The building is referred to as a condo-tel because it has a mixture of owner occupied units, vacation rental units, and hotel rooms.  You will be able to make yourself at home with everything at your fingertips! The building has a pool, rooftop observation deck, laundry room with ice and vending machines, Hulu's open air bar, and Teddy's Burgers.  Parking: Parking can be reserved on a first come/first serve basis by calling the Waikiki Grand Hotel front desk at ((PHONE NUMBER HIDDEN), their rate is $17/dy.  There is limited street parking.

The galley kitchen is so ideal, as you'll be able to pick up some groceries rather than having to eat out all the time. Kitchen items fully stocked. Excellent organization for a \"city\" size unit.

It is obvious from the conversation that he has done well for himself financially even though he does not flaunt it at all. The conversation goes in several different ways all surrounding finance; politics and fiscal policy, trust funds, college education costs, insurance captives etc etc.  I love it!  I am in Hawaii from the Midwest and the weather is perfect and I am overlooking the ocean! I find out he travels to Hawaii regularly since his Daughter moved to the island.  His best advice for visiting Hawaii (Oahu)?? Stay at the hotel right down there and walk to everything since it is in the perfect location.  Well what do you know?  He was talking about staying in Judith's building!!  I proudly stuck my chest out and remarked \"That's where we are staying!\" \r\n\r\nThe moral of that story?  This unit is in the perfect location!! \r\n\r\nThis was my first time on AirBnB and my first time in Hawaii so it was a real risk to stay here.  But the Lord lead me correctly. We were 1/2 block from the beach and the busiest street in Oahu. \r\n\r\nThe room was cozy and clean and Judith was more helpful than a Hotel concierge.  She emailed us in advance about some of the best places to eat and go and we took her suggestions on many of them and were not disappointed. The room was also stocked with extra stuff like a mat for the beach which we used when we went to the North Shore. We ate breakfast in the room daily and then we hit the road.\r\n\r\nIf you are looking to lounge poolside or sit in your bed the entire trip and gaze out of the window then this is not the place for you since the view is not great and the pool has no real view. \r\n\r\nIf you are like us and want to actually SEE Hawaii then save money on accommodations and actually go DO stuff!!  We went Para-sailing, on a Helicopter flight around the island, Stand Up Paddle Boarding, to a Luau, on a Catamaran Trip, a 2 hour hike up some mountain (Kuholuo Trail?), rode in a regular paddle boat, attended the swap meet and Aloha Stadium for great cheap gifts had dinner at sunset at a revolving restaurant and saw the Sunset dip into the ocean on the North Shore plus other stuff.\r\n\r\nJudith and this place were awesome.

She contacted prior to my arrival to give some details and the door code I stayed by myself, but the unit would also be great for 2. The unit was clean modern looking and for the most part had all of the accessories for a rental to eat, clean, ect. \r\n\r\nJudith would check up on me via text through out my stay to ask if there was anything I needed. \r\n\r\nI went to Costco near my home put the food plastic bags, checked it with my luggage and  loaded the fridge. This was a great option for me because of the convenience and it  both saved money on eating out.\r\n\r\nThe  Beach a stones throw away from the building.\r\n\r\nThere was also bar on the second floor of the building, where I met some really nice people from all over the world.  I met a local girl at the bar  who  invited and took me  to a local bbq a few days later, where I also met some great people. One day the bar also had this singer  who could of been a professional. \r\n\r\nI met some Aussie girls at the bus stop near bye, who invited me to a local bar with them  and even took me out to dinner a couple days later for my birthday.\r\n\r\nI will definitely come back one day and I will hopefully be able to get the same unit again.  I went to Hawaii without a plan and not knowing anyone and made some great friends and memories.  I do not think half of the random fun experiences I had would of happened if I had not stayed there.

There was also aloe gel, etc left from previous renters which were nice little bonuses. Parking is now $17 dollars, not $15.  The ac and fan worked really well, we have stayed in Hawaii before with no ac and won't do that again. The unit was super clean and honestly seemed bigger than the photos.

Judith organised an early checkin for us after a long flight and responded quickly to a couple of messages we sent. \nThere is however one significant negative; the hotel's air conditioning plant is directly below #505's small balcony and the noise meant we never spent more than a minute or two on the balcony.  Even with the balcony door closed the roar from the A/c below was quite intrusive.   Of course this is obviously beyond Judith's control.

Here is our full review:\r\n\r\nLet me start by saying that we are the kind of vacationers that just needs a decent place to shower and sleep in at night. We spend 90% of our day outside of the room.\r\n\r\nHost: We never met Judith, but she was very responsive and nice. We forgot our Hawaiian chocolate presents in the freezer, and she shipped it to us to Washington DC! THANK YOU SO MUCH.\r\n\r\nPros: \r\n- Location, Location, Location! It is right in front of the zoo at the end of the Waikiki area/beach, which means less tourists and traffic. It takes about 10-15mins walking to be in the center of Waikiki beach, and 2mins driving to get on the highway. In my opinion, this was the perfect spot to be in if you are planning on seeing the entire island. Easy to jump locations and still be in heart of the city.\r\n- Parking in the hotel was easy and not that expensive. Highly recommend getting parking in the building garage. It will save you lots of time.\r\n- You get lots of towels, fast free wifi (check the back of the router for info to connect), AC, and electronic door lock (no need to carry room keys around).\r\n- The bed and pillows were comfortable.\r\n\r\nCons: \r\n- Can't turn on the electric stove and AC or Fan at the same time. You will lose electricity right away, then you need to contact the front desk, so they can contact the building engineer. Depending on the engineer's schedule/location, you could sit in the dark for more than 30mins.\r\n- The building is old + wood kitchen cabinets + beach area = few cockroaches! Highly recommend washing everything you use in the kitchen.\r\n- Room size. The room looked a little bigger in the picture. There is about a foot between the kitchen area/wall and bed. Hardly any space to open your luggage, the fridge, or hang your clothes.\r\n\r\nOverall, we had a great stay for the price and the host was very nice. I would not recommend this for family stay, honeymooners or groups more than 2 people. It's just too small. I recommend it for people who will hardly be in the room all day in a great location to be in."},{"_id":"68866773","date":{"$date":"2016-04-07T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5960384","reviewer_id":"43623815","reviewer_name":"Chrissy","comments":"Cute place which was perfect for our stay.

The sundeck is great for sunrises and sunsets, the views are to die for. The room was good for us as we were out most of the time and we did utilise the kitchen for breakfasts. If you are looking for space, then you may need to look elsewhere. In relation to the air con noise, it wasn't bad as some reviewers have mentioned.

So close to the beach, restaurants, bars, and a central location for driving all over the island. Starbucks and the ABC store are right outside the hotel which was great. \n-Parking- $17 a day was a deal for right on Waikiki and we used our car every day. \n-Clean, well decorated \n-Provided beach towels and boogie boards \n-10th floor deck had beautiful views of Waikiki and diamond head. Better in the morning because sunset is not really visible from the deck but it's easy to walk down to the beach for sunset. There is a patio but the view is of the AC Unit so we ended up on the deck every day. \n-Wifi and cable worked well. \n-Nice to have the kitchenette although we didn't really end up using it. \n\nCons-\n-Mattress was pretty terrible. There were large dips on each side of the mattress and hard to get a good nights sleep. Also seemed like the mattress was slanted and felt like I was falling off every morning. If it wasn't for this the stay would have been great. \n-There is a pool at the hotel, but it was pretty green and not too tempting to take a dip in.  But the beach is right across the street and that's really what you are there for. \n-I think the neighbors have pet birds. We heard A LOT of bird noises. \n-Although snorkeling gear was provided, most of it was broken.

Considering how busy the place is there isn't really too much noise and there is just a great atmosphere all round.

We had several electrical outages during our stay.  After attempting to reach Judith via two emails, text, and also voicemail, she finally got back to me after several hours in which she replied, \"It was out of her control,\" and to try using less power.  She admitted that it had previously been a problem with other guests and must be because of the renovations they were doing in the building. That is something I feel should have been disclosed in the listing because knowing that the electricity could go out would have affected my decision to stay there.  \r\n\r\nThroughout our stay, the electricity shut off repeatedly whenever we used the blow dryer, microwave, etc. and because the electrical circuits were connected to others in the building the electricity could go out when others used too much power so it was completely out of our control.  We were scared to watch TV, use the microwave, or anything of the sort because we were afraid the power would cut out.\r\n\r\nThere was a ton of noise in the building and we were awoken many nights by people yelling in the halls, fire alarms going off in the wee hours of the morning (happened twice).  Also, the ceiling light would mysteriously turn on several times during the night so we would get woken up by a bright light shining right in our faces.\r\n\r\nHonestly, it was one of the worst places we've ever stayed and certainly the worst Airbnb place we've stayed at.  I feel like she was dishonest in not telling people upfront about the electrical problems that she was aware of and that other guests had experienced these issues."},{"_id":"107631988","date":{"$date":"2016-10-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5960384","reviewer_id":"78314297","reviewer_name":"Ann-Kristin","comments":"Wir waren rundum zufrieden.

My friends and I booked our trip when we found out BIGBANG would be performing a fanmeet/concert in Honolulu. With that being said, we spent almost all our money on the resale concert tickets and had very little left over for a room. \r\n\r\nJudith's place was the solution to all of our problems. Not only was it super affordable, it was clean and comfortable. Although the room is in an older building, everything else about it is very new and clean (which is the number 1 thing I'm looking for when I'm booking a room). I loved that Judith made sure to get us the code to get into the room early (before we even arrived in Hawaii). We didn't even need to ask/remind her that we'd be there soon. She made it so there was ZERO stress getting into the room after a long flight to get some rest. She also checked in on us halfway through our visit to make sure everything was going well, which we also really appreciated/weren't expecting. Judith provided some shampoos, lotions, etc, which was super nice of her because we had nothing when we got to the room but were too tired to go shopping right away. \r\n\r\nThe room also had a little kitchenette, which we thought we would use but actually didn't touch at all. The food in Hawaii was so awesome that we ate out at least three meals a day. However, Judith supplies everything you would need in case you do want to cook. She also provided an umbrella and rain ponchos, which we didn't even think about before we got to Hawaii, but we were super appreciative of after we got there. We also ended up using her beach towels in addition to our own, alternating. \r\n\r\nOtherwise, we barely spent any time in the hotel room. We were only there for sleeping. We paid for parking through the hotel (which was $17/day). In hindsight, we shouldn't have done that because we were so rarely at the hotel. Our car was only parked for the 7-8 hours that we were sleeping, so we would have saved money if we parked across the street at the zoo ($1/hour). With that being said, it was sort of nice to have the car just downstairs so we could get going as soon as possible.

One advice I can give is if you do rent a car and park at the Grand Waikiki, ideally rent a compact car. As Judith mentions in her description (clearly I did not read it fully) the garage is tight and you go down/come up a fairly steep slope. We rented a mustang and it was tight. Great experience for the start of our honeymoon, we would definitely stay there again!"},{"_id":"162902868","date":{"$date":"2017-06-22T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5960384","reviewer_id":"130817859","reviewer_name":"Dawn","comments":"We took the \"Speedy\" shuttle from the airport $15/person.

We were so excited to get to Hawaii, we had always wanted to go and it finally happened. After arriving to the hotel with our rental car we had to pay for parking under the hotel. The parking garage was VERY tiny, if you are not good with parking or backing in, this is not the parking place for you. Parking was super expensive there. We later found out that people parked across the street at the Zoo because they didn't charge to park. I really wish we would have known that and saved ourselves $250.00 (YIKES). Anyhow, the lady at the front desk was super nice and helpful. We got to our room and put our code in to get inside, after opening the door I knew I was going to feel claustrophobic and overwhelmed the whole time. We had to big bags which fit underneath the hanging entertainment center, however it just made it seem even smaller. There was just enough room between the desk and bed to walk, between the entertainment center and bed, and then just enough space to open the fridge. We knew it would be small but I guess I didn't realize it from the photos. Of course, the size of the room is not a bad things, however if you are someone that doesn't like tight spaces and get overwhelmed it may be to small. Anyhow, after getting in the room I noticed the floor had sand and what not all over it. The cleaning lady came by and there was some confusion with her. I called the host who talked with me about the issue and said they would come by and check it out, which they did. After that I just cleaned it up. We had to end up cleaning the air conditioner filter out because our allergies were going crazy after a few days there. I had to clean out the fridge and freezer because there was food left in there. The host did provide several toiletries which was super helpful if someone forgets things. The description for this room explains the electrical issue with the microwave, stove top, and hairdryer. However, on 2 separate occasions, I used the microwave and the stove top at the same time and immediately it trip the breaker. Once that happened, we had to walk down stairs and ask them to turn it back on. The hotel does have a trash chute but it is only open 8am to 9pm which I thought was very weird. Anyhow, the hotel was located right across the street from the beach, right next to a Starbucks and had 2 restaurants inside of it. Along the beach there was numerous restaurants and shops so we just walked to them. Driving in that area is a pain and on several occasions we almost got hit by a tour bus. Our personal opinion of Waikiki was that is was..."},{"_id":"203293070","date":{"$date":"2017-10-14T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5960384","reviewer_id":"1966747","reviewer_name":"Chris","comments":"Perfect location, quiet, yet just at the edge of the main drag.

Talk to the lobby concierge about tours.  Don't miss the views from the 10th floor observation deck.  The only draw-back to the room is that the balcony faces buildings and exposes you to the noise of the air-conditioning turbines of the lower floors.

No, really; it's awesome. For people who are in Hawaii to get out and see and do things, or just chillax and maybe go for a dip in the water at the beach; this place is great.  It is definitely smaller than a hotel room, but we didn't need space.  The room is stocked with everything you could need for an enjoyable holiday, from beach towels and a bag to carry them in, to surf toys to play with while in the water, not to mention, everything you could need to cook in the kitchen, or to get yourself ready for the day in the bathroom.  Huge TV to enjoy cable programs on as well. \n\nWe went to Costco and got a few fixings for Christmas dinner and made a feast right there in the room, and had our meal on the 10th floor veranda overlooking the beach and front and center views of Diamond Head, dining with my 87 year old aunt and my mother on Christmas day and ...seriously...couldn't have asked for anything better.\n\nThe front desk staff were lovely and the manager really helpful (especially when we blew the breaker on Christmas Day)  \n\nThanx for having us, Judith.

Judith offered beach towels, chairs, floatys and everything needed for fun in the sun. The balcony added a nice relaxing touch after a long day of outings. Decor was nice and the condo was clean, just as advertised. The hotel (condo inside Waikiki Grand Hotel) staff were friendly, set us up with a snorkeling tour to Hanauma bay, and after check out they kept our luggage until we headed to the airport later that evening. We were even able to get picked up from our hotel to go skydiving at Skydive Hawaii on the North Shore. Judith and the family communicated well, especially prior to our trip. The only concern was that the WiFi did not work for us. However, it wasn't a big deal as we were there for vacation, not work.

The only confusion we had was at check in we thought we had to go to the front to check in but it ended up that we just had to go straight to the room and just type the code. We even had good luck finding parking on the street to avoid costs! But again, everything is walkable (we didn’t have a car for the first three days) so a car is not entirely necessary. Finally, if you wanted to do something outdoors and touristy, we walked from this spot to the peak of Diamond Head and back. Round trip is 7 miles.

Being on the edge of all the action in a slightly older building and just outside of the more luxurious center of Waikiki meant there were fewer clusters of tourists outside the hotel and driving in and out of the area to go other places was a snap.  I walked through Waikiki every night and was happy to return to my room in a slightly less crowded spot with the beach and zoo just across the street.  If you’re looking for a 5 Diamond room this isn’t for you, it’s small and in an aging (but well kept) building but if you’re looking for awesome value and a killer location for access to Waikiki shopping, restaurants, and beaches as well as ease of getting in/out of the area this is a great option.  The places was clean and had everything I need.  I felt safe and comfortable. The only thing I wish it had were cotton sheets instead of microfiber bedding, that stuff was sooooo hot I ended up sleeping on top of two breathable cotton towels but I tend to sleep hot.  Parking was also easy to reserve and reasonably priced for the area (just make sure to call ahead and know that the smaller the car the better for tiny city parking stalls).  Hope to return!"},{"_id":"357613837","date":{"$date":"2018-12-10T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5960384","reviewer_id":"15094567","reviewer_name":"Beverly","comments":"Great location, had a pleasant stay.

The breathtaking views of the Manhattan skyline are iconic and we found the apartment clean, spacious, conveniently located and functional.\r\nIt is well equipped with a large screen Tv with cable and other technology, including free wifi. Be sure to pay attention to Fabio's technology instructions. \r\nThe neighborhood felt safe and friendly, even late at night, because there are so many people walking their dogs and coming and going from the subway and restaurants. \r\nIt's an easy walk to stores and restaurants in Williamsburg and parts of Fort Greene, and a short subway ride into Manhattan on the L line fron the Bedford Station. On the host's recommendation, we used Northside car service several times and found it highly reliable.\r\nThe apartment is near the corner of 12th and Union, overlooking McCarren Park. When we were there, in mid-May, the well-lighted park was busy with soccer players, joggers and walkers from early morning until long after dark. There is a huge, relatively new public swimming pool as part of the park, the equivalent of a few blocks away from the apartment.\r\nThe apartment has two enjoyable small terraces, one off the living room and the other off the master bedroom.\r\nThe apartment and its furniture are showing some small signs of wear and tear, but overall it was an excellent experience  and we would gladly stay there again.

From their it's a 10 minute commute to Soho/Meatpacking and about 20 minutes to Central Park. The place is really spacious and the views are absolutely amazing! And if you're into sports, there's a big running track in the park in front of the place. We used it every morning. \r\n\r\nThe only thing that could be improved to make my 4 stars a 5 star rating is the attention to small details. There are some things that need a little maintenance, e.g. screws that aren't completely fixed, blinds that aren't working 100% smooth anymore. Nothing really big that couldn't be fixed in a days work. \r\n\r\nAgain, if you need a spacious place with great views and easy commute to Manhattan, this is great choice!

A full wall of windows in the living room and kitchen provide a stunning Manhattan ambience to the space, including a cozy but well-appointed, heated balcony.  The 2 bedrooms in the back oppositely face out to a beautiful southern Brooklyn view, complete with the master bedroom's additional walk-out balcony with sun-lounger. The master also has a beautiful adjoining bathroom where, leaving the door open, you could shower looking across the bedroom to the same view. The apartment's residential neighborhood near North Williamsburg is also ideal -- only 5 min walk to Bedford (L) subway station, which will get you west to Manhattan's 14St/Union Square station in 3 stops (~8 minutes on board).  We also experimented with taxis back from Manhattan: after midnight a cab was $28 from Times Square and $38 from Harlem, before tips.  Our group didn't mind paying this since staying in Manhattan with these conveniences (and view) would have been at least $800/night.  Fabio's apartment is conveniently only 1 block from Khim's natural grocery store (which was open past 1am on a Friday and has ICE, which was a good find since the apartment does not have an ice dispenser), and there is a heap of cute shops and locales on Bedford Ave too.  The cleanliness of the apartment was great considering the previous group left around noon and I needed to check in at 2pm the same day -- I'm convinced this is the only reason a couple of the smaller details were overlooked (some stains on the couch's slip cover, unsightly black scuffs on most of the walls and doors, which I wiped down, so no worries now!).  I'm sure with more preparation time these items would have been addressed, but we were excited to begin our stay and were not burdened by these details -- everything else certainly made up for it!  Note: responding to previous reviewers, Fabio does provide 2 sets of keys now, and if you want to avoid doorman confrontations (not that we experienced any), it's easy to use the ground-level entrance (\"B - basement\" on the elevator) as opposed to the main lobby up the front stairs.  Oh -- and Fabio provided the FLUFFIEST towels, wow!  Another great AirBnB experience indeed."},{"_id":"8922496","date":{"$date":"2013-11-25T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"598612","reviewer_id":"8364184","reviewer_name":"Dino","comments":"Fabio's place is stunning.

Fabio's place is right on the border between Williamsberg and Greenpoint two really great neighborhoods of Brooklyn, and the rest is just a quick subway or better yet bike ride away. The McCarren framer's market is right there at the base of the building on Saturday and is a place you can get wonderful produce, meat and cheeses. The entire experience was delightful.

I had read the previous reviews about the doorman and met him once when we first arrived, he was pleasant enough, but we used the basement entrance for the rest of the stay.

The view from this condo is amazing with sunsets right off the deck. The place was not as clean as I would expect. It seemed as though one of the bed sheets had not been changed as there were stains, make-up and hair all over. This was the room with the mattress on the floor. My husband and I are in our late 40's and really expected more than a mattress on the floor for $500/night. There were no amenities such as soap to wash your hands in the main bathroom or for showering. This was my first Airbnb experience so maybe that is how it is suppose to be. Master bedroom and bath were better but again there was used soap in the shower and no washcloths out for use. I had to find linens in an extra closet and thankfully there were extra sheets and pillowcases. I did email Fabio and he did respond the next day to see if we need maid service but we had already cleaned up everything. This part of Brooklyn is up and coming and it was much more relaxed than Manhattan with lots of great shops and restaurants. A must try is The Meatball Shop. Don't wander too far as you might end up in a BAD neighborhood. Easy subway access to get to anywhere!!

The apt is gorgeous, the views breathtaking, the location is supercool and the hosts incredibly friendly and accommodating. \r\n\r\nWe lived in Williamsburg for years, so for us it was a no-brainer. But if you're on the fence about staying in Brooklyn, do not worry. You'll be within a 5 minute walk to a one stop subway ride to the city or a 10 minute cab ride into the Lower East Side. Not to mention Williamsburg is packed with awesome bars and restaurants.\r\n\r\nPlus, an awesome park with a running track is literally across the street."},{"_id":"21333468","date":{"$date":"2014-10-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"598612","reviewer_id":"600059","reviewer_name":"Christine","comments":"Fabio's apartment is lovely and it really does have one of the best views of Manhattan, further enhanced by the green vista of McCarren Park. Our group of four middle-aged women stayed in the apartment for almost three weeks. Both Fabio (who is usually overseas) and his local assistant, Thiago, were friendly and helpful. When I first inspected the apartment, the doorman who buzzed me in was quick to point out that subletting was frowned upon and that we couldn't make any requests of the front desk. Fabio had agreed to give us two sets of keys during our stay but unfortunately the people who checked out before us returned their keys to the doormen (don't do this!), meaning we couldn't access those keys and had to make do with only one set. I thought it would be a problem because of the doormen situation, but they continued to buzz us in when necessary. As long as you don't make a fuss and don't bother the other residents, they will be civil. Note: this is not a building for parties!\r\n\r\nPros: Stunning view, quiet location, easy access to transport, park across the road, great neighborhood.\r\nCons: Doormen and some residents seem to resent subletters. Furniture is a bit chipped and showing signs of wear. There was a plumbing emergency and the plumbers told us not to drink the water that came out of the faucet in this building, because the pipes were not good – best to use a water filter jug instead."},{"_id":"22483128","date":{"$date":"2014-11-08T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"598612","reviewer_id":"15256392","reviewer_name":"Dimitri","comments":"Fabio was good with getting back to us.

We stayed for a month and loved the neighbourhood - great vibe, great bars, coffee shops, restaurants, gig venues (check out Rough Trade, some incredible acts here), a wealth of brilliant vintage clothes and furniture shops, indy cinemas etc.  It's also quick and easy to get into Manhattan on the L train.  There's also a toy room in the building, next to the gym, which our 2 year old daughter loved playing in.  And loads in the neighbourhood for kids to do too.

McCarren Park is literally across the street, and the views from both sides of the apartment are beautiful.  When we first walked in, we noticed that the apartment furniture is starting to show a few signs of wear, but we were traveling with our daughter and there was a high chair waiting for us, so I can't say it ever crossed our mind again.  The only thing that actually bothered me was that the front desk guys (or more likely whoever manages them) made it clear that they were nonplussed about airbnb in general.  Fortunately, there's another entrance on street level that was both super easy to navigate with a stroller and had no unhelpful doorman.

We were a bit surprised however, and disappointed, that a unit with the title, \"A breathtaking view...\" had scaffolding and a net in front of the windows.  We were not advised of this beforehand, nor discounted because of it.  This seemed to diminish the unit's main asset.  The neighborhood was great with about a five-block walk to a subway station.  There was another unfortunate issue - the owner appears to be having an ongoing dispute with the building, resulting in advice by a concierge that their services would not be available to us as guests of this unit.  Whether this is true or not, we felt in the middle of a dispute we as guests should not be faced with. When the fob to let us into the building stopped working late on the second day of our stay, I alerted Bruna, and eventually Fabio, to this but we never received a replacement.  Luckily, the concierges buzzed us into the building anyway despite the dispute. Finally, another disappointment - the second bedroom does indeed have a king mattress, but it was on the floor.  How expensive would it be for the owner to get a simple frame on which to put the mattress?  For the price of the unit, we really should not have to sleep on a mattress on the floor. Again, not what a class act should be doing.  Although there were good things about this unit, they were outweighed by the disappointments, all of which the owner has the ability to address."},{"_id":"47958840","date":{"$date":"2015-09-22T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"598612","reviewer_id":"11495231","reviewer_name":"Kelly","comments":"Great apt exactly as described!!

In dem geräumigen Apartment haben wir uns zu Viert (plus Baby) sehr wohl gefühlt. Die Wohnung ist komplett eingerichtet, es ist alles da, was man im Alltag benötigt.  \r\n\r\nPech hatten wir lediglich damit, dass die wirklich tolle Aussicht auf Manhattan wegen eines Baugerüsts vor dem Gebäude verstellt war - wofür Fabio aber nichts kann.\r\n\r\nIm zweiten Schlafzimmer befand sich bei unserem Aufenthalt lediglich eine Matratze auf dem Boden, was für uns aber kein Problem und wegen unseres Babys, das bei uns im Bett schlief, eher von Vorteil war. Ein neues Bett ist aber angeblich bereits unterwegs und sollte während unseres Aufenthalts geliefert werden. Toll fanden wir, dass ein Babystuhl vorhanden war, was uns vieles erleichtert hat. \r\n\r\nFabio selber war nicht da, dafür hat uns seine nette Freundin Bruna in Empfang genommen und uns alles erklärt. Wir konnten uns jederzeit an sie wenden, wenn wir Fragen hatten. Bruna hat uns auch erzählt, dass die Doorman nicht sehr gut auf die Touristen im Apartment zu sprechen sind, aber das ist eigentlich kein Problem. Links vom Haupteingang befindet sich ein kleinerer Eingang durch den man ebenfalls ins Haus kommt und somit den Doorman so aus dem Weg gehen kann.\r\n\r\nDie Verbindung nach Manhatten ist mit dem L-Train problemlos. Aber auch das Viertel rund um die Wohnung ist sehenswert und bietet mit seinen Kneipen, Restaurants und Geschäften genügend unterhaltungswert. Direkt vor dem Haus ist ein Park, der sich bestens zum Sport treiben eignet.\r\n\r\nWir können dieses Apartment nur weiterempfehlen.

We were concerned it might affect our stay, however, it did not at all and from that point on, everyone in the building was easy to deal with and lovely towards us. \n\nFabio and his family seemed to be rushing out on holiday upon our arrival, and there were a couple of things that seemed like they may have been forgotten about upon tidying up- food in the microwave, wet towels in the wash, etc- but honestly the view and apartment were so lovely and above our expectations that it was no problem. \n\nWe hope to visit again soon and would absolutely recommend Fabio and his apartment in Brooklyn.

First, its photos and descriptions were very misleading.  While the views of the Manhattan skyline were impressive, the apartment itself was rundown and in need of repairs.  The furniture was not what was shown in the photos.  There were no rugs on the floors which were in desperate need of refinishing and were dirty and stained with grime.  The shades in one bedroom were broken and couldn’t be raised or lowered.  The bathroom door in the master bedroom was off its rails and couldn’t be closed.  There were no functional lights in one bedroom and the door to the outside deck was broken and couldn’t be opened.  We were very disappointed given the “hype” of the advertisement.  A more accurate description would have been “Rent from an absentee landlord whose interest has waned and whose neighbors are upset.”\r\n\r\nThat’s the second reason we were disturbed by our experience and doubt we’ll rent from AB\u0026B again.  We were told by several people that the owner of the unit we rented is in conflict with the condo association in the building and in litigation over maintenance fees.  He’s very unpopular with other owners, guests can’t use the work out Room and admit that they are staying in 16B, and can’t leave the keys when they leave the building with the concierge because the owner is so unpopular.  My family and I came to Brooklyn for a family occasion, to relax, and see a show.  We did not come to take part in someone else’s conflict with his neighbors, profit-making rip off, and another example of the Great American social media scam.  Let’s ask for a little integrity in how AB\u0026B treats its customers and its neighbors.  I would never want to repeat this experience again."},{"_id":"262953092","date":{"$date":"2018-05-10T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"598612","reviewer_id":"2204331","reviewer_name":"David","comments":"Fabio's place was fantastic and just as advertised/pictured.

We are a family of five and it suited our needs brilliantly. Facilities in the apartment are excellent and the view is spectacular 24/7. It’s the 16th floor of an 18 floor building, which is one of the tallest in the area. Directly in front is McCarren Park, which means there are uninterrupted views of Manhattan, either from the living room or a small terrace, accessed from the living room. There is a second, small terrace on the other side of the apartment, accessed from the master bedroom. The local neighbourhood has plenty of grocery stores, bars and restaurants. Subway is a 10 minute walk (Lorimer St/ Metropolitan Avenue or Bedford Avenue) but once there it’s a quick ride into Manhattan.

The day before the move in, we received an email saying the heater didn't work in the 2nd bedroom so they were providing a space heater. We tried this out on our first night, but this one didn't supply even heat throughout the night so our 13-month old son woke up shivering in the middle of the night. The master bedroom heater didn't work well either. It was 65 in the morning although the heater was set for 70.  Although they were willing to help, we realised it would take 2-3 days to get this fully sorted and we simply didn't have the time for that because we had important things to take care of in NYC. We moved out after 1 night, even though we had initially booked it for 10 days. I believe airbnb has required them to fix the heater issue before they can accept more guests. \n\nApart from this, the apartment does NOT look like the photos. The sofas are not white. There is now an L-shaped grey sofa and a polka dot armless 2-seater. The dining chairs are now all black leather. The TV in the apartment is maybe a 36\" and the one in the photos looks like a 50\". The artwork on the walls in the living room and master bedroom are gone and there is no decorative items on the coffee table. They have hung the mirror seen on the floor in the photos on the wall. The photos make the unit look warm, lived-in and stylish, but this is not how it looks in real life. The host really should update the photos. The host told us the photos are 5 years old and that he has improved the furniture. I think it's unfair to rent anything on airbnb that doesn't look like the photos. \n\nOn a positive note, the view is amazing and just like the photos. The kitchen and bathrooms are fine, the beds are comfortable and there is a washer and dryer in the unit. It's right next to McCarren Park which has so much to offer: running track, playground, outdoor gym and hang out areas. Williamsburg also seems really quaint. We wish we could have experienced all this."},{"_id":"414007752","date":{"$date":"2019-02-18T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"598612","reviewer_id":"27176834","reviewer_name":"Jason","comments":"Views views views!!

Princeville is perched above legendary Hanalei Bay and has its own shopping center complete with a supermarket, post office, yoga studio, cafe, galleries, shops and restaurants. Come enjoy its golf courses, bike/walking path, secluded beaches, and sunset views. Outdoor activities abound-- hike, bike, kayak, zipline, horseback ride to a waterfall, windsurf, snorkel, stand up paddle board, take surf lessons, or just grab a beach chair, sink your toes into the sand and take it all in! ","notes":"Because the apartment is in a condo complex, there are some things that are out of our control, such as unscheduled pool maintenance, in which case not only the pool but the jacuzzi and BBQ grills are unavailable. As in most residences in Kauai, there is no air conditioning. During the late spring and summer months, in addition to the ceiling fan in the living room, a standing fan and a table fan are available for your use. Please turn them off when not in the condo. Internet access is not 100% reliable--our provider, Oceanic Time Warner, occasionally does maintenance and high winds and/or storms can interrupt service as well.  The condo shares a wall with the unit next door. While we did put in extra soundproofing, it's not perfect. If you are planning on spending lots of time indoors, this may be a problem.  Cell coverage from within the condo (and in Kauai in general) is much better with Verizon than AT\u0026T (don't know about other carriers).  Your total includes 4% General Excise Tax ","transit":"The almost necessary way to travel is by car, although there is a public bus that runs from Kekaha on the south side to Hanalei on the north. Fares and schedules are available online (search Kauai bus schedules).","access":"The condo is in Sandpiper Village which has an open layout with lawns and tropical landscaping.

We knew each other in our early teens and remained friends into our 20s. In 2004 we ran into each other completely serendipitously and a few years later were married in our garden in Berkeley, surrounded by friends and family. We are both interested in art, architecture and music, where his tastes are classically inclined and mine tend more towards the Grateful Dead and lately, everything ukulele.  We love hiking, reading, traveling and good conversation.\r\n\r\nMy first trip to Kauai was in 1975 and it was love at first sight. Smitten, and haunted by memories of green and blue and rainbows and Bali Hai, I moved there in 1977, just in time for my twin daughters to be born at Wilcox Hospital in Lihue.  We ended up moving back to the mainland a year later, but in the intervening years, we vacationed there many times as a family. One of the twins eventually heeded the island's call and in 2012 moved to Princeville with her husband and family. (You could probably count on one hand the number of days they have not been at the beach or on a wave since moving!) I hope to persuade my city-loving husband to consider retiring to Kauai. So far he has promised me a month per year.  That's a start.\r\n\r\nWe hope your stay in Hale Nani or Hale Nani Iki is a pleasant one.\r\n","host_response_time":"within a few hours","host_thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/1761087/profile_pic/1428719703/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","host_picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/1761087/profile_pic/1428719703/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","host_neighbourhood":"Kauaʻi","host_response_rate":95,"host_is_superhost":true,"host_has_profile_pic":true,"host_identity_verified":true,"host_listings_count":2,"host_total_listings_count":2,"host_verifications":["email","phone","facebook","reviews","jumio","government_id"]},"address":{"street":"Princeville, HI, United States","suburb":"Kauaʻi","government_area":"North Shore Kauai","market":"Kauai","country":"United States","country_code":"US","location":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-159.47621,22.22149],"is_location_exact":true}},"availability":{"availability_30":3,"availability_60":4,"availability_90":10,"availability_365":103},"review_scores":{"review_scores_accuracy":10,"review_scores_cleanliness":10,"review_scores_checkin":10,"review_scores_communication":10,"review_scores_location":10,"review_scores_value":10,"review_scores_rating":96},"reviews":[{"_id":"30847348","date":{"$date":"2015-04-27T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5986898","reviewer_id":"292417","reviewer_name":"Dana","comments":"Our original airbnb apartment cancelled on us the last minute and Sarah was kind enough to let us book her place on an extremely late notice.

On the downside, it's a bottom level condo and the walls are very thin so you can hear the neighbors upstairs and around you very well. It almost sounds like someone is in the other room at times. Also their was no ac in the unit so we had to sleep with the windows open with screens  because of this in the morning you would be awakened by anyone who starts a car or is even walking around the building.

I slept on the sofa sleeper in the living room and found it to be as comfortable as you'd expect a sofa sleeper to be. I shared the unit with my step-father, and he told me that the bed in the bedroom was comfortable. There was a small amount of street noise that he could hear, but nothing that kept him awake.\r\n\r\nFrom the other reviews, it seems as though some people have had issues with noise from other units. I had assumed that this would be noise through the walls, which I was a little nervous about. Instead, it's just the normal conversations of residents enjoying their lanais and having your own windows open to enjoy the outside air (no A/C, just fans in this unit, which is fine for how cool and comfortable it is at night on this part of the island). We could definitely hear them talking, as the units aren't too far away from one another, but no one was being loud or disrespectful of their neighbors. (Note: The proximity to other units and noise is the only reason it's a 4-star review instead of 5. I'd give 4.5 if possible.)\r\n\r\nFinally, the condo is very well stocked with everything you could need to be comfortable for your stay. It was really nice to not have to worry about beach towels or chairs, and everything was clean and in great shape. All in all, this was a wonderful place to stay. Sarah's unit in Princeville was a perfect location for getting away from the busier parts of the island and still being within a reasonable drive to hikes, beaches, and restaurants. The hot tub after a long day of hiking was a welcomed reprieve as well."},{"_id":"72937659","date":{"$date":"2016-05-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5986898","reviewer_id":"61044166","reviewer_name":"Emily","comments":"Sarah was extremely kind, responsive, and informative.

The place was spacious, kitchen had all the gadgets needed, the living space was opening and welcoming. Everything worked and the host was very responsive when we needed a few questions answered. The walls are half vented screens, so expect that the place won't exactly be totally sound proof. However, you'll get the fresh, lovely Hawaiian air flowing through all day! Loved the little touches, like key box (to ease anxiety over lost keys! etc), multiple sets of thick beach towels, snorkels and fins, Kauai guidebook, games and cards etc. \n\nWe had our wedding and honeymoon in Kauai and Sarah's place was the perfect nest to come home to after a day's worth of adventures.

We gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only because of the significant amount of road noise that infiltrates the condo (tip: fans and earplugs help)! the roosters carry on a fair amount, but we actually loved the roosters, as well as the many other songbirds that sang at all hours of the day and night! :) Sarah's home is very clean and well-appointed with kitchen appliances, as well as laundry facilities in the home which was a major plus! the sofa bed was super comfy for our kiddos, and the king sized bed was decently comfy (although not as comfy as our ah-mayzing bed at home...are they ever? LOL)! her home is conveniently located very close to grocery shopping (Foodland), ice cream (a must!), and has tons of beaches nearby to explore! we would have appreciated a few additional items already stocked in the pantry for ease of cooking-especially since we arrived too late to shop! Basics (such as coffee, sugar, creamer, olive oil, and a wider array of spices) would be nice additions to find in the pantry! but we made some ah-mayzing dinners with fresh fish we bought at the Hanalei Fish Market while we were there, and found everything we needed at Foodland. the neighbors in the complex (whom we had heard could be noisy) were thankfully silent during our stay! the little girls who live nearby were super friendly and very excited to see our boys each morning! neighbors, residents, and other guests at the pool area were quite friendly, and we loved finishing our busy days there! :) from Sarah's home, we were super close to highlights such as the Kalalau trail (for an EPIC hike); Queen's Bath (get to the parking lot at 7a if you want to drive there and find a spot); and we found ah-mayzing snorkeling at Anini Beach, Tunnels, and Hideawy. Sarah's snorkeling gear is of great quality and we REALLY appreciated having it there for our use! you can rent additional fins all over, as well as boogie boards-which we did because the boogie boards at Sarah's house were broken when we arrived. :( we took a day trip to Waimea Canyon and the Kalalau Lookout, and spent a truly beautiful week there! my husband and i, and our boys (10 and 11) had a really joyful vacation, and Sarah's place was a comfortable place to start and finish our days. it is small, so make sure you LOVE being uber-cozy with your travel companions! :) an added bonus was the guide book (The Ultimate Guide to Kauai)...what a GEM! thanks to that book we found some GREAT adventures we might have missed! like crazy-hard-to-find beaches, etc!!! we are grateful for the blessings of our trip and for the beauty of Kauai. thank you for hosting us-The Edwards Clan, Pollock Pines (Nik, D, Ben, \u0026 Sam) :)"},{"_id":"147062476","date":{"$date":"2017-04-24T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5986898","reviewer_id":"116164033","reviewer_name":"Amber","comments":"The condo is homey and everything you need, down to the perfect guidebook.

The unit was very clean and offered amenities such as dishwasher and washer/dryer. Sarah left a very useful guidebook which we used for restaurants and things to do. Princeville is a walker's delight with paths all around, it has a shopping plaza within walking distance that has shops, a grocery store, and restaurants. Unfortunately Princeville is not noted for great weather. It is a very rainy area with little sun. Beaches are nice (but  I personally do not like to be on the beach in the rain and without sun). There are hiking trails, beaches, walking paths, and things to do in the area and  if you travel approximately 10 miles south (going toward Kapa'a)  the weather is less rainy. We were disappointed in the noise level due to traffic that goes on at all hours. Princeville is made up of many separate communities. There are many units behind the Sandpiper and cars and trucks pass through. Since the windows are open (no A/C) traffic is very loud. Another disappointment  was the lack of privacy while sitting on the lanai and not being able to keep the blinds open.  The units are very close together and neighbors walk by, as well as we can hear and see everything also. While sitting on the lanai in the morning having our coffee we heard a neighbor in the bathroom, not a way to start the day although we laughed about it. We were out most of the day as you probably will be so the location, cleanliness, hospitality, and amenities out way the disappointments. I would not recommend for long stays but a few days are good."},{"_id":"256496738","date":{"$date":"2018-04-22T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5986898","reviewer_id":"47414568","reviewer_name":"Tyler","comments":"Everything about our stay with Sarah was fantastic.

Auch der Pool in der Anlage ist ein Plus. Persönlich etwas gestört hat uns, dass die Kommunikation zwar sehr schnell, aufmerksam und informativ ist, jedoch auch viele Anweisungen und Hausregeln enthält - das mindert das entspannte Urlaubsgefühl. Auch ist die Einrichtung schon etwas abgenutzt und der Balkon wenig einladend. Ausserdem ist die Lärmbelastung aufgrund der dünnen Wände gerade nachts störend.

We really enjoyed her suggestions during our stay in the city, and hopefully the next time we will try the ones we missed  -not enough time for everything!. Unfortunately we could not say goodbye to her, as she was busy at the time we left. \r\nThe apartment is nicely located close to the centre -you can easily walk to the main touristic areas. It is also very close to the Metro station Campo 24 de Agosto, which takes you directly to the airport. There are bakeries and small shops/supermarkets in the same street (even a bakery besides with fine pastries for breakfast) and, for those in need of a big supermarket, there is a Pingo Doce in Rua de Passos Manuel, at a walking distance of about 5-10 min.  \r\nThe apartment itself is cosy and bright: in fact, light  coming in through the big windows is one of the best things, and we really enjoyed sitting on the sofa in the living room to read after getting up, surrounded by light. The bathroom is a bit old-fashioned, but this is shown in the photos and we were perfectly fine with it except maybe for the fact that it lacked a bit more electric light as it has no window. Something unimportant, though! \r\nWe believe that this is a good place to stay for anyone visiting Porto."},{"_id":"31229775","date":{"$date":"2015-05-03T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"598806","reviewer_id":"3691388","reviewer_name":"Kalin","comments":"Laetitia provided helpful tips and suggestions for sights and restaurants in Porto.

The apartment is not completely soundproof but this has an upside too, such as the occasional call of seagulls heard through the bathroom vent.  The (shared) wireless connection works better in the hallway or in the bakery next door, which makes a tempting range of pastries and sells a good cup of coffee for only 65 cents.

Plastic used bottle under the curtain, ate fruit core next to the living room TV apparently there is a big problem with cleaning service.

Used to dry my hand drying clothes. Location next to the king cross, I can not say it is super downtown cuz it wasn't that central. But it is a bar\u0026a restaurant street. Dominio  in walking distance \n4. The downstairs shared public washing machine is right next to the trash place with all over the dead giant body of cockroaches. You don't want to wash your clothe there. I did all my laundry by hands.\n5 bathroom shower tap always leaking + the water sink in a TERRIBLE design+ cockroach activating zone.

It is exactly as pictured and situated in a great neighborhood surrounded by countless shops and restaurants, even a glorious supermarket that’s worth a visit just to browse. It’s easily accessible from the airport by subway train, just 3 or 4 blocks from where you get off. I was given excellent directions to the apartment, which is in a very secure building, up one flight of stairs. The unit was very clean, the water instantly hot and the strongest water pressure I’ve ever seen. The large desk and ample countertop made it really handy to spread things out, set up the laptop, etc. The wifi was fast. I didn’t watch any TV but there’s a huge one in front of a comfy sofa. The bedroom isn’t overly spacious but it has a large, comfortable bed and was more than adequate for me. I especially appreciated the room-darkening draperies in the bedroom. The place is quite quiet for being so close to the action outdoors. \n\nOllie was a great host. He gave me a Sydney guidebook and pointed out places of interest, which was especially appreciated given that I hadn’t planned much in advance. He lives just a couple of doors down, so he’s at your service whenever needed. When I foolishly locked myself out, he was promptly there to let me back in. \n\nI highly recommend Hugo’s place to anyone. You could pay a lot more and stay at a place like the Waldorf Astoria. But I don’t like to pay a fortune for lodging when I can get a perfectly suitable place like this for a reasonable price."},{"_id":"239043460","date":{"$date":"2018-02-28T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5993432","reviewer_id":"6840540","reviewer_name":"Wafa","comments":"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here and although I did not meet Hugo, Ollie was amazing in every way.

Apartment and building are vintage - a little rough around the edges, but clean, comfy, and nice to come home to at the end of the day. Building is safe (front door key access). \n\nNote - there is no freezer, and bedroom does not have a door (a thick curtain instead). \n\nAlso - the bedroom is well circulated by the breeze if you leave the window open, but light sleepers might be interrupted by street noise (window opens to an alley between this building and the next). \n\nSmall desk fan in lounge room works just fine, but not sure how building would be in summer (no a/c). \n\nBathroom very well stocked with toiletries, and bedroom has handy shelving/hangers for clothes. A 10 minute leisurely walk straight to Oxford St. \n\nGood value for money given the location.

The place was very functional, perfect for cooking my own meals at times during my 15 night stay.  The shower's water pressure was very strong and the hot water almost instantaneous (having a bathtub was a nice bonus).  The bed was very comfy with extra linens at hand, including plenty of large bath towels.  The oven didn't work nor was there a freezer as (both) stated in the printed instructions, but that didn't deter me from creating nice meals during my visit.  The portable space heater worked in a pinch when temperatures dropped a bit during the winter nights.  The unit backs onto a alleyway so not much natural light, but the interior lighting flooded the apartment nicely.  The apartment was very quiet, and very peaceful, just perfect after a busy day or night about town.  Check-in was a breeze, Ollie readily accommodated my early arrival and arrived seconds within my announced arrival on-site.  Ollie was very helpful, provided guide books in the unit and provided me with his own travel insight on places to visit in the local area.  Ollie was also quick to inquire about linen changes mid week, their laundering, including for bath towels.  Ollie was always just a text message away to offer any assistance when needed.  In summary, this place and Ollie as a host, made for a lovely hassle free 15 night stay in Sydney.  I definitely recommend this charming little place and I would return again.

He is a very nice Shepard/Chow mix who loves walks and activities of all kinds. He is a shared dog with his Mom owner keeping him half the time down the street. Dog lovers are more than welcome to go for a walk with him whenever they like. For those with small children, Kuma does not like children putting their hands in his face and mouth and will growl or bark with displeasure so please be mindful with small children. For those unfamiliar with the tropics, you might see a friendly gecko from time to time inside and out. They help guard against insects and bugs so we actually don't mind them around.","transit":"There is a bus stop down the road and bikes right outside the back door. The famous Pipeline surf break is walking distance and Sunset Beach is too, just a bit further away. Foodland (groceries), Shark's Cove (snorkeling), Waimea Valley and many many beachs,  and many fantastic beaches are a bike ride away. Lots of food trucks to choose from around the area (especially near Foodland) and lots of great restaurant choices in Haleiwa town (about 10 minutes south by car). The Turtle Bay Resort is only about 10-15  minutes north by car and offers some fantastic restaurants (Lei Lei's is one of our favorites). And don't miss the Pool Bar for a sunset with free live music nightly.","access":"Guests have their own private entry from the sliding glass door on the deck. The door is left unlocked for your arrival and comes with a digital door lock for when you are there in the unit. The guest living room is furnished with a microwave and fridge. The area is plenty spacious for 2 people. There are many choices of food places around with the Turtle Bay Resort and Haleiwa Town only 10-15 minutes away (with no traffic) and delicious  food trucks and Foodland about 1/2 mile away. Bikes (two) are available to guests and we encourage guests to go out for a ride on the bike path that runs up and down the coastline. Guests have their own deck to enjoy an outside lounge and enjoy the solar tree lanterns as they light up at dusk.  *** Future guests, please note that detailed check-in instructions are included in the confirmation email sent by AIRBNB after you book the space. Please look for it to be sure that you received it.

There's a front porch with a table and a couple of comfortable chairs that we spent quite a bit of time on. The best part is your host, Mark (and his dog, Kuma). Mark goes out of his way to make you feel like family; he has bikes and beach gear that he welcomes you to borrow and, while his kitchen is not included in the rental, he was happy to let us use it when we needed something other than a microwave for our leftovers.

It was about a 5 minute leisurely ride up to Food Land and less than 2 minutes ride to check out Pipeline (which was quite an epic sight at 8 foot while we were there). there was also snorkelling equipment and body boards to use at our leisure which was really convenient. The wifi was great an the apartment has a smart TV. \r\nWe didn't actually see Mark while we were there, which made it feel even more private.

Huge flat screen tv in your own living room, fridge, air-con and ceiling fans (though i only needed the ocean breeze though my window), soap, shampoo, microwave, filtered water jug, kettle, crockery etc... everything you could possibly need. The bus stop is a few minutes walk away, so i didn't rent a car. He kindly lent me his bicycle and those bike pathways are so lovely to ride. On 2 wheels the beach is 1min away, Foodland supermarket is 5mins away, local food trucks everywhere selling the most delicious fresh food (mmmm, thai fish tacos!). The location is great. I was very lucky to have been there during Quiksilver's \"The Eddie\" big wave competition. That swell was a sight to see and never forgotten. Again no hassle with the crowds or parking, Waimea was a 5min bike ride away. Feel like a local and ditch the car! As a solo female traveller i felt safe and my belongings secure.

We had a private bedroom, bathroom and a small living room which was our favorite spot :)\nIf you are a surfer, it’s a 5 min walk (or 2 min bike) to some prime surfing spots on the NS (off the wall, backdoor, pipeline). The awesome bikes, made available by Mark, were our main mode of transportation (and one of the highlights of this place) while there as we were looking for a relaxed time, just going to some beaches and some local restaurants. There is also an outstanding beach for snorkeling just 5 mins by bike.\nHaleiwa (the biggest town nearby) is a 15 min drive, so I would definitely recommend to have a car to go there or some other north shore places that would be a little too far for biking. We did see a lot of public buses passing by which should be enough if you are not willing to get a car, but I’m not sure on the frequency.\nOverall this was our favorite spot in Oahu and we will definitely be back to Mark’s place whenever on the North Shore again.

Would definitely recommend staying with mark!"},{"_id":"155809996","date":{"$date":"2017-05-28T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6006340","reviewer_id":"36767565","reviewer_name":"Simon","comments":"I recommend Mark's place.

The north shore offers a far more scenic and beautiful coastline and seemed to have a laid back kind of lifestyle away from the big shops and high rise buildings. \nMark's place is very quiet and comfortable. Mark was able to offer his local knowledge to where we could go and things to see/do. We also used an app called Gpyse guide  to help us get around - which I found through one of the brochures that was in Marks place.  My husband and I enjoyed using the eski ( drink/food cooler)  and sitting on the  famous surfing beaches watching sunsets.  \nWe enjoyed riding the bikes to the food trucks just down the road. \nWe we're there in the summer time - so no big waves,  but the area is spectacular.  We will hopefully return one day to see the big surf. \nBeing on the Aussie dollar and losing a lot in exchange we are very grateful we could use air bnb to keep our costs down. \nWe highly recommend Marks place.  \n"},{"_id":"160331529","date":{"$date":"2017-06-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6006340","reviewer_id":"37167978","reviewer_name":"Sophie","comments":"Such a great place to stay on the North Shore. Ideal location for the beach, waves and local amenities (foodland and food trucks!). Mark was most welcoming, particularly in regards to our toddler, offering to source us a cot and beach umbrella. The guest bikes were amazing, a must for getting around (even though walking places is totally doable) The unit itself is clean and well kept, definitely value for money, and gave me an authentic Hawaiian feel during our stay in regards to decor and set up! I would 100% recommend Mark's place if you're a single person or couple and after a simple place to stay, at a great price and in a great location.

Unfortunately he was back on the main land during our stay so we didn't get to meet him but he was very easy to communicate with. He got us in contact with Mona, who also helps run the airbnb and lived in a separate structure neighboring the house. Mona was extremely nice and has a very welcoming personality. She gave us tips on places to go and even where to go to dolphin watch! Very nice lady!\n\nWe stay at Marks during the week then did an airbnb in the city on the weekend however we realized we should of definitely stayed at Marks the whole time. The setup is very very nice, with a little living room area, YOUR OWN bathroom, and a bedroom with a very comfy bed! The rest of the house (common areas) were spacious and he even has a great patio perfect to eat your breakfast at while surrounded by the sound of birds and green plants, or in the evenings sip wine under the hanging lights and bright stars. \nHe has a bunch of ocean supplies that you can borrow as well, no need to spend money on renting snorkels! One of the most important part is that he was right by the beach!! This beach was one of my favorites on the island. Its simply gorgeous! Make sure you bring a baggie with you because the sand is so neat you'll want to take some home with you. Another plus is that when we went there was hardly anyone on this beach, other ones can be more crowded. Its a perfect location! Theres a snorkeling area near by and other food places as well. It took us about an hour or so to go to the other side of the island which was very doable for us. You get a more local authentic feel of the island living on the north shore vs the typical tourist areas. I would highly recommend staying here!:) \n\n "},{"_id":"186889742","date":{"$date":"2017-08-25T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6006340","reviewer_id":"125078221","reviewer_name":"Joy","comments":"We loved our stay.

The fabled snorkelling of Sharks Cove is a 10 minute bike trip away and Pipeline would be a little less. Across from sharks cove is the food truck park and a food works supermarket is not far away either. We didn't meet Mark in person but his communication was fantastic and it was super easy to turn up and settle in. Everything we needed was at the house and our own room had a lounge, bathroom and bedroom that we could lock.  \n\nWe ate at the food trucks, my wife is coeliac (gluten allergic) and the taco van and Thai catered for her perfectly. We also checked out turtle cove resort for a drink one afternoon (we drove there in about 15 minutes) we ended up eating at Roy's beach house and the wait staff were fantastic with my wife's allergies. \n\nWe would definitely return to Marks and the Northshore if the opportunity arose."},{"_id":"189780602","date":{"$date":"2017-09-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6006340","reviewer_id":"135625751","reviewer_name":"Klaus","comments":"Wirklich tolle Unterkunft, es ist alles da und in der näheren Umgebung was man benötigt.

Ett stort plus är att man får låna cyklar och snorkelutrustning. Det var varmt och fuktigt inomhus och AC var väldigt högljudd så det var jobbigt att ha den på. Det var många små ödlor inomhus som klättrar på väggarna. Ett annat minus var att sängen är ganska liten för två personer och väldigt mjuk så att man rullar ner i mitten när man lägger sig.

Mark accommodated my every need and the tips he gave me of how to explore the island the best possible way were invaluable. His dog, Kuma, is the loveliest dog, you’ll end up cuddling with him and swimming with him in the ocean! He added so much joy to my stay at Mark’s.

It's is very expensive and Mark offered such a good rate we had to take it. When we arrived, we were so happy to see we were not too far from the beach it was right down the road and even closer to a grocery store and one of my favorite beaches \"Three Tables\". Mark was very friendly and made sure we were comfortable and had what we needed. He had everything, small living room with Netflix and cable, mini fridge and coffee maker, private bathroom and comfortable bed and pillows. The bedroom  view I could see the ocean a little. We met his dog Kuma (I think was the name ), who was very sweet. We felt like we had so much privacy even tho Mark was in and out, there's a key to lock your door. We mostly saw him in the morning. If you aren't  local, I can see he has plenty of books and tour guides. He also can help with suggestions. He is a very good host and made us very comfortable. He is not around too much if you like more privacy . There is AC in the bedroom which is a life saver! Closet and drawers and a hamper. The neighbor is also wonderful if you need her.  He said we can use the kitchen, however we didn't need to. He has an outside shower also to rinse off from the beach and snorkel gear and bikes to ride. He had beach towels for us also. The only thing about being that far into North Shore is depending where you want to go you will have to spend some time driving out of north shore. I particularly like being on that side the most but driving around the island only takes a couple hours. All the great beaches are just down the road and Haleiwa is no more than 15 minutes away. I read reviews before booking and all I heard was good things and yes they are all true. I WILL stay here again if it's available when I come back home. It was so relaxing, way better than a hotel in Waikiki, this is real Hawaii, not a busy city with traffic-yuk! So overall great experience, I'd  move back if I could afford it lol. I hope you book with him because it is worth it. If you come out and turn left you have Waimea Bay and Haleiwa town, if you go right you have Sunset beach, Polynesian Culture Center and Kualoa Ranch! (Where Jurassic Park was filmed) Both must sees! Reserve in advance for Kualoa, totally worth it! Sharks cove (snorkeling-no sharks ) and a great beach to see turtles! Food trucks all over! Enjoy your stay and know you're in good hands with Mark!! Aloha!!!

Nancy's home was well decorated and the amenities were as described. There was unusually warmer temps with humidity but with fans running and windows open, it was fine including at night. My family especially loved being across from the beach (water shoes recommended!) and the lovely little garden in the front yard. It was a great spot to observe nature and find geckos. We also like the close proximity of the Kualoa Ranch Beach Park-we loved the beautiful grounds and being able to swim directly in front of Chinaman's Hat island.

She went above and beyond to make us feel welcome, including a nice welcome package as well as a parting gift. The amenities were great; having a washer/dryer available meant that we didn't have to pack as many clothes or underwear and the beach towels Nancy provided checked one more thing off of our packing list. \r\n\r\nThe property met - and exceeded - my expectations. It's easy to find and has a nicely appointed interior. The two beds were very comfortable and I slept just as good as I would at home. The extra foldout bed was even comfortable enough for my teenage sister-in-law to sleep on without any complaints!\r\n\r\nOne of the things we enjoyed the most about our stay was the location. Kaaawa is outside of the major tourist areas, so we were able to avoid crowds and have some of the smaller, off-the-beaten-path beaches to ourselves. There are some great, if underrated, hikes nearby and the 7-11 next door makes it easy to find a late night snack or pick up any essentials you may have left at home.\r\n\r\nIf you like dogs, you'll love Nancy's neighbor's dog, Hulk (we didn't know his name at first so we called him Gus). He's the 'guard dog' and is a memorable part of our experience at Nancy's Paradise Beach House. We found several entries in Nancy's guest logs that mentioned how much they loved Hulk.\r\n\r\nI recommend this place for anyone, especially families or couples, looking for a nice private residence to stay in that's away from the hustle and bustle of Honolulu or North Shore tourist hotspots.

It's also close to a beautiful beach, though it's not that swimmable. There is Kaaawa beach very close driving distance. There was road construction and only 1 main road, which made driving to other destinations on the island a challenge. It's close to 711, but far from any type of larger stores like a Safeway. It's very rural. If you like to get away from the crowded Waikiki, it's a good place, just be prepared to drive a lot. Other than that, it's good place if you have kids and are looking for a budget.

Since we were out and about a lot as  we had family staying close by in the plantation estate \u0026 this place was literally a 5min walk.  We only used the kitchen  for a few breakfasts and making coffee \u0026 tea.  The one shared  bath was also spacious . We met the brother and his family who lived upstairs.  Nice  folks .

I understand this side of the island is more prone to bugs, but this was excessive.  We would've raised this to Nancy, but our stay was short (we arrived Friday late afternoon, attended a wedding Saturday, and left before dawn Sunday).  The shower curtain liner was also quite moldy - more than you would expect.  The positives.  Nancy responded to messages quickly, and set up a pack n play for our baby.  The kitchen pantry was nicely stocked so if you forgot something basic it was likely in the cupboard.  The AC in the main living area was nice to have, and the ceiling fans kept things sufficiently cool in the bedrooms.

A une dizaine de minutes à pied se trouve la station de métro la plus proche. La ligne A s'y arrête. Si vous prenez la direction \"uptown\", Manhattan (qui concentre 90% des \"incontournables\" de la Grosse Pomme) est à seulement quatre stations. En sens inverse, cette même ligne vous conduit directement à l'Airtrain (sorte de tramway aérien) qui vous dépose à l'aéroport JFK. Si donc vous souhaitez loger chez Loli, je vous conseille vivement d'atterrir à cet aéroport.\r\n\r\n      Vous trouverez à Marcy Avenue plusieurs épiceries qui pourront vous être utiles à quasi n'importe quelle heure de la journée qui pour un jus, un hamburger, un gâteau, un retrait d'espèces, etc...\r\n\r\n     La chambre, calme (pas un bruit), lumineuse et donnant sur le jardin à l'arrière, est munie d'un très grand lit.\r\n\r\n     Les petites attentions étaient là, et j'en fus sensible : carte de métro mise à disposition, petit paquet de délicieux chocolats, changement de la literie, chocolat le matin (que je n'ai jamais pris tellement j'étais pressé, à chaque fois, de partir à la découverte de \"la ville qui ne dort jamais\")... Et quand il me manquait quelque chose, Loli s'en occupait tout de suite. Ainsi acheta-t-elle aussitôt des cintres et une couette pour me satisfaire. Je pourrais résumer cela en une seule courte phrase : \"aussi tôt dit, aussi tôt fait\".\r\n\r\n     Nous ne nous sommes guère vu pendant mon séjour, Loli et Natty ayant dû chacun s'absenter quelques jours et moi me baladant incessamment à New York. Cela ne m'a pas trop dérangé dans la mesure où quand je rentrais à Brooklyn après avoir marché, marché et encore marché (prévoyez une bonne paire de tennis si vous comptez vous rendre dans la Grosse Pomme), je ne demandais qu'à prendre une bonne douche puis aller me coucher.\r\n\r\n   Le jour de mon départ, m'attendaient devant ma chambre deux cadeaux.

I would consider staying with them again if I come back to Bedford-Stuy.\r\n\r\nThe neighborhood is nice with very old buildings like the rest of Brooklyn. It's very residential, lots of families, a church, and an elementary school or two, and some of the inner streets might be very quiet. There's quite a few cheap eats between the apartment and the Nostrand train stop. Nostrand street is very active due all the businesses running there.

When I arrived I was shown around the gorgeous apartment where I had fresh towels, chocolates, and even a pair of slippers waiting.  Sitting on the table was everything needed to French Press my coffee in the morning and was given instructions on using the boiler for the water.  In the morning I was able to get some work done while drinking my coffee and later Nathanial came in and we had a great conversation about the event, and about the neighborhood as well as the history of the house.

Firstly she says she lives a block away from the subway. Untrue. She lives half a mile away and it takes an average of 15 minutes to walk there. She doesn't mention that you have to share a bathroom so you need patience. She lives in a very outside area of Brooklyn but once you get to the subway train connections are certainly efficient. You share the apartment with Loli and her husband and if he's home a third person again not mentioned. Fortunately for me he was out of town.

During the time of my stay, Loli was in France due to a family emergency.  She had a caretaker taking care of the apartment.  Unbeknownst to Loli and myself, the caretaker was staying there with her family which included her young two year old.  So there were up to 6 people staying in the house (on one night the other housemate had a guest) and sharing a bathroom.  This was quite a different experience from what I expected or desired.  To compensate me for my troubles, Loli offered me 'one of her favorite bottles of wine'.  But, this never materialized.  The bathroom was sometimes dirty (of course with 5 people and a baby) and the air-conditioning was on intermittently and the wifi was very slow and weak.   My previous experiences with Air Bnb in NYC had been great, so this was very disappointing.

And on the day of our trip, I was able to text both her and her brother, who was going to meet us with the key, updates.  They responded promptly back.\r\n\r\nWe were met in front of the building shortly after we arrived and we were very grateful for the help with our luggage and the working elevator.  (We had forgotten how narrow hallways are in Manhattan apartment buildings.)\r\n\r\nThe apartment gets a good deal of sunlight, which we enjoyed, though you can put down the shades for privacy.  It has everything we needed and lots of things (like the TV) which we never used.  The shower had hot water, the Air Conditioners blew out cold air, and the bed had fresh sheets and was comfortable.  We have both lived in NYC, so we knew that apartments are narrow and storage space is at a premium, therefore, we knew what to expect.  They have done a great job of trying to make as much free space as they can in their apartment, and that was very much appreciated.  They also cleaned out a drawer in the dresser for us and left us a bag of mini-muffins as a Welcome to NYC treat.  We instantly felt at home. \r\n\r\nAnd the neighborhood is wonderful.  Coffee, Bagels, Diners, Grocery stores and Pharmacies, and Restaurants and Bars galore,  are within a short walk of the building.  (Try the Belgian place if you are in the Neighborhood.  Say Hi to Remy for us.)  My wife found a Yoga place a couple of blocks away, and I was able to walk a little ways to Central Park and go jogging.  We were also able to rent bikes from Peddle Pushers (get helmets and a lock) and take them around the city and across into Brooklyn for the day.  Bike lanes are available on 2nd and 1st Ave.  \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, if you are considering this apartment, book it.  The pictures are accurate, the description is accurate, Lauren is pleasant and responsive, and you would be hard-pressed to find a better neighborhood in the city.  We had a fantastic stay and would recommend this place to family and friends.  Not to mention, we would gladly stay again.\r\n\r\nTips:  \r\n\r\nDon't put stuff on the stove, the pilot lights are always on and the top of the stove stays hot.\r\n\r\nShut the door to the office to keep the bedroom cool at night.\r\n\r\nThe shower pressure can take off skin.  I'm not complaining, but be careful.\r\n\r\nThere is no coffee maker, but there is a Dunkin Donuts around the corner, so I was pleased I didn't have to make my own. (There is an espresso machine but it frightened me.)"},{"_id":"14635645","date":{"$date":"2014-06-23T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"602888","reviewer_id":"4411368","reviewer_name":"William","comments":"Lauren and Vincent are a super nice couple.

Toutes les questions qu'on aurait pu se poser avaient déjà leurs réponses !\r\nEnsuite, l'appartement en lui même est plus grand que ce qu'on imaginait grâce aux photos, et super confortable (le lit est génial).

You will be near the harbour and in an entertainment area, therefore there is some noise from traffic and people. When windows and doors are shut there is virtually no noise. However if you like to sleep with your window open there is traffic noise.People who are city dwellers and global travellers claim there is no noise.","notes":"I have a home office, and at times I am quite busy.

She added several nice touches, like fresh fruit in my room that was replenished.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that might be a worry for some folks: this is a downtown location and there's a busy freeway nearby, which could be a problem if you're the sort of sleeper who needs absolute silence. But it's not a worry after all, as Suzie has a supply of earplugs in the bedside table!\r\n\r\nIf you want a chic central apartment to be close to the action, Suzie's got your place."},{"_id":"98933626","date":{"$date":"2016-09-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6046461","reviewer_id":"56146812","reviewer_name":"Nadia","comments":"I really enjoyed staying at Suzie's.

Although she went to work on the day I was leaving she managed to accommodate a reasonable check-out time for which I was grateful for. \n\nThe apartment is exactly as shown in the pictures. There are a number of ornaments, paintings, books etc which add character to the place. The bed was comfortable and spacious with plenty of closet space. Although not an en-suite the private toilet/shower was also very clean and large with toiletries provided. There is a decent balcony area and large lounge/dining section, though I spent most of my time in my room so cannot really comment on this. As mentioned elsewhere, the bedroom is close to a busy highway and so traffic can be heard when the window is left open, and also a little noise can be heard at night when the window is shut...but I managed to sleep through this without an issue.\n\nThe apartment is in Darling Harbour and a few minutes from the ferry stop which can be used to get good views of the Harbour Bridge/Opera House. There are many restaurants/bars/clubs a short walk from the apartment and the main city centre where all the shops are is about a 10-15 minute walk away. After visiting Sydney I personally thought that Darling Harbour was the best location to stay in and would not hesitate to recommend  Suzie's apartment to anyone!\n\nMitul"},{"_id":"130974871","date":{"$date":"2017-02-09T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6046461","reviewer_id":"194229","reviewer_name":"Lauren","comments":"Suzie was a very gracious and friendly host-- she even gave me a tour around the neighborhood when I arrived-- and her apartment was a beautiful space.

Jango was a very gracious host: helpful, friendly, patient, respectful of our time and privacy -- delightful. The apartment is exactly as pictured on this site. The three beds were very comfortable. (The sleeping space is much more appropriate for 3-6 people. We made it work with 8, but it wasn't ideal.) We were also happy with the location: the area is vibrant, with many quaint stores and eateries. On our first night, we were thrilled to find fabulous pizza slices a few doors down and a lovely market around the corner. We traveled with school-age children, so we didn't take advantage of the area's many bars...we feel like we missed out just a little. The apartment is a close walk to the subway (a short block and a half? Quite easy) and Jango gave great directions from the subway station to the apartment. My travel companions all wanted to share accommodations for our trip, and we felt this was a good choice for the price in Manhattan.

The flat was as described: roomy, good beds, comfortable, well decorated, with all things necessary to make our stay very enjoyable! Although everything was fine, the finishing is quite average and the flat would need some work in my opinion. With this being said, Jango was great and even guided me to his free on-street parking space when we checked in and we could leave the car there for free for 3 days! We were travelling with our three young boys and there was ample space for everyone. It was very hot in NYC during our stay and the flat has more than enough AC to cool the place down. The flat's Lower East Side location is fantastic in a very special way and totally worth discovering. Essex market right across the street, subway is minutes away, awesome restaurants next door, public swimming pool a walk away, Nolita, Little Italy right there!

The flat is *huge* for Manhattan -- we were a party of 7 adults and we had plenty of space. The living room was even large enough for us to all sit comfortably, and the bedrooms actually have furniture (i.e., they're bigger than just the size of the bed!). The apartment was clean and well-appointed with anything we needed. It looked exactly like the pictures and description.\n\nThe location is perfect, especially if you want to focus less on tourist attractions and more on getting to know Manhattan. The subway is a few blocks away, and we found a great basement cocktail bar and a few late-nite pizza spots on the block. It's an easy walk to the East Village, Alphabet City, St Mark's, Soho, Chelsea, bridges to Brooklyn, and even Midtown.\n\nJango was a great host! He met us personally to let us into the flat and show us around. He was incredibly accommodating, responsive, friendly, and easy to communicate with.\n\nI will note that the flat is in an old building, like many in New York, and the walls are thin and the floors are creaky. Noise from within the flat and the other units (including a bar/club on the ground floor) traveled pretty freely through the building. This wasn't a big deal for us, since we were out late and sleeping hard, but if you have very light sleepers, early to bed/early to rise-ers, or small children in your party, it's something to be aware of.\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend Jango as a host and this flat as a home base for your NYC adventures.

It was as described and indeed comfy and large.   The three bedrooms were all very comfortable and spacious with plenty storage and hanging space.   The living area was large and had plenty seats for all 5 of us.   The bathroom was large with a bath and shower, although the water did take a while to heat first thing of the day.    We did not use the kitchen a lot but the presence of a washing machine and tumble drier was very welcome.   All in all the apartment was well furnished and very comfortable.\r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood was a mixture of local shops, eateries and bars and not too noisy at night.   There are plenty restaurants in the vicinity including the famous ( but expensive) Katz Diner.   The entrance to the building is small and there are 4 flights of stairs to climb to the flat, although there is a service lift for luggage, which was great!  There is a subway station nearby but you can walk to many downtown attractions if you are keen.(Hint: if you are staying for 6/7 days a 7 day pass on the subway is worth the $30 charge)\r\n\r\nJango was an excellent host who was there to greet us and came over on our departure day to help with luggage.   We had a slight problem with the internet first day which was outwith his control but he kept us updated on the progress to restore which happened on the second day.   He was very helpful and even invited us to stay an extra 2 days free of charge!!   Unfortunately our flights back to the UK had been booked for some time.\r\n\r\nI would certainly recommend staying here for comfort and can highly recommend Jango as a host"},{"_id":"104686455","date":{"$date":"2016-09-27T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6064471","reviewer_id":"3338599","reviewer_name":"Johanna","comments":"We had a great time in New York!

We were absolutely happy about our stay here, but if I have to mention something negative, it would be that it can be a bit noisy especially at weekends, since the outside isnt so well isolated, and there are some bars and Essex street right outside. The stairs up is allready mentioned in the ad, and for us it wasn't a big problem.

We arrived on Thanksgiving afternoon 2017, but it was still no problem meeting up with the host and getting the keys and a quick tour of the apartment.  Each of us got our own room which was perfect.  The apartment is definitely on the larger side for a NY apartment.  Communication with Jango was always quick and thorough.  Unlike my previous AirBnB in NY, this apartment had PLENTY of towels.  Large ones, small ones, and medium sized ones.  None of us had to use the same towel twice and there were still many more unused.  It was great.  And the host was flexible with our late checkout request.  Keep in mind that this apartment is on the Lower East Side so it's not going to be super quiet.  If that's what you're looking for, you probably shouldn't stay in the LES period.

It was exactly what we were looking for! Jango himself is a fantastic and clear communicator. Thank you! \n\n*the lower east side neighbourhood is fantastic! Eateries on every corner, around the corner from the famous Katz deli, bars, shops. Yet has a different feel - more ‘real’ new york to the upper east sides. \n\n*walking distance to Chinatown, little Italy, east village, Chelsea, Washington Square Park and more! \n\n*2 min walk to the uptown subway lines! So easy!!\n\n*2-3 min walk to any subway line actually. 4 stops to 34th street, 5 maybe to Central Park/ Rockefeller. No time at all! \n\n*spacious, 3 bedroom loft. Huge actually! Just as noted in Jango’s pictures and description. All beds extremely comfy and well made up. \n\n*fully functional kitchen \n\n*it is important to note that there are 4 flights of stairs when thinking about getting your luggage up or small children - we did it no hassle and am sure most will be able to if in a fit enough state. \n\n*it can be a little noisy (from above apartment or the bar below)  but it really didn’t bother us! It’s nothing unbearable but worth mentioning for people wanting complete silence.  \n\nThere were 3 couples staying in Jango’s place and it really made our stay! Such a cool place and area of New York City. We could have spent weeks more here!

The apartment is located a short walk from the subway and the area is colourful but not dangerous. \nThe apartment was very clean, and we were happy find it nice and warm in a sub-zero New York. Be careful of the floorboards which gave us splinters - do not walks around barefoot!  The floorboards also mean that you will hear people walking overhead which can be confusing.\nThe stairwell is scruffy and not as well looked after as the apartment itself. There are lots of stairs, but we got used to them. The only problem can be that the lift to the flat is only available if Jango is there so make sure you co-ordinate with him to avoid carrying your luggage.\nThe host, Jango was responsive and helpful. He had to sort out both the blocked toilet and the Wi-Fi within the first 24 hours and responded quickly in both instances. He also let us leave our luggage I the apartment until our late flight which was a real help."},{"_id":"414032091","date":{"$date":"2019-02-18T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6064471","reviewer_id":"35314912","reviewer_name":"Christine","comments":"Overall a bargain in Manhattan for such a big space!  We traveled as 2 parents, 1 toddler and a grandparent for a wedding weekend.  The 3 floors to walk-up are tall floors so if unable to use the elevator for check in/out, be prepared.  The space was clean and fairly accurate to the pictures.  The floors were a little more worse for the wear than I expected from the pictures or description.  My toddler crawled on them but we avoided having him on the bare wood as much as possible to avoid splinters.  \n\nUnfortunately, the weekend we were there, the bar downstairs was very busy and at 4 am on Friday, the bars in the area must have closed because it sounded like the entire bar was outside our window shouting.  We (the parents in the group) were in the front room facing the street and  did not sleep well any night.  I saw this in reviews but some said they didn't hear anything. I guess it just depends on the weekend.  Luckily, our toddler was in the room with french doors which was located in the center of the apt, away from the outer walls.  My mother-in-law in the back bedroom heard thumping from music late at night but did not have loud voices to deal with.  Overall she didn't have major noise issues.\n\nAnother factor to the bar downstairs is the smell.  Fortunately, a very minimal amount of the hookah smell made its way into the apt. My mother-in-law has very sensitive smell and didn't have issues.  You could smell it walking by the door but otherwise it was fine.  Once you stepped into the hallway, the smell was much stronger.  Also, the smell of tequila/liquor at the bottom floor in the morning was quite strong.\n\nOverall, the place is a great value and I would recommend it to a group looking for a budget-friendly place to stay in a good neighborhood.  Be prepared with earplugs if you're in the front room."}]}

All beach towels, coolers, beach chairs, umbrellas, boogie boards and other beach/water accessories were provided and GREATLY appreciated.\n\nMake note that the condo is not air conditioned, but that is VERY common and to be expected at most places in Kona. My group was very excited about the board games, however they were definitely a bit outdated, and missing some pieces. The remotes to the ceiling fans in the living room were a bit confusing and we couldn't figure out the lights (the lamp on the side table wouldn't work) so it was a bit dark at night.\n\nAside from those very small things, this condo was so wonderful for our group and we definitely recommend it to others."},{"_id":"354126585","date":{"$date":"2018-11-30T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"608097","reviewer_id":"180735269","reviewer_name":"Erick","comments":"We couldn't have asked for a better stay!

I have reproduced the same review from our first stay at the hotel:\r\n\r\nOur stay at Sultan's Inn was a wonderful experience. I and my friends chose this place because of all the positive reviews it had received, and our experience corroborates everyone else's reviews! Sultan's Inn is an affordable and well-organised hotel. Our rooms were cleaned and tidied up everyday while we were out, dirty dishes were replaced and clean towels were provided. We never needed to request anything because it was all taken care of seamlessly.\r\n\r\nThe staff at Sultan Inn is very courteous, friendly and professional. They are well-informed about local sights and the ways to reach them. Sometimes their recommendations for guided tours and transport options are more expensive than the alternatives we found by ourselves, but their recommendations were still useful nevertheless. In particular, the hotel's airport pickup service is more expensive than local taxis. But this service was useful for first-time visitors to Turkey like us, since we'd have otherwise found it difficult to navigate our way to the hotel from the airport.\r\n\r\nAlso, the breakfast buffet is one of the best we've ever had, with a really sumptuous selection of foods for every taste! I'm not typically a morning person, but I woke up extra early just to make sure I got a crack at those amazing sausages, boiled eggs, baked potatoes, black olives, creamy yogurt with three different flavours of jams, chocolate brownies, and much more!\r\n\r\nFinally, Sultan's Inn is very conveniently located at the heart of the Sultanahmet district in Istanbul. The area is fairly touristy, and Istanbul's local residents don't frequent it much. But for those of us visiting the city to take in all the famous sights like the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, Topkapi Palace, most hotels in Sultanahmet are a mere 7 to 10 minutes walking distance from all these places. In partcular, Sultan Inn is situated at an intersection with a taxi stand, so for residents in need of private transport, it is very easy to find one right outside the hotel.\r\n\r\nMy only point of dissatisfaction was that the rooms were smaller than we expected. The photographs posted on Airbnb appear slightly 'stretched', giving the appearance that the rooms are longer than they really are. This could be just a function of the camera that was used to take the photographs, but it is worth bearing in mind for visitors who plan to spend a lot of time in their hotel rooms. Sultanahmet is so beautiful that we were barely in the hotel except at night, so it didn't really affect us.\r\n\r\nAll in all it was a good experience, and I would recommend this hotel to anybody visiting Istanbul!"},{"_id":"167036413","date":{"$date":"2017-07-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6081771","reviewer_id":"129364890","reviewer_name":"Daniela","comments":"Great place to stay, helpful staff and just so close to beautiful places to visit.

I have a love affair with New York City but sometimes I need to GET OUT! I've stayed at many B and B's in the Hamptons and New England, but AirBNB seems to be the way to go these days! What else? I'm an avid snowboarder, semi expert dart player and play in 4 different NYC softball leagues, from the Broadway Show league to competitive men's leagues.

The subway is just a few blocks away. It is the perfect neighborhood if you are in NYC for the first time, as we were, and if you like to feel the heartbeat of this great city. It is full of delis, bars, cafes, restaurants and, obviously, theaters. \nWe felt very safe at any time and had no problem walking around alone at night.\n\nThe apartment is even better and bigger than on the photos, tastefully furnished and clean. There is AC, Wifi worked perfectly, the bed is comfortable. Only tiny disadvantage, it is on the 5th floor without elevator and narrow stairs, but that didn't affect our experience.\nFor light sleepers it is recommended to bring earplugs, as AC and the street are quite loud at night. \n\nAll in all we had an amazing week in NYC, not least due to Luke and his lovely apartment!\n\nWe would definitely come back again!\n"},{"_id":"51835274","date":{"$date":"2015-10-24T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6100514","reviewer_id":"429847","reviewer_name":"Jennifer","comments":"We had an absolutely wonderful visit at Luke's apartment!

Tram connects to all important places like taksim, grand bazar, spice market etc.\r\nGrand bazar is 15 mins by walk but it is better to go by tram as station us near apartment.\r\na big super market is just 500 metre near hagia sophia.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nWe were very satisfied with the services, apartment and the location.\r\nIstanbul is awesome. We were there for 3 days but felt that 3 days were very less.\r\nWe will visit turkey again and stay again in the same apartment.\r\n"},{"_id":"35491628","date":{"$date":"2015-06-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6105504","reviewer_id":"34355056","reviewer_name":"Fatima","comments":"Mahmud made us feel very welcome.

His flat is close to anything that is mediaeval in Istanbul. We went to Taksim Sq but were not impressed at all. It's noisy and unruly. Sultanahmet is the place where you can spend days without getting bored. There is so much to see. Mahmud's house is in the middle of all the touristy attractions and yet the lane is sublime and quiet. \r\nTo top it all Mahmud is a non-interfering, 24x7 available host. He is incredibly helpful and amazingly friendly. All four of us spent five nights there and we all felt we had the comfort of home away from home. Thanks very much Mahmud for being a class host.

Everything you need is in his place and if you need anything extra he was just a phone call or text message away. Mahmud, was extremely helpful prior to our arrival. He answered all questions I had, arranged transportation, and provided information on all sites and areas. His place felt like home to us and we look forward to visiting Istanbul again in the future!!"},{"_id":"177164173","date":{"$date":"2017-08-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6105504","reviewer_id":"9995730","reviewer_name":"Soror","comments":"l'appartement est très propre très agréable pratique en plein centre d'istanbul ça nous a permi de passez de bon moment en famille. mahmud un hôte exceptionnel très serviable communicatif c'était super on reviendra."},{"_id":"178669316","date":{"$date":"2017-08-06T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6105504","reviewer_id":"23232362","reviewer_name":"Kimberly","comments":"Perfect location about 5 minutes walking from the Blue Mosque, entrance to Topkapi Palace, and Hagia Sophia.

Сама квартира находится практически в самом центре исторической части города, сюда очень удобно добираться. Махмуд помог нам составить план посещения достопримечательностей, где вкуснее всего поесть, а также где продаются лучшие сладости. Отвечает практически моментально и всегда может подсказать по интересующему вопросу. Также он познакомил нас с ещё одним замечательным человеком Азизом, ресторан которого находится в соседнем здании. Из ресторана открывается прекрасный вид на пролив, а к вечеру там очень тихо и уютно. А уж готовит Азиз просто великолепно.

Mahmud received us and saw us off at the apartment. He had light breakfast and sundries in the refrigerator. Apartment was very immaculately decorated, clean and tidy. The area felt very safe as we  came back very late at night.  Very quiet and peaceful neighborhood. Since it was four of us, we had the entire apartment to ourselves.

It's convenient to walk to the main scenic spots, and it's two or three stops away from here by tram. The house is comfortable, like my own. The landlord also provided us with some food in the fridge, which helped us a lot when we were not used to cooking Turkish food by ourselves. The landlord ended up ordering cars for us, stocking up on books from lonely planet Turkey, and adding more options and detail to our free-wheeling game.

I can't find any more convenient place to stay than this. \n\nMahmud welcomed us at the check in and explain everything you need to know about the place and facilities.

The place is near many good restaurants, bistros and minimarts and there are some street cats visiting the apartment for some cat treats. \n\nLocated on the first floor, the apartment is clean and spacious. It can fit 4 people comfortably and can stretch to 6-7 people. Everything described in the airbnb page is exactly the same as the real place.

Their place is set up for families with small children, which we no longer have, but it was plenty roomy for two adults and two teenagers. Highlights were the kitchen, which was fully equipped with every modern cooking device imaginable, and the patio, where we spent a couple of our evenings. We didn't use the public playground, but it was literally 50 feet from the front door. Parking on their block was generally not a problem.\r\n\r\nThe residence is convenient to the Park Slope neighborhood, shopping (Whole Foods and Lowes are an easy walk), and public transportation (two blocks to the subway, which is a quick ride into Manhattan). \r\n\r\nThe only downside, and this is beyond the control of the hosts, is that the Gowanus neighborhood is a mix of residential and industrial. As a result, there is a fair amount of truck traffic on the street from early morning into the evening. That didn't bother us, but it may be a concern for light sleepers.\r\n\r\nCompared to other places we have stayed in New York, Chris and Samantha's was a real gem!"},{"_id":"17185547","date":{"$date":"2014-08-08T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"610596","reviewer_id":"9690259","reviewer_name":"Gérard","comments":"Christopher and Samantha are very friendly hosts.

(I love that they have a Juicer!)\r\n\r\nThe 5 minute walk to the subway was convenient and while the adjacent streets have commercial businesses we always felt safe walking home in the evening.  The neighbors take care of their property and we often saw people  strolling the sidewalks when we left in the morning.\r\n \r\nChris and Sam’s home is warm and inviting, with plenty of room for my husband, teenage daughter and me to relax after a long day of touring around NY.  We have fond memories of our NY vacation and stay in Brooklyn and look forward to returning.

We ate two or three meals a day in the cheerful kitchen, which was well-equipped and accommodated three people at the counter.  Shopping on foot for food and incidentals was easy, and  we especially enjoyed the neighborhood.  Our visit coincided with the annual Gowanus studio tours, so found ourselves in some of the warehouse spaces that have welcomed artists over the years--spaces that are rapidly getting converted into into condos.  For the moment, Gowanus is a rich urban experience where million dollar row houses share the block with more modest homes and businesses; there are  contrasts and stories everywhere, if you are interested in looking for them.  And finally, our hosts were welcoming and friendly, but inobtrusive.  Cathy and I would love to return someday.  Thank you, Christopher and Samantha.

The home is very spacious with room for our entire family of 5. It was very clean and had everything we needed. I want to add that the bathroom picture on here is outdated; they have remodeled that bathroom beautifully.\n\nThe neighborhood is such a nice mix of residential and commercial buildings. Walking around we would pass anything from tree-lined streets of brownstones to busy retail shops. Everywhere we went felt very safe. We could have stayed within a handful of blocks and had everything we needed. However, there are 3 subway lines within a couple blocks that make it very easy to get anywhere in the city. \n\nCheck in and check out were quick and easy. Chris and Samantha were very welcoming, offering suggestions for places to go in the neighborhood and checking in periodically to make sure we had everything we needed. Lastly, thank you Mason for sharing his books and toys. Our kids really enjoyed having those available. \n\nWe couldn't have asked for a better place to stay and will return every time we visit New York."},{"_id":"148240746","date":{"$date":"2017-04-30T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"610596","reviewer_id":"53152982","reviewer_name":"Camille","comments":"Excellent séjour, nous avons découvert Brooklyn avec grand plaisir.\nProfiter d'une terrasse au calme après avoir arpenté Manhattan est super"},{"_id":"151588708","date":{"$date":"2017-05-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"610596","reviewer_id":"158438","reviewer_name":"Jeab","comments":"This place is one of my most pleasant stay with airbnb.

It can be noisy during the night and early morning due to trucks passing through, but only bothersome if sleeping with the windows open, otherwise it is peaceful. I would also like to say we felt very safe in this neighborhood. There were no concerns or issues walking the neighborhood, even late at night. \n\nThe house. I cannot say enough about the house. The space, decor, and amenities made me wish I could live there. Beds are comfortable, as are the furnishings in the common areas. The kitchen was well stocked for cooking meals. We enjoyed breakfast out on the courtyard, just watching and listening to the birds.\n\nThe only negative, was the unseasonal hot weather, which made for an uncomfortable stay until Samantha had an A/C installed in the master bedroom. Apparently it is common in New York to remove A/C units during winter months and then reinstall for the summer.  Even though we did have this one issue, I would still come back, especially since Samantha and Christopher were so responsive and quick to correct the problem.  \n\nWe are a family of four.  My two young adult sons enjoyed the cool vibe of the home, and the hip bars that were close by. They also enjoyed the freedom of being so close to the subway. I think this is a great place for families with little ones as well as young adults.

One of the major motivators was being in a well-located area of Brooklyn. It was not clear to us that the listing was on effectively a two-level house (with steep stairs), which was not a good fit for our young children (toddler and baby). Had we caught this, we would not have opted for it from the get go. The arrival was very disappointing. We were texted from the host the day before some basic information about the property (access code and how to operate some appliances) but there was no folder containing further explanation. We arrived at 3:30pm and when we entered, the house was very dark and extremely hot (no a/c). Even with all the blinds fully open, it was dark and hot like a cave. In the middle of the day, lights had to be turned on to see. Then, we had the unexpected discovery of the steep steps that were very dangerous for our toddler. Other things that did not help the first impression were dirty dishes left in the dishwasher and dishes washed in the morning in the drying rack not put away. Perishable food items had been left in the refrigerator (vegetables, yogurt, etc.). The porch, shown in the photos as usable was dusty and had constructions materials left on it and would have required a major cleaning effort to leave it a usable condition. The house was orderly but did not feel as if a cleaner had been there (more a once over). We were not happy with the rental as the photos and description clearly show the house differently so we contacted Airbnb to find out about our options since we had a relatively long stay there. Unfortunately, they did not assist and given the last minute nature, there were few alternatives available of an acceptable nature so we were put in a position to basically make the most of it. Here is the summary of the pros/cons of \"Chateau Gowanus\": PROS: --Location: Very convenient. Only two blocks to the subway (F \u0026 R) and Whole Foods Gowanus about 8 blocks away. Also walking distance of Park Slope area along with Cobble Hill \u0026 Boreum Hill with lots of great boutiques and restaurants. Also had one of the best pizzerias we've tasted in NYC (Table 87) which we ordered a couple times while staying there. --Children's Toys: This was a big plus and very appreciated for our kids (age 3 and 8 months). They really enjoyed the story books and toys. --Apple TV: lots of great apps/channels for movies, kids' shows, news, etc. and set up with surround sound. --Spacious, Well-equipped kitchen CONS: --Photos of rental not accurate: no daylight whatsoever. The photos shown of the property quite simply do not reflect the light in the actual home and state of maintenance. The light is akin to being in a cave.

Hawaiian Natives own  the non-private property within the reserve to protect the Native Ohia forest that is sacred to them.

While these species are otherwise very rare they are often seen at the retreat. Researchers continue to identify new species and there is ongoing collaboration to control invasives.   The Ohia Forest has giant ferns, diverse species of orchids, epiphytic plants,  strawberry guava, passion fruit, geckos, praying mantis and songbirds.  The rainforest is very dense and so we ask guests to remain on the grounds for their safety unless we discuss the specific hazards.

The grounds have a distant view of the ocean. The cabin complex is down a long curved private driveway through the jungle,  so it can't be seen from the road.  I forgot that there is a coded gate, so I had to hop the fence and walk down to find Jacklynn's husband to get the code.   \r\n\r\nI'm a building contractor, so I was looking over the construction thoroughly, just out of curiosity.  The cabins are in tip-top shape, with amenities we hadn't counted on, like a DVD player.   We didn't use it, but it could have been handy on a rainy day.  There were also some local guidebooks.  We accidentally took a large Hawaii guidebook from our cabin, but we'll return it, probably today. \r\n\r\nIt's a great base to explore this part of the island, but use your GPS to find the turn-off for Ala-ili Road if you come when it's dark.

The property is about 30 minutes from Hilo. We were able to travel to the Lava flow and geothermal pools during our stay. The cottage was cosy:  a master bedroom , a second bedroom, a bathroom and a small kitchen. The bed in the master bedroom was big and very comfortable. The kitchen has a stove, and a small fridge, but no microwave. The only sink for the cottage is in the bathroom. We were provided with plenty of towels, shampoo and cleaning supplies. The environment at night is like being in the midst of a jungle:  tree frogs croaking and starry skies (when clear)   There were many different trees that were in the property:  avocado, banana and citrus.

The cottage was clean and exactly as represented in the photos, aside from the lines, which they obviously need to change after each guest. There were four in our party, 2 adults, 2 children (15 \u0026 10) and we fit comfortably in the cottage.  My husband and I had our own space, and was able to relax and enjoy peaceful moments on the lanai, while our kids hung out in the living/dining area. \r\n\r\nIt was great to be able to cook breakfast and dinner in the cottage.  Hawaii can get expensive.  There were more than enough kitchen supplies to make cooking easy. Make sure you check the cabinets for seasonings, oil, etc. before you hit the grocery store.  There may already be some essential items there.  \r\n\r\nWe communicated with Jacklynn via e-mail.  There was really no reason to meet with her.  All of our needs were met and we had all the necessities we needed.  When ever I did email her to ask questions, she was quick on replies. \r\n\r\nThe location was perfect for us.  Our goal was to explore the eastern side of the big island and the Pahoa area turned out to be a perfect home base.  We were a hour from the volcano and Waimea.  We found it hard to adjust to the speed limit in Hawaii.  You definitely have to have an island life mindset.  No speeding, no tailgating... etc. :)\r\n\r\nI want to thank Jacklynn for sharing her incredible property with us. We had a wonderful, memorable time at the cottage.  My kids loved Oscar the cat (now they insist we get a cat).  It's an experience I recommend for everyone .. listen to the sounds of nature, appreciate the moment, and just relish in the peacefulness of the retreat. Because during the day, you will be wearing yourself out hiking, snorkeling, zip-lining, etc.. The cottage was our calming sanctuary.  We will definitely return when we get a chance.

The cottage is on a huge property out in the rain forest.

There are also beautiful landscapes and views for sunrises and sunsets. The cottage is fully equipped with shampoo, soaps, towels, and other house hold items. Also, it's pretty close to Volcanoes National Park. \n\nCons: because it is a bit secluded from town, it can be a bit daunting to go out for dinner because it 30 min from Hilo. And there aren't that many places to choose to eat from. Also, you will have neighbors. If you want to be completely alone, this isn't the place for you. Also there is no air conditioning, but that is the majority of places on the island. But we had wet clothes to dry that never dried. \n\nOverall, I did enjoy my stay here and I would stay a here again.

When we came to the end of the small road leading to the cabins I thought we had arrived in an enchanted village!  There before us was a rainbow collection of beautiful little cottages – yellow, blue, green, lavender and even a bright red utility cottage.  They are spaced generously apart so as to provide privacy, on a huge grassy lawn, each differing a bit in size and floor plan.  The lush tropical landscaping, much of it just the jungle fighting to take over was lovely and relaxing. The interior of our cabin was overwhelmingly spacious and gracious and immaculate.  The bedrooms were so comfortable and offered such magnificent views that I didn’t mind at all when my energetic  son occasionally took off for a tour, leaving me to lounge in luxury. Every detail was just what we needed – the small but efficient kitchen provided everything we needed. To top it off, the place had an irresistible resident cat, Oscar.  My only disappointment in our entire stay was that Oscar politely declined the chicken I offered him.  I guess Puna Rainforest Retreat provides him everything he needs, just as it did for us.\n\nMy only reservation in writing this is that I fear it will encourage the rest of the world to swarm to this idyllic place, making our inevitable return difficult."},{"_id":"129244951","date":{"$date":"2017-01-29T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6106370","reviewer_id":"112582327","reviewer_name":"David","comments":"Wonderful, calm remote location.

The entire property is a well cared for Oasis from the world and if you are looking for a private and quite retreat from the hustle and bustle then this is the place for you.  The cottages are nicely spaced and you won't hear your neighbors.  You should probably plan on arriving before the sun goes down as the road may be hard to see, but once you get to the gate, the access is easy and the parking is color coded for each cottage. There is a lovely trail around the property that we enjoyed hiking.  We didn't use the pool, but it looked nice and we did see others enjoying it.  The Lavender Cottage was better than pictured and contained everything that we needed.  The kitchen is small, but has a stove, pots \u0026 pans for cooking and a small fridge/freezer that fit our stay perfectly.  There is only one sink, in the bathroom, but it didn't cause a problem as it had been designed very nicely.  The bed is as everyone else before use described, very soft and comfortable - with the night breezes we slept the entire trip.  The frogs are loud so either turn on the fans or bring ear plugs.  The cottage is in a great location - there is Malama Market (grocery store) down the street (and drug store) that has everything we needed, or Hilo is just a short drive if you want Safeway, Target, etc.  We ate dinner one night at Kaelo's Bar \u0026 Grill in Pahoa - it has great food and drinks (you may want to make a reservation because it's always pretty busy).   If you get a chance visit the Hawaii Tropical Botanical Garden ($15 to get in but well worth it).  Afterwards you are just a short drive to Whats Shakin' a fabulous place to get real fresh frozen fruit drinks and lunch.  These are both on Old Mamalahoa Highway in Pepeekeo just outside of Hilo off Highway 19 (4 mile scenic route).

The wifi is spotty and limited (was disconnected even though had rebooted the device a few times). The shared sink for the kitchen and toilet is interesting and needs some getting used to, do read the listing description as it has given great details.

If you want to experience the beating heart of the Lower Puna eruption, this is *the* place to stay. At the time of this writing, there is no legal area from which to view the lava directly, but there may be one soon. \n\nDespite its proximity to the active fissure, it's totally safe. We came with our baby daughter. Air quality was good thanks to the trade winds, and most of the truly noxious stuff gets generated at the ocean entry point (and then blown off to the west along the coast). Furthermore, Jacklynn has a sulfur dioxide detector, which has shown safe levels the entire time, but the cottage also has an air purifier if you’re still worried.\n\nEven if you can’t see the lava directly, being less than 3 miles from the fissure is incredible. The volcano is continuously generating its own clouds which reflect the bright light of the lava back down to the ground, causing a wide swath of the sky to be filled with an eerie red glow. After baby bedtime, my wife and I sat out on the patio and just stared at the shifting crimson clouds for almost an hour. The coqui frogs make it pretty hard to hear the eruption itself, though occasionally we caught little sounds that may have been lava sloshing in the distance.\n\nOn the retreat property, there are also (as of this writing) a number of steam vents where hot steam is constantly billowing out of cracks in the ground. These are all downwind of the cottages, so their slightly sulfurous odor won’t affect you unless you go exploring.\n\nAnother cool thing: At least when we were there, the entire area from Pahoa down to the retreat had a unique smell that is hard to describe. It’s more sweet than sulfurous, and I miss it now that we’ve left.\n\nAn alternate place to stay would be somewhere in Nanawele estates. You’ll probably get a broader swath of red sky from Nanawele. However, I still think Jacklynn’s place is better: the view from the cottage balcony is amazing, and Jacklynn is a great resource for tips on exploring the area if she’s around.\n"},{"_id":"305747106","date":{"$date":"2018-08-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6106370","reviewer_id":"205465957","reviewer_name":"くみ子","comments":"ﾊﾜｲ島の自然に囲まれた､静かなｺﾃｰｼﾞです｡日中は幻想的なｽﾁｰﾑﾍﾞﾝﾄの風景､夜はｺｷｶﾞｴﾙの合唱との満天の星空を楽しめます｡湿度はかなり高めですが､他では体験できないような生活を楽しむことができますよ｡"},{"_id":"317906808","date":{"$date":"2018-09-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6106370","reviewer_id":"51939903","reviewer_name":"Edward","comments":"Cute place.

Pros:  Apartment was good sized, clean, and maintenance requests were done promptly.  Management company was very polite and professional.  Apartment furniture and kitchenware were adequate, TV and wifi were good.  Very large master bedroom with 3 good sized closets.  Washer/dryer in unit was very convenient.  The patio was a nice size and faces a quiet courtyard.  Neighbors were quiet.  Management company cleans monthly (for the monthly fee) and does an awesome job.  Great neighborhood, almost anything in walking distance.  There is a view from the kitchen window of the Greenwich hotel across the street which allows for good paparazzi and celebrity watching.\r\n\r\nCons:  Air conditioning is only in the bedrooms so you need to keep the bedroom doors open in order to cool the rest of the apartment.  The 2nd bedroom doesn't have a closet.   Heating in the 2nd bedroom is done with a portable heater.  Bathroom is small.  The only closets in the apartment are in the master bedroom.  Building is older, built in the 1970's.  The last few weeks of our stay the management company scheduled several showings of the apartment to potential new tenants.  Access to the apartment is stairs only, (one large flight of stairs outside) we did not have access to an elevator.  "}]}

The house is only 2 minutes from the sea, and we biked around the seaside and riverside, which was perfect for exploring the city and surroundings.

The flat was as described, very nice, quiet, spatious and bright with high ceilings throughout.  The kitchen is well equipped and has everything you need to prepare dinner and we made use of that and spent some evenings at home enjoying the flat and resting from sightseeing during the day.  If you wanted to go out in the evening, the nightlife of Gracia proper is only 10min down the road.  Similarly Sagrada Familia is only about 10 by foot in the other direction.  The nearest tube station Joanic is also 8-10min away.  It's located on the yellow line which is very convenient if you want to go and see the Ramblas, Gothic quarter or El Born.  We can highly recommend the flat and would consider staying there again in the future."},{"_id":"63209842","date":{"$date":"2016-02-21T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6152624","reviewer_id":"12473674","reviewer_name":"Maria","comments":"The apartment was really beautiful and cosy as you can see it from the pictures.

It meant that we couldn't really be in the apartment during the daytime, which we intended traveling with an infant. However, David obviously couldn't do anything to help us with this situation which is totally understandable. David's apartment is spacious, clean and bright and we enjoyed having a drink on the sunny small terrace in the late afternoon.

Excellent location in Gràcia, a quieter village-like area away from city centre but easily accessible via 2 metro stops, Joanic (5 minute walk) and Sagrada Familia (10 minute walk). You can take the yellow line from Joanic to Selva de Mar if you want to go to a less touristy beach. There are plenty of restaurants/bars in Vila de Gràcia to enjoy which has a lively atmosphere at night. I would recommend Gola Taperia. We stayed the 3rd week in August during La Festa Major de Gràcia (200 year anniversary this year) which made the experience all the better as you can wander through the beautifully decorated streets and get a taste of local life.

Everything in the flat worked perfectly never had a single issue or complaint with anything. The flat itself was light and inviting. Good shower and comfy bed. Great open plan kitchen dining room for entertaining. The suburb that it was in was quite and chilled but not too far away from some great bars and restaurants in the local area. It provided a great representation of the local culture of Barcelona which provided a retreat from the tourist hotspots of the city. However when you wanted to get to said tourist hotspots the public transport available from the apartment is perfect: buses to park Guell only 10-20 minutes, bus to camp nou only 30-40 minutes, easy connection to Tibidabo and the L4 metro line from Joanic meant we were minutes away from the city centre and the beach. The icing on the cake was the Sagrada familia only being a 10 minute walk from the apartment. Anyone planning a trip to Barcelona, I would highly recommend this apartment. We may even use it in the future ourselves, if and when we decide to return to the city."},{"_id":"201017628","date":{"$date":"2017-10-07T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6152624","reviewer_id":"135782609","reviewer_name":"Hanne","comments":"Nice and clean apartment.

There are plenty of stores, cafes, and restaurants within walking distance of the apartment, however, we found that we had better experiences with places closer to the center.

It is a bright and very attractive apartment, well equipped kitchen, spacious, comfortable beds, and with the aircon just outside the room, not too noisy at night.  Blinds also kept the place cool for our August stay.  There are good supermarkets nearby.  We recommend a restaurant called A Veiga, just around the corner on Carrer Sardenya, which serves excellent Catalan food and is very good value.    David responded quickly to our requests for information about local facilities and was very understanding when our carelessness resulted in him having to call out a repairer!

After 5 days in BCN I truly believe Gracia is the coolest neighbourhood by far; lively, full of bars, restaurants and shops but still giving you the live-as-a-local experience which I believe wouldn't be the case in Barri Gotic or El Born. Lots of supermarkets and convenience stores a stone throw away, 10 mins walk to Sagrada Familia, a short bus ride to Guell park and 5 mins walk to L4 line metro which gets you directly to the most interesting places. The apartment is stylish, fully equipped, and looks exactly as in the pictures.  The only think to be aware of, is that it is in the 3rd floor instead of the 2nd. Although the floor is typically called Secondo, there is a mysterious mezzanine sort of thing, but still the same deal of stairs to climb.  \nI did not personally meet David but the communication was excellent and the responses quick.

The house is lovely, full of character and in a perfect location about 15 minutes walk from the ferry and 5 minutes from the buses. Balmain is a bustling place, with a multitude of cafes, bars and restuarents. \r\n\r\nThe beds were comfortable, and even though it was the middle of winter we were never cold, in fact when we had the gas fire on it was very cosy indeed. The kitchen is well stocked and a supermarket is less than 5 minutes away. I don't think I could find a fault at all; everything was as described. \r\n\r\nThe only concern would be the steepness of the stairs, common in house like this I imagine, but for a person with mobility issues the upstairs bedrooms could be difficult. The master bedroom+en-suite  and the family bathroom are downstairs however, so it might not be an issue at all. \r\n\r\nHighly recommended indeed."},{"_id":"90756337","date":{"$date":"2016-08-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6170899","reviewer_id":"25740705","reviewer_name":"Christine","comments":"This is a delightful gem cottage in Balmain with easy access to local cafes and walks, and near the city via bus or ferry.

You're not staying in the heart of Maui but you're better off especially if you plan to do any fishing or snorkeling, most of the boats depart walking distance from your unit at the marina.  Only needed to use the AC one day and this was during an unusual hot spell in Hawaii.  Falling asleep to the sounds of the ocean is so amazingly relaxing .  Most places close early so you might want to do some grocery shopping, but Beach Bums BBQ and Ma’alaea General Store \u0026 Cafe are in the marina and totally worth checking out.  We actually missed our flight back to Oahu grabbing food from the general store...and it was worth it!  \r\nYour view from the lanai can't be beat, you have surfers riding the fastest right in the world and sea turtles all right in front of you.\r\n   Our only complaint is the bathroom, there is no fan and the vent does not work great, so pick up some spray or incense."},{"_id":"51698283","date":{"$date":"2015-10-24T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6183610","reviewer_id":"36746940","reviewer_name":"Marie","comments":"Our stay  was fantastic!

Thank you, Ron, for providing a scenic condo at an affordable price!"},{"_id":"171152210","date":{"$date":"2017-07-16T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6183610","reviewer_id":"107905901","reviewer_name":"Ryan","comments":"We stayed at Ron's place for our five year anniversary. The condo is in a great location, a very short drive away from many of the top places to go in Maui. You are walking distance from Maalaea Harbor, where there is a great aquarium and where many of the snorkeling trips depart. From the start, everything with our trip went very smoothly. Ron is a great host who is always available to answer any questions about the condo or Hawaii in general. As others have written, the view from the condo is unbelievable. There's a great sized lanai/balcony to watch the ocean from. We enjoyed many meals on the balcony. The condo complex also has a very nice pool and BBQ area. There's a very nice sandy white beach just a short walk away. As others have said, the easiest way to keep the apartment cool is to open the windows up and use fans. There is a window AC unit near the patio door that cools down the dining/living room area well, but we found that the AC's cooling does not reach the bedroom adequately and it stays fairly warm in there if the windows are not open. With the windows open, a nice breeze flows through the place. Overall, the value you get here can't be beat, nor can the view. We would definitely stay here again and highly recommend the place."},{"_id":"174714550","date":{"$date":"2017-07-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6183610","reviewer_id":"61539927","reviewer_name":"Cat","comments":"The condo we stayed at had a beautiful ocean view, perfect for us as we were on our honeymoon.

We cooked a lot in the kitchen and anything you could think of was already available to use! \n\nThe location was great! Quiet, not too far from other cities/the harbor for doing excursions/airport. There were other residents in separate condos, but you never hear anyone really. The waves of the ocean drown out all noise if there ever was any. \n\nThe balcony was amazing; View of the ocean, mirrors on the balcony walls to make sure you catch every angle of the ocean. It also helped to create an illusion that you were alone in one place. I loved that. Great sunrise views. Turtles every single day! That was so cool! Coffee in the morning watching the sunrise is a must do. \n\nThere was an A/C unit but we never used it, cause when you open all the windows the breeze races through the house and feels great! \n\nHonestly, there were so many positives about this place I can only come up with one negative: Having to leave. \n\nThis is definitely a five star location!

There was all the equipment you would need for snorkeling and going to the beach (umbrellas, chairs, mats, boards). \nIt was hot and muggy at times but we got good air flow with windows and the sliding door open. On the worst day we used the air conditioner.\nThe pool is not very big but it was very nice. There were plenty of chairs and loungers. It was pretty quiet during our time there.

I love travelling, sharing cultures, cinema, music, outdoors activities, food and wine. I have been living abroad for long time and I finally found home in Barcelona. Since I have been enjoying Airbnb as a guest and after I was made redundant I became an host and I do my best to make my guests happy too. If you cannot travel make the TRAVELLERS come to you!  \r\nI Welcome you to come to my place and share it with me, I will give you good tips more as a traveller than a tourist and I will take good care of you. You will live a local experience but just keep in mind that my house IS NOT A CHEAP HOTEL and that I will love you more if you respect my way of living when you are here.\r\nI HATE WASTING so please take a good care of everything I borrow you and do not throw away things we can still use: unused tickets, maps, leaflets, travel guides and recycle as much as possible. Don't waste energy, water, paper, food, etc and keep it clean and neat. If you like consumerism, wasting, do not like recycling and sharing I think this is not the right place for you.\r\nFinally I live in the red light street, so if you don't like to see prostitutes in the street please don't choose my place or if you come do not give me a bad evaluation for the location, location is perfect and they were here before me and you. I am a certified Thai massager do not hesitate to ask me one!\r\nI organize an hike in Montjuic if you want to join book it: Mindfulness walk through Montjuic!

Right from the start, from the minute I made my reservation to when my plane landed she made everything run smoothly and feel so easy. Her instructions we easy and her English is very good! I'm sure traveling used to be much more complicated thank this! I can only put this down to how much effort Tizz puts into making sure your stay runs as smoothly and efficiently as possible. The location of the apartment is so convenient, it's walking distance to the main attractions yet away from the touristy spots so quite safe from pick pockets. We joked that it is safer to have prostitutes around the corner than to stay on Las Ramblas with all the pick-pockets. I felt very safe in this area, with Tizz inside information you will feel like you get to experience a little bit of what it's like to live in Barcelona rather than to simply visit. I believe this is the very premise of what Airbnb was built on! Thank you Tizz, you do such a good job and were so generous.

She was also very responsive, which was much appreciated when one of us got an injury and needed to go to the hospital. The downside was we were told to be extremely quiet and basically whisper or be completely silent whenever we were in front of the apartment or inside the stairwell in order to not disturb the neighbors due to AirBnb regulations in Barcelona. Considering the street was often far louder at night than we were, not really sure if it was really necessary. However, all in all, it was a good stay.

At night it can get a bit loud but it is a major city and it is relatively loud everywhere, and Tiz was super cool and provided ear plugs for me and my girlfriend (personally I didn't need them and always let well).

Turn right - the first restaurant in pink flourescent letters is amazing and cheap! Lovely cocktails for 5 Euros and tapas with a modern twist. \n\nAlso visit the 360 rooftop bar in the big building at the end of the road on the left. \n\nThank you Tizz!"},{"_id":"253804919","date":{"$date":"2018-04-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6184600","reviewer_id":"5532041","reviewer_name":"Marek","comments":"Tizz is very friendly and the appartement is well situated.

My teen daughter, her two friends and I all loved it.  It was spotlessly clean, decorated in a very welcoming, comfortable way, and had everything we needed for our stay.  The kitchen is so pleasant with large windows and high ceilings, perfect to enjoy a cup of coffee in the morning.  The back patio was equally inviting and we enjoyed eating breakfast and dinner there.  The pictures accurately show the apartment but can't quite do it full justice.  The neighborhood also won us over - it is a beautiful  residential street - lots of trees, easy parking (but pay attention to certain sections requiring a residential sticker), and very safe.  Rue Laurier is a 2 minute walk and full of cafes, restaurants, a grocery store, and cute shops.  The metro is about 10 minutes away by foot but a nice walk along Laurier and past the park.  We took advantage of the Bixi bikes at the corner of the block (2 minutes away) and loved exploring the city by bike - made very easy with the bike lanes and attention to cyclists all throughout the city.  Marie-Andree and Stephane could not have been nicer in welcoming us to Montreal and to the apartment.  They were quick to respond to emails before our arrival and waiting to meet us when we arrived - even an hour late after a long delay at the US/Canadian border.  We had to get right back out the door for an event and they were very helpful with metro directions.  It is very nice having them living right downstairs - very convenient if there were any questions.  The next day I texted asking if it was a good time to ask for advice on some sightseeing.  They were out to lunch but sent Marie-Andree's brother over to answer my questions and provide great recommendations.  There was fresh fruit, milk, butter and condiments in the refrigerator, and delicious coffee - very thoughtful and particularly helpful as we didn't have to go to the store right away and were able to enjoy our first morning with the food we brought and what they left for us.  All in all, we loved staying here, highly recommend it and hope to come back to Montreal and stay here again.  Our only complaint was that we couldn't stay another day or two!  Thank you Marie-Andree and Stephane!"},{"_id":"35530155","date":{"$date":"2015-06-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6185608","reviewer_id":"36005449","reviewer_name":"Anabel","comments":"We booked the place at the last minute without any problems and the apartment ready by the time it got there.

We let Marie-Andree and Stephane know we would be arriving later than we originally thought; they would be out, so left a key inside.  Easy.  We found the neighborhood beautiful, and location good.  Parking was easy.  Stephane recommended a great Sushi restaurant (Tri Express) on the corner.  The apartment itself was, for the most part, comfortable. The bedroom, the bed. Plenty of closet space, hangers, surface space to put stuff. Cute kitchen. Cute shared deck with grill (we didn't use it, however). Fans were a welcome thing as it was warm and humid during much of our stay.  What wasn't expected was the  uncomfortable sofa bed: you could feel the bars of the frame whether sitting or sleeping, and the noise late at night from the very heavy-footed upstairs neighbors.  If you are a light sleeper you may also find this disruptive.  Also, the apartment was was very clean, except for the floors which seemed not to have been washed in a while which we noticed from walking barefoot.  I don't like ending on a negative note, so I'll close by saying the hosts were friendly, and responsive.

The apartment is in an older building with lots of historical details, including gorgeous hardwood floors. The bathroom, while small, is well appointed, and the kitchen is excellent.

Tout près du parc Laurier où des installations sont présentes pour les jeunes enfants. \n\nIl manque un peu d'espace dans la cuisine pour y manger à 4, mais l'endroit est très chaleureux et accueillant. Nous avons deux enfants de moins de 4 ans et tout était bien adapté: nous n'avions pas à rendre l'endroit \"kid-proof\".

Our first impressions were very good: clean, calm, modern bathroom and kitchen, ... . There were two bathrooms, one outside and one upstairs, with shelves for our stuff - very handy! The kitchen was large and fully equipped. However, in the 'value for money' department, we did hit some minor bumps. First of all, despite there hadn't been any guests staying in our room the day before our arrival, we found 3 bags of garbage in the corner. Also, our personal shelf in the kitchen cupboard and refrigerator had not been emptied. While these things may be considered the responsibility of the previous guests, we expected the owner to have done at least a quick check. Furthermore, every evening there would be quite alot of creepy crawlers on the kitchen counter and under the appliances. We informed the owner of this and he responded immediately, saying that he would send someone to check it out. Sadly, the bug problem persisted until our departure. Finally, our room and the room of our neighbouring guests were separated by wall-sized collapsable closet doors. This essentially meant that, sound-wise, we simply seemed to share a room and had to be very quiet as to not disturb eachother. While we did have a pleasant first AirBnB experience, we have to admit we had expected a bit more value for money."},{"_id":"42916624","date":{"$date":"2015-08-16T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6201263","reviewer_id":"2780020","reviewer_name":"YunJoo Karris","comments":"Location was great.

Beautifully furnished and with a small garden.\n\nDue to a window in the kitchen and the bedroom there is always a nice cool breeze flowing through the apartment which makes it cool despite it being hot outside. Really confortable to stay in and in a nice location to reach everything, supermarket right in front of the entrance.\n"},{"_id":"310103017","date":{"$date":"2018-08-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6214138","reviewer_id":"7405995","reviewer_name":"Jose Antonio","comments":"Ilham foi muito atencioso e educado.
