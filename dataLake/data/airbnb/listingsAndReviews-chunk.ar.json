Carlos even pre-arranged a cab for us from the airport as we did not know our way, especially so late at night. The only problem was we couldn't get in to the apartment for a good 10 minutes as we had trouble getting the door to open, the lock in the door kept on turning but we just couldnt push open the door. We manged to get in after 15 mins of trying and tried to call Carlos but as he was out he couldnt hear it. He did get back to us within 20 minutes which was not too bad. Apartment is nice and small, toilet door entrance is very narrow, so dont stay here if you are on the bigger side... Another low point was the noise at night, we could barely sleep with the students shouting outside. He got us some fruits, juice and water inside the apartment which was very nice of him.

Die Kommunikation mit ihm funktionierte immer super und schnell und die Wohnung war wie beschrieben. Es standen uns genug Handtücher, zusätzliche Decken, sowie auch Wasser und Obst zur Verfügung. \nLeider kann ich aber keine bessere Bewertung abgeben weil wir während unseres ganzen Aufenthalts froren, da die Isolierung der Fenster so schlecht ist, dass es uns nicht möglich war die Wohnung genügend zu heitzen (Carlos stellte uns zwei Heitzstrahler zur Verfügung). Bei dem Versuch hatten wir diverse Stromausfälle. \nAußerdem brach der Wasserhahn im Bad ab (verrottet). Carlos hat uns aber immer sofort Hilfe angeboten und sich für die Unannehmlichkeiten entschuldigt.\n\nDie Lage ist super, sehr zentral. Die Küche spärlich aber auf jeden Fall ausreichend und die Wohnung generell sauber und nett eingerichtet.\n\nZu einer anderen Jahreszeit als im Winter könnte ich die Wohnung mehr empfehlen!"},{"_id":"217406802","date":{"$date":"2017-12-09T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19170546","reviewer_id":"158098450","reviewer_name":"Tommaso Antonio","comments":"L’appartamento ci è piaciuto moltissimo, molto ordinato pulito e funzionale.

The larger towns of Hilo and Kona, each with international airports, are both approximately one hour away. For the most part the closest place to grab a bite is Honokaa. (\"For the most part\" because there are sometimes roadside food places open during the day closer to Waipio. Also, the Waipio Cookhouse is now open for lunch and dinner: Farm to table casual dining. Just 0.75 mi up the road. Try it out!) Our quaint neighborhood is remarkably safe.","notes":"It rains here on occasion...bring a rain jacket or poncho if you own one. We can also dig up extras if needed though. A 4-WD is helpful if you plan to explore all that Waipio valley has to offer. Of course, it can be done on foot as well. Sometimes we drive down for a surf, swim, or hike. If so come along and hitch a ride! Volcano/Lava/Vog-  You're safe and in a great location here. We are 55+ miles from any lava flows, and enjoy the cleanest air on the entire island typically because of our northern/windward location.  Coqui frogs - they are certainly a presence after dark and can be boisterous little guys at night. White noise for some, more bothersome for others. If likely the latter, consider white noise apps and/or ear plugs to drown out the nature. Earthquakes - we occasionally have some small tremblers!","transit":"Car is best, but buses are reliable into Honokaa from Kona/Hilo sides. From there you'll need a ride though. Plenty of people hitchhike (including ourselves).","access":"Access is to the entire guest suite, adjacent to but completely separate from our main home.","interaction":"Happy to greet you and show you in if you so desire.

Being so close to the valley was such a privilege and you really feel how special this part of the world is. The flat is a short drive into Honokaa where you can get all your basics and enjoy the heritage of the area. Waimea is a larger town and is less than 20mins away with plenty of dining options.  We also explored Hawi (North) and the West Coast from here which were all within a 90min drive.\n\nHonokaa is a very friendly town and we enjoyed staying within a community of people who clearly love and respect their environment. I don't think we have ever seen an area so lush and green and a sky so full of stars!\n\nWhile the flat is annexed to the main house we had complete privacy. Being part of nature, there were quite a few mosquitos but bring bug spray and you will be fine. The flat is a bit light on cooking equipment but there is a BBQ and  take away options nearby. \n\nMake sure you walk down to the Waipio Valley. A horse riding trail is another way to experience this unique landscape and something we thoroughly enjoyed.\n\nErik and Amy were wonderful hosts. Their garden was full of amazing local fruit which we were encouraged to share and they left fresh juice and fruit for us which was a nice treat. Communication was easy and swift.\n\nI wouldn't hesitate recommending Erik and Amy's place. Whether you want to relax, experience the local culture and immerse yourself in Hawaii's spectacular landscapes or get out and horse ride, hike, swim/snorkle, this place has it all."},{"_id":"222092856","date":{"$date":"2017-12-28T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19178913","reviewer_id":"159152643","reviewer_name":"Vincent","comments":"As this was our first BnB experience Erik and Amy made it a great one.

The hospitality alone made it worth it from lightning fast responses for all our questions to sharing local spots to vist to fresh OJ from their trees.

In fact, Maureen reached out to us to let us know of Santa's arrival via an outrigger canoe because she knew the kids would enjoy it.\n\nMaui Revealed is the best travel guide I've read and has some unique places to stop and visit; do yourself a favor and pick up a copy before you come; if not, there is one in the condo.\n\nIn summary, great condo, great location, great hosts....what are you waiting for?"},{"_id":"129580303","date":{"$date":"2017-01-31T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1920293","reviewer_id":"14717247","reviewer_name":"Alize","comments":"Maureen was a fantastic host.

Very hospitable. We only stayed two nights to see the sights, events and nightlife they had going on in Montreal that weekend. The room is great size for a couple has closet and its own washroom. The kitchen is quaint and clean. \n\nHe even gave us a continental style breakfast the morning after our first stay. He did not have too but it's just a testament of how hospitable he is. The room is literally next to the laundry room and pool as listed. The view from his balcony is great. You're right in the centre of Montreal near shopping ball, restaurants. His place is right next to a stall of Bixi bikes for those who like a little workout in the morning.\n\nThere is a fan in the room but it never really gets hot considering the draft coming from the balcony.\n\nCommunication-wise Jeremy is very efficient. He responds within 5-15 min. Mind you, you barely see Jeremy unless you have a question or you see him doing upkeep on the place which is nothing against him but it shows that you kind of feel alone in the place which is nice and is probably the idea he was going for.\n\nAll in all I would stay here again and probably will."},{"_id":"178518115","date":{"$date":"2017-08-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19220115","reviewer_id":"8181352","reviewer_name":"Paul","comments":"An absolutely amazing apartment and host.

When the home was booked there was air conditioning, parking at the property and amenties (just bring toothbrush). We found out 2 days before check in that there is no parking now at the property, no air conditioning during winter months and laundry only between 6-9pm. All of these would have been ok of that is what the ad said when I booked the home. So the host just changed all of this and never notified me. I would not have rented if this was the case as all of those things are very important to my family during vacation. We were provided a half roll of toilet paper for each bathroom and then had to buy all of our own amenities. No shampoo as listed and 5 towels for 5 people and no extra bedding or pillows at all. Guests are responsible for putting out and away the garbage cans from the curb. All of the rooms had ceiling fans but the remotes are not provided so you are not allowed to adjust them in some of the rooms. Once again the home was in a great location but if booking please make the host accountable for his ad as he does not want to be held accountable for the false listings he did when we booked."},{"_id":"222819699","date":{"$date":"2017-12-30T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19221893","reviewer_id":"7432227","reviewer_name":"Ray","comments":"The place was very clean and well maintained.

The condo is spacious and tastefully decorated.  We really liked the single level space, where every room had privacy, its own bathroom, but the common areas were a welcoming gathering spot that had plenty of room for all of us to be together comfortably.  \n\nThe Kolea complex is among the very best locations in the Waikoloa Beach area, and Gayle's condo is among the best located within the complex itself, just across the street and slightly down from the beachfront pool area. The pool area itself has a wonderful view to the sea, lots of sitting and sunning area, and is connected directly to \"A-Bay\" beach by a short sand path - really fantastic!   A-Bay is a very popular beach where you can rent anything you want for water fun, or just hang out and enjoy one of the prettiest and most beaches in the area.   Most of the best beaches on the Big Island are within a 15 minute drive if you are inclined to go explore.   Gayle also leaves an access card and parking pass for the nearby Hilton for guests to use if they wish - the Hilton has huge watefront pool and waterslide which is over the top fun for young children (its a 15 minute walk, or a couple minute drive from the condo).\n\nThe lanai in this condo is very big, and opens onto a southwest facing semi-private grassy garden area.  The exposure is very nice.   Our family loved this indoor / outdoor space when we were hanging out in the morning or evening.  The entire wall of windows between the living area and the lanai open up to create a great big open living space and there is plenty of comfy outdoor furniture and a good size dining area outside.   Or you can hang out inside with the entire front of the condo open.  \n\nThe kitchen was well-stocked with cooking equipment and basic supplies, spices, sauces, etc., and worked very well for our family of six.  There is also a nice outdoor kitchen on the lanai with a separate fridge, sink, and large gas BBQ.   We enjoyed grilling dinners out there. \n\nWe appreciated the boogie boards and plenty of large beach towels.  We brought our own snorkelling gear, but there appeared to be a mixed supply of enough snorkelling stuff in the unit for a few children and adults if you don't have your own.  \n\nThere is a lovely lava trail along the waterfront surrounding this complex, past the beach area, that we found to be incredibly beautiful - you are likely to encounter sea turtles sunning themselves here!   The complex, unlike most in the Waikoloa area is actually located RIGHT on the waterfront.    That is really unbeatable.  And it is located within walking distance of shops and groceries at King's Market and Queen's Market which is very convenient.  Most places up and down the Kohala coast require a drive for pretty much any supplies you will need, but from here you can walk to everything you need within 10 minutes or so.   We really liked that.  \n\nThe Lava Lava beach club is a 5 minute stroll down the A-Bay beach.  Our family loved this place for lunch, an afternoon drink, or dinner.   It is a great place right on the beach your table will likely be sitting on the sand!  Good food, great service, and lots of fun outdoor games in the adjoining grass area - fun for all ages.   So nice to have a place like this nearby.  There are also other dining options within walking distance, but this one was our favourite and we found it to be a real gem among all the options up and down the Kohala coast - and even better that it was just a short walk down the beach.  \n\nGayle's condo got the thumbs up from our entire family for our first visit to enjoy and explore the Big Island!"},{"_id":"402530208","date":{"$date":"2019-01-18T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19241544","reviewer_id":"3179205","reviewer_name":"Sam","comments":"We loved our stay here.

There is also a small shop in the same building where you can buy basic things. If you are traveling with children it is also perfect place.  Luisa provided baby cot and feeding chair. She also bought some blankets for us and for the kids so that we were not cold at night. She even had some candles for us as she knew that with 2 little kids the only option for romantic dinner is to organize it in the apartment:) When our son got she found a doctor and was extremely helpful!

The adjacent Crystal Palace park is an excellent escape from the bustle of the city whilst the city center or banks of the river Douro are only a 15 minute walk away.

There was a hot plate, microwave, coffee maker, full size refrigerator, and toaster oven along with utensils, plates and bowls, and cookware too. The neighborhood is nice and if you want to golf there's a golf course right across the street. There isn't AC so keep that in mind if you're not used to the hot, humid weather of Hawaii, but a nice shower after a long day of hiking and beaching helps and a couple of beers on the lanai will probably help even more. And the beach isn't far and the best beaches, in our opinion at least, were on the north side of the island. For other rendezvous, it's about a 30 minute drive to the east side, 1 hour to the south, and 1.5 hours to the west side. \n\nJack lives next door and is very kind, helpful, and pretty laid back. Our baby got sick and was super cranky so I'm sure Jack and his family were not overly enthused about listening to her cry constantly, but he never mentioned a word about it (so sorry and thank you for being so cool!).  He was quick to respond to our requests as well. I'm sure he'll take good care of you if you end up booking the studio.\n\nThanks again, Jack.

We cooked all our own meals with the burners and toaster oven which worked fine, just know it’s not a full kitchen. There were a few things missing here and there but Jack was very responsive and left the outside the door. We would’ve loved a blender to make smoothies! So much good fruit at the farmers markets. The pool and hot tub are really beautiful and a nice place to swim, even when it’s rainy. \n\nPrinceville isn’t much other than a golf course and some expensive hotel restaurants, but it is pretty central for getting around the north side of the island. And the view and sunset from Happy Talk lounge is outrageous. Highly recommended."},{"_id":"230044271","date":{"$date":"2018-01-26T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19265750","reviewer_id":"9724148","reviewer_name":"Danielle","comments":"This was a great place to start and end a day of adventuring.

When it comes to the space there are some things you should know: there is one sink in the studio that is by the bathroom (no kitchen sink), the stove top burner was located outside in the lanai and is hooked to a power strip which was exposed to the rain during our stay and would often shortout when in use, dishes are kept outside in a cabinet and so I would wash them before use, the only surfaces to use to eat are two folding TV trays, and lastly, the walls are VERY thin... we heard the hosts baby crying through the night (he was recovering from pneumonia) and heard a very disturbing fight that neighbors were having (twice) and almost called the police because it sounded like a domestic violence situation - my wife is a survivor of domestic violence was a very triggered. There is only one picture of the interior, so thought I would list the details that surprised us.

I mention this because, as others have pointed out, you can hear what's going on in other units in the complex, so it can be a bit noisy at times. I also didn't do any cooking in the apartment, but the lanai does have a burner and toaster oven.

The one thing worth mentioning for those looking for peace and quiet - there is a fair amount of noise from the neighbour's children early in the morning. In the evening after 7pm it was nice and quiet. \nWe found the place easily with the check-in instructions, and it was also very easy to follow the instructions for garbage and recycling disposal. There is a nearby pool and hot tub that guests can use also, which is a nice perk.\nThe space does not have a dedicated kitchen, however, the owners have provided a few nice touches like a coffee maker, microwave, toaster oven, and full size fridge. The toaster and coffee maker are outside on the deck (which is where we liked to eat meals and drink coffee anyways). There are some basic dishes for meal prep to be found in the unit also.

My friends and I arrived to NY way before the check-in time and he still allowed us to drop our bags off and get settled. In addition, his conversation was great! Giovanni is very funny and willingly gave us tips on places to go and went the extra mile to contact family members for suggestions as well. He responds to messages in less than a minute every time and stayed out of our hair during our visit. The place is nice also. We were out and about so we did not use many of the appliances but the kitchen is up to date. The bathrooms were acceptable too but on the main floor bathroom, the drainage in the sink was slow but it wasn't anything we could not deal with. The shower on the main floor's pressure is weak too so we preferred to use the basement bathroom for showers; that one works very well! Aside from this, Giovanni did an excellent job with providing clean linen, giving suggestions, and making sure we were comfortable. I would definitely stay here again if I visit NY in the future. \n\nOh yeah, there was 5 of us and we slept very comfortably with the space provided (there were 2 beds, an air mattress, and a sofa bed). There's street parking as well but it was VERY easy to park whenever we returned from being out."},{"_id":"206257437","date":{"$date":"2017-10-24T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19271040","reviewer_id":"137924651","reviewer_name":"Kathy","comments":"it was a nice place to stay, its a verry friendly man and gives you a good feeling ,highly recommended!"},{"_id":"210288017","date":{"$date":"2017-11-08T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19271040","reviewer_id":"77888194","reviewer_name":"Isabelle","comments":"Giovanni est très accueillant et prévenant.

My daughter near Prospect Park was 30 minutes or so. Highly recommend an unlimited use metro pass.  We noticed the use of bikes \u0026 bike rental in the neighborhood seemed much higher than in daughter's.  \n\nCoffee shops, bodegas and restaurants abound.  The neighborhood is clean and lively. The grocery store by the Kinsgston Throop station was great.\n\nGiovanni let us drop off luggage and check in early, gave us lots of recommendations and asked us to contact him for anything, and Briana from downstairs was very kind and offered help if we needed anything.\n\nTurns out we didn't- it was a magic apartment!

We did not know a whole lot about the neighborhood and glad we stumbled upon a less touristy, beautiful and full of character part of Brooklyn. \n\nWe traveled with a 14-month toddler and that means logistics. Giovanni went above and beyond helping me to arrange a comfortable space for the little one, I shipped the pack-and-play and baby food, Giovanni set-it up for us to ensure it was ready upon arrival. He also made sure we had tons of cozy blankets, there was no shortage of them. :)\n\nSpace itself is very accommodating for a group or a family of 4-5 people. New York spaces can be quiet tight, contrary to that, Giovanni's ground-level space in a brownstone building is quite spacious, has a marble counter kitchen with basic kitchen tools you may need during your stay.\n\nAlthough it rained most days when we were in Brooklyn, we managed to step out and explore the neighborhood and found a couple of awesome dining spots, including LunAtico and Saraghina.\n\nGreat place if you wish to branch out and explore the real Brooklyn!"},{"_id":"324660586","date":{"$date":"2018-09-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19271040","reviewer_id":"175120356","reviewer_name":"Chevy","comments":"Giovanni is a great guy, really accommodating and let me check in early.

It is about a 5 minute walk to the C train entrances, uptown C train will take you up through Times Square and Downtown can take you right over to Brooklyn Park.

I chose Miguel's apartment for its convenient location directly across from Exponor. I took the 601 bus from the airport which for a fare of just EUR 1,90 dropped me off at Exponor. Miguel kindly met me there to bring me the keys. \n\nThat evening I walked to his apartment, circling the Exponor grounds and crossing a bridge over the highway. Each day that I was there I was able to walk to the conference center and back within 15 minutes. I once took a taxi into Porto city center and it was very quick, the fare was about 10 EUR.\n\nMiguel's apartment is in a modern residential building. The 1-bedroom apartment is spacious, well equipped, comfortable, tastefully furnished and impeccably clean. I found a welcome note with clear instructions to connect to the wifi and to use the big-screen TV (lots of channels), as well as tips about local shops etc.\n\nBecause the building is located along a major highway there is traffic noise which may disturb some people, but I did not find it too bothersome as the sound is continuous like rain. The bedroom is on the opposite side facing a quiet residential neighborhood so I was able to sleep with the window open. \n\nI enjoyed my stay and would recommend Miguel's place to anyone attending Exponor or to people with a car given the convenient location near Porto and near the beaches of Matosinhos."},{"_id":"173498118","date":{"$date":"2017-07-23T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19310295","reviewer_id":"24417439","reviewer_name":"Jolanta","comments":"There is a magical place with the unusulal Owner.

The cleaning fee you are charged covers the cleaning bill of the room once you leave.  This fee does not cover any cleaning during your stay.  Also, if you are between the age of 20 and 30, please know that this is not a dorm; it's my home.  The expectation is that guests maintain a decent level of cleanliness, tidiness and respect.  2.  Please know that I have a rescue dog.  Her name is Linda and she will not bother you; she doesn't jump on people. 3.  KITCHEN:  The kitchen is available for you to make light meals.  NOT INCLUDED: the stove.   3.   VALUE:  My apartment is located in Lincoln Square and this is an expensive, upscale area.

While most of my guests have been truly superb, I have, unfortunately, also had guests whose idea of clean, neat and respectful are very different from mine.

Unfortunately, the Hotel Association along with the City of New York have been fighting the existence of Airbnb in NY for years.  In fact, Airbnb is now suing the city of New York.

I understood that the host would sleep in her ‘home office’ if this was the case, however, did not anticipate it to be the lounge area with a screen for privacy, about 2 meters from the kitchen. This made it very awkward making/getting food or being outside of the room in general as not to disturb - having to be overly cautious about sounds and light. The host was vary particular about how things were kept and operated - this included such things as strict recycling regime and wearing slippers or jandals inside- so if you aren’t prepared to accomodate then perhaps reevaluate. \n\nAlso the rooms were definitely not soundproof as I could hear my tv through the wall to the kitchen, which was just something to be aware of. \n\nOverall, a lovely building and apartment however, not going to be ideal if you are uncomfortable in more shared spaces especially for the price.

Also, the walls are not soundproof as you could hear the TV from the kitchen. \n- The host is very particular about her house rules and can be overbearing at times. She has a very strict regimen and if not followed, can result in a lot of tension. \n- A package I had shipped to the address was thrown out and trashed and then returned without any compensation for the lost items (Approved to have it shipped there)\n- I was told I would be charged for overusing the AC even though it was supposed to be covered in the rent\n- I was not made aware that the host in the living room. It made getting and making food very awkward.\n- The owner had renovations done to my room while I was away, and the room smelled of a strong paint odor (although she said it was water-based paint, I was not made aware of any painting to be down prior to the renovations, and I had to sleep in that room the same day it was painted)\n\n\nOverall, the room was very nice. If you are not going to be in the apartment much, and only need a place to stay at night, I would recommend it. If you are uncomfortable in a shared space, I would not recommend it at all.

Their location is so convenient to getting around Manhattan either by subway or walking.\r\nAna is a great person. She loves sharing her favorite places and eating hang-outs.  She had very good non-touristy recommendations.  She always was available to us if any questions or issues arose.  Don’t ever hesitate to rent from Ana and Kathie!

The apartment is cozy, clean and the shower is wonderful, actually is more a water massage than a shower, due to the water pressure. The apartment's view is amazing, I woke up in the morning with the view of Manhattan and Brooklyn Bridges and the sunset shining bright, simply awesome. I also had the opportunity to meet Ana's Dad, an experienced gentleman with vast culture, both of us spoke Portuguese (my native language) and Spanish. The best thing was to exchange life experiences, with nice and educated people.\nI definitely recommend staying at Ana's place. Thank you Ana and Kathie for a memorable experience.

People live there, but it is always clean, the room easy fits two if you don’t need a lot of space. I basically have nothing to complain about. \n\nOnly thing is that their management seems to be a bit difficult at times - I would call it a guarded building basically. There is someone downstairs checking who comes and leaves, so be prepared there might be complications. Ana was always helpful getting everything to work, however this makes me give 4 stars. Nothing really personal, but it’s just a matter of fact. \n\nThe Rooftop is, and I can’t emphasize this enough, amazing. Really not kidding, you won’t find better in Lower East if you are not willing to spend triple the buck. \n\nI enjoyed some quick conversations all the time. Apart from a dinner where Ana cooked for me (make her show you her Impanadad, they are awesome) we didn’t hang out too much.

Living there for 6D5N I do feel at ease staying there but still have to be careful. Auntie Lai who was hosting us is very nice and friendly. I would definitely recommend this apt to others and stay again when I visit HK again. The place is quite small I would recommend 2 persons stay than 3 persons.

My friends and I enjoyed using this place as a home base during our trip to Montreal. One thing you should consider (if using a car in the winter) is asking if parking will be available before you arrive. Since parking was in the title of the listing, I assumed we would have parking during our stay. Yet, the parking spot was not cleared when we got to the AirBnB. We were eventually allowed to park in the neighbor's spot. I recommend just asking before you arrive if off-street parking will be available during your trip."}]}

It's great because you get to stay in a classic Montreal building and you're a block away from Saint-Catherine St.  The metro is a really short walk and it really helps to get around the city.  The place itself was spotless when I walked in, and really comfortable for 1 or 2 people.  The bed was comfy, I slept well every night.  The shower is great with good water pressure, same with the sink.  The front door takes some getting used to, but once you get the hang of it you'll be ok.  I would definitely stay there again.

The walk in either direction to each public beach access is half of a block and there is no need to cross busy South Kihei Road when walking to them.  Connecting these two beaches on the ocean side is a lovely green lawn elevated over the water providing a perfect setting for watching nightly sunsets.  Cove Park is the premiere spot in Kihei for surfing and stand-up paddling, and the entry area for this calm ocean inlet is also located a half block away at the north end of the street.  The neighborhood street Iliili Road is only about two blocks long and contains only homes and vacation rentals, no large resorts, so it is relatively quiet yet well located for enjoying easy access to a ","notes":"There is a free shared Wi-Fi internet connection for this apartment, (subject to rare but possible outages, like any other internet services that can go down...) The name of the wireless network and password are provided on a card inside the apartment.   In the living room there is a Large 55-inch 4K flat screen TV plus a DVD player. While the interiors of the apartments are updated and modern, the property is a basically a private no-frills residential-style building with no pool or hot tub or bbq grills. There is a laundry room onsite which has coin-operated washing machines and clothes dryers, $1 per wash and $1 per dry.  The laundry room definitely has that old-school utility room look to it.  The grounds and the building may be subject to occasional maintenance aimed at improving the exterior look of the property, including weekly visits from a landscaping crew and quarterly visits for standard pest control treatments.  In an effort to \"go green\" using renewable energy sources, an","transit":"The condominium apartment building is located on the short residential Ili`ili Road away from the bustle of busy South Kihei Road, yet is located within very easy walking distance to scenic beaches, the best surfing and stand-up paddling spot in Kihei, plus excellent restaurants, bars, shopping, food stores, surfboard and paddleboard rental shops, bicycle rentals, scooter rentals, and more. Taxis and Airport Shuttles can easily find this road and the bus stop for public transportation on the Maui Bus is only a block away on South Kihei Road. Public transportation also is convenient for riding to Wailea, Makena, or further away to Maalaea, Kahului, or Lahaina.  La Perouse Bay, which features an impressive landscape dominated by Maui's 500-year-old lava flow, is also a great drive to take when driving past the resort areas of Wailea and Makena. To explore a wider range of destinations on the large island of Maui, a rental car is highly recommended for comfort and convenience.","access":"Both check-in and check-out are easy breezy for this apartment.

The closest beach is amazing, I think it was the best swimming beach we went to during our whole trip to Maui. The main cons of the place is that the wifi didn't work that well, the front patio area could be a lot nicer, and it gets stuffy pretty fast, even with the A/C on.

Overall, we spent as little time at the condo as possible because it wasn't that comfortable."},{"_id":"254952997","date":{"$date":"2018-04-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19366111","reviewer_id":"63930968","reviewer_name":"Annelies","comments":"Thomas was a great host, communicated well and made sure our stay was comfortable.

So gracious. The location is incredible since it’s very centrally located, and you don’t have to travel very long to get to major shopping centers or really anywhere on the island.

There is plenty of free parking around for anyone who does rent a car. The apartment is clean, comfortable, and has everything you need. It was awesome having access to beach chairs and a cooler. As well as three great swimming beaches, within walking distance you can find a taco truck, outdoor rollerskating rink, delicious frozen coffee, fresh seafood, a supermarket, and markets with locally made products. The sound of the air conditioning was the only one small negative aspect to my stay. I'm a light sleeper, but if you're not it probably won't cause you any bother.

We loved our stay at Alex \u0026 Noelva’s! The apt itself is very clean, comfortable and was the perfect size for the 2 of us. \r\n\r\nNoelva greeted us upon arrival and showed us around the apt. Every morning we had our coffee and breakfast on our private patio overlooking the water and we tried out some of the local restaurants for lunch and dinner which were great. We particularly enjoyed Black Whale \u0026 Bistro SK.\r\n\r\nAlex \u0026 Noelva are truly gracious hosts. So friendly and welcoming. They allowed us to take their canoe out on the water which was really fun. We enjoyed a beer with them in the front garden we even spent a couple hours with them one day which was one of our favourite parts of the trip. We canoed with them out to their private island and spent some time out there taking in the beautiful views, having some snacks and a few beers. We are so grateful to them for inviting us on such a unique experience.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to returning to City Island sometime soon and would definitely recommend this airbnb!\r\n\r\nA couple additional notes which may be helpful for guests:\r\n-bed linens and bath towels were very clean. Sometimes when you rent you are worried about the provided linens, but they were great here so you don’t have to worry about that. \r\n-the bathroom is updated and the water pressure in the shower is great – very refreshing shower\r\n-they also provided 2 beach towels\r\n-I used their provided hair dryer which helps with keeping your luggage lighter\r\n-their air conditioner is very strong and if it’s really hot cools down the apt quickly. But we mostly used the ceiling fans and open windows which kept the apt nice \u0026 breezy \r\n-Super convenient ride from Manhattan – took us about an hour from Grand Central. Subway to Pelham Bay Park and then quick bus ride to City Island. The bus drops you off right by the street of the apt.\r\n-if you feel like a day just at home in the apt, the tv is really big and great quality. Lots of channels including movie channel and hbo\r\n-the grocery store and the wine/liquor store are just down the street so you can buy things for the apt. and as mentioned lots of restaurants to try out on that main strip of the island all very close by"},{"_id":"19500838","date":{"$date":"2014-09-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1936633","reviewer_id":"20407696","reviewer_name":"Mike","comments":"I am still in a happy, stunned state--this place is PERFECT.

City Island is small but has everything you would need, including great restaurants (seafood, Italian, French), a supermarket, deli, Baskin Robbins ice cream.

The host even invited us for a barbecue! \r\n\r\nThe accommodations were very good, just as shown in the photographs.

No século XX começam a surgir os palacetes com os seus belos azulejos, que abrigavam a Burguesia portuense e casas de funcionários das fábricas. É na Rua do Bonfim, nº 234, um prédio dos anos 50 que hoje dá lugar ao Bonfim 234 Townhouse.

I stayed at this little large room with a double bed, two dressers, and a mirror on the wall. There was a bedroom chair, a coat hanger and one of the best matrasses I’ve ever slept on – one could easily hibernate there. Four pillows, a soft quilt and a fairly large double-glazed window to welcome Portugal’s wonderful natural light made me oversleep pretty much every single day.   \n\nThere are five of rooms at O Quarto Direito! Three doubles on the first floor, as well as two nice and clean bathrooms.  On the upper floor one can find a single’s bedroom and the suite with a private bathroom – both sharing the balcony. \n\nThere’s the American style living and dining rooms. Facing east, one pleasant and very \nprivate marquise with large balcony, whereas to the west another balcony. You will also find a well equipped kitchen with every \npossible item one needs to prepare the yummiest meal. \n\nAnd now what really makes this a special place: as one comes in, the front door opens into a lobby gone pop-up store, a winterish garden of curiosities and artifacts. The decoration is one for comfort and good taste – call it a guesthome rather than a guesthouse. There are books, records and a coffee machine - what else does one need, really?\n\nFinally, everybody knows that the secret for most businesses is, “location, location, location!”, right? Well, O Quarto Direito can be found at the very heart of Oporto, near the cultural colossus that is Casa da Música. So what else can one ask for? Yeah right, hats off to these guys!\n\n"},{"_id":"169434062","date":{"$date":"2017-07-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19396377","reviewer_id":"137299401","reviewer_name":"Mari","comments":"Teresa e Ines han sido muy amables y simpaticas,la casa era muy bonita y todo muy (Website hidden by Airbnb) un apartamento muy amplio con varias habitaciones que se alquilan a diferentes huespedes junto con las propietarias.Han sido buenas anfitrionas!!!!"},{"_id":"174620898","date":{"$date":"2017-07-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19396377","reviewer_id":"55319820","reviewer_name":"Sindy","comments":"Super logement, avec des hôtes très accueillantes.

She lives in the same building so if there is anything you need, she is right there. Rafael was quick at replying to all emails. We thought we had a problem with the air conditioner and he replied immediately with a solution. (turns out it was me not turning it on properly). He also made recommendations on what to do in the area age appropriate for our teenagers. There was even a box of chocolates welcoming us, a welcome kit with shampoos and such, hairdryer, hair straightener, as well as a book with do's and don'ts in the area. Staying at Rafael's was better than staying at a hotel, it was more like staying at home and we will definitely stay with him again next time we are in Rio. An excellent experience all around.

Accommodation is not cheap in Honolulu but Mike's place is really cost effective in terms of its location, house condition and equipments, and most of all Mike's hospitalities.

Mike sent us pictures of where to park and how to check in making it a very easy process. Mike welcomed us to use the refrigerator and kitchen, but it wasn’t very clean so we decided not to use it. I’m not sure if it was dirty because the other guests didn’t clean up after themselves, but the fridge, floor and counters needed a good wiping down. Other than that, for the price we paid, it was a good value.

Very clean, bright and much bigger than I had thought it would be. The gym and pool were a great.  I think my son would have spend more time in the pool if it was heated:) The unit does not have air conditioning throughout, but does have a standing unit for the master bedroom only. My son found the second bedroom hot at night.  I think this would only be a problem in the summer months.  When we were there the days ranged from 27-30 degrees. \n\nThe neighborhood was nice, clean and very safe.  There were many shops near by for us to get everything we needed (butcher, grocery store, wine, cafe, pizza and more). We were only a few minute walk to the metro, which was easy to get to downtown Porto and the airport. The metro cards were very easy to buy at the stops .60 euros for a card and 1.20 euros per ride.

There are a few nice spots where parking on the weekend is free, but they are hard to come by.  \n\nAnnie's place is close to most attractions, so you don't really need a car.

It was really easy to check in and she was very quick to reply. The building itself is secure and right in the middle of Surry Hills so as other's mentioned - lots of restaurants and bars. We walked most places and were able to catch the train and also the bus several times. The apartment did have most everything we needed. The only disappointing part was the noise. The building was going through renovations so they started working around 6:30a during the week and we could hear jackhammers. Also, the apartment is right across the elevator. Overall, we enjoyed our stay - just wish we could have slept in some days."},{"_id":"206995180","date":{"$date":"2017-10-27T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1944996","reviewer_id":"2089615","reviewer_name":"Dylan","comments":"Annie’s apartment was fantastically well located in a hip and central region of Sydney, walkable to most major attractions and public transit to those beyond walkability.

This apartment is in a fabulous location right in the middle of things, but was also extremely peaceful and quiet. \n\nAnnie was a really great host as well. Always prompt with communication, helpful and very flexible.

The apartment was cleam and well equipped, electric heaters were also provided in the bedrooms and living room, though the apartment especially the bathrooms remained quite cold. Unfortunately, we also noticed that the hot water was just enough for 5 people to shower, although sometimes the water became cold before the last person finished. Nearby the apartment are shops, supermarkets, shopping malls and public transport. The street facing  the bedrooms can be quite noisy at night due to traffic, so light sleepers may need earplugs.

His place was amazing. He clearly takes pride and enjoys being an Air BNB host and it shows! His place is tastefully decorated and cleverly designed. He has thought of every detail to make everyone comfortable and enjoy the stay. We came in the middle of a rare heat wave in Porto and he had good fans in every single room. He even had wine, fresh bread, sardines, etc.  waiting for us when we arrived, which was such a nice surprise after a long day of traveling.

E' presente l'ascensore. Inoltre è possibile raggiungere il centro città in circa 20 minuti (più facile all'andata che al ritorno). L'alloggio è molto pulito e ordinato e Vasco è molto gentile e cordiale. L'unico neo, l'alloggio è un po' rumoroso (tranne che nelle ore più notturne) perché è situato sopra una rotonda molto trafficata.

En ningún momento pudimos ver al propietario y nos comunicamos a través del chat. Nos dice que se va a retrasar la limpieza por lo que nos manda a las 16 al piso. Baja la chica de la limpieza y nos dice que hasta las 16:30 no la tiene acabada. Mala comunicación entre los dos. Al dueño le decimos que nos deje el apartamento 1h30 min más el último día y el propietario no nos dio ninguna solución alternativa ( no cobrar la limpieza, salir más tarde, o un dto para la próxima visita).

What we liked in particular was that the bed is perfectly located to face the windows, which in turn faced the scenic riverside.The apartment is also only a fifteen minute walk from the centre, which made it really convenient to reach all the exciting parts of Porto quickly (and also for us to occasionally walk back for a quick rest). There’s a nice and well-equipped kitchenette with a sizeable mini-fridge. The apartment has good air-conditioning and heating.\n\nMiguel was very responsive during our stay. He offered a few activity/event suggestions during our stay, which was thoughtful and definitely appreciated. Also, on our second night, he fixed a noise complaint we had almost instantly (the neighbours in 2A, Miguel’s other Airbnb, were partying late at night and the wall separating the two apartments are thin).\n\nAnother thing of note is that we never met Miguel. Upon booking the apartment, we did not know that we would only engage with his neighbour Paulo. We only found this out after inquiring about the check-in procedure one week before the trip.\n\nThe check-in procedure was a somewhat uncomfortable experience. We were let in by  Paulo, who definitely meant well, but ended up staying in the apartment and talking to us for just a bit too long (about forty minutes). He gave us helpful tips, which we appreciated, but there were frequent episodes of awkward silence as he has the habit of presenting most of his tips in the form of a quiz. He would make us guess what he was alluding to and would not move on until we had found the answer he was looking for. This in particular is what made the check-in procedure a bit uncomfortable.\n\nThe lighting over the wooden stairway that leads up to the apartment is very weak, making it very hard to see clearly. This was not a large issue until our last day, when they had just cleaned the stairs. It was still wet when we left the apartment to check out, but because it was so dark we could not see this until it was too late. There was also no sign warning us about the wet stairway. With our heavy backpacks on, we slipped and almost fell down the stairs. Luckily, we managed to grab the banister. We realise that since this stairway is not part of the apartment itself, this is not purely the host’s responsibility, but it is the only way to in and out of the apartment and we could have seriously injured ourselves. When we messaged Miguel about this he did say they are working on improving the lighting.\n\nThe paragraph proportions of this review may make it look like we did not really enjoy our stay in Miguel’s apartment, but overall it was definitely an enjoyable stay."},{"_id":"235288404","date":{"$date":"2018-02-16T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19526091","reviewer_id":"136057159","reviewer_name":"Gert","comments":"Perfekt beliggenhed gæstfrihed og service, ren og hyggelig lejlighed. \nKan varmt anbefale dette dejlige sted. \n\nVH Alice og Gert"},{"_id":"236469928","date":{"$date":"2018-02-19T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19526091","reviewer_id":"8358195","reviewer_name":"Claire","comments":"Miguel was a lovely host, taking the time to share his tips and recommendations to visit the city.

This is something we actually tried to avoid when booking the room, because we cannot bring it on the plane and our stay isnt that lone. We found it misleading \n-WiFi is not working properly, the room is underground so in general there is no reach with the cell phone. This is something they should mention or improve.\n-the room wasnt cleaned well. There were hairs on the floor from the previous people.\n-the room smelled of chlorine for two days and the bathroom was still wet from cleaning when we arrived.\n-the bathroom has a big problem with humidity. Everything you leave in there gets wet,including toilet paper. There is a towelrack, but the towels stayed wet our entire stay. We had 2 p.p. so this was a problem.\nWhen I texted Andre, two new towels were brought, but this didnt solve the problem.\nIn the end we had to put the towels on coathangers and hang them up in the bedroom or on the table and turn up the heater. This kind of worked but is  annoying and ridiculous.\n-I also asked for more kitchen towels,since there was only one for six days. We didnt get any, Unfortunately.\n\nI do not like giving bad reviews, but I wouldnt have booked the room had I known this.

It's that the host, Therese, is absolutely outstanding. She met me for check-in after 3am because of traffic. She made sure I had everything I needed. She even made authentic Pho and another Vietnamese traditional soup. She showed me the sights of the city and told me about the ones that she thought it should see without her when she had errands. I told her that I am learning French because I am going to grad school in France next year and she took the time to give me some pointers.

One does not have to remember complicated bus routes in order to get around in Montreal--the Metro is fast, efficient and inexpensive.

The parking space attached to the home made arrival and check-in easy, and the air conditioning unit in the bedroom was a godsend during the heatwave. The apartment was clean, nicely decorated (with touches like flowers and trays of glassware ready for use), and perfectly sized for the two of us. We also loved the location - a short walk to both the metro and a nearby grocery. The one issue we encountered was around checkout. When we asked near the beginning of the visit what time we should expect to check out, Therese's answer was an hour earlier than the time listed on the website - which was fine with us, and we planned accordingly. However, on the night before our departure, she sent us a message at 11:30pm asking if we would be able to leave between 8-10am and if we would be able to move the car around the same time. In the end, we left and moved the car only an hour before our planned departure time. Overall, we had a fantastic experience at this Airbnb, but the muddled information about checkout added an extra layer of complication to the end of our stay."},{"_id":"290037776","date":{"$date":"2018-07-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19550563","reviewer_id":"117833854","reviewer_name":"Denise","comments":"Therese's place is very clean \u0026 she is  very responsive with all communication.

L'endroit, à deux pas du square St-Louis et des rues St-Denis et St-Laurent, figure un quartier tranquille et charmant, où il fait bon vivre, où les enfants dépassent en nombre les autos... Les maisons ont toutes un charme certain, dans leur style urbain de début du XXe. L'appartement mis à disposition par Sarah et Aristide se trouve sous leur logement - de sorte qu'on peut résoudre immédiatement toute question avec eux - au rez-de-chaussée de leur maison. Tout y est charmant, des murs en brique au sol en parquet (et en pente!) au mobilier cosy et fonctionnel à la fois. On y loge aisément à 3 grâce au fauteuil convertible en lit dans le petit salon. Et l'appartement permet aussi d'y cuisiner et d'y manger.

The neighborhood is absolutely charming, and pretty walkable to everything we wanted to do and see (put on about 10 miles/day) but in the lovely fall weather and cute streets of the neighborhood and city we didn't mind walking at all!\n\nSarah was so friendly and quick to reply to all of our messages - offering suggestions on best places to thrift shop, and tips on finding a free parking spot for the weekend. Definitely appreciated!\n\nThe flat itself was very clean and pretty big - had everything my fiance and I needed; with a very comfortable bed I may add! The only small bump in our stay is that I believe Sarah and Aristide have a small child/children who we heard running around every morning at 7:30/8AM. We love kids, and have a few nieces and nephews ourselves, so we totally understand that they have a LOT of energy in the morning - but a heads up for people who like sleeping in late - this wasn't a huge issue for us as we are fairly early risers, but just worth noting. \n\nOverall - great first time to Montreal!

We received a note upon our arrival of what to expect when we reached the apartment, along with guidelines of where to park -Montreal street signs can be a little tricky. The apartment itself was very clean, cozy and has lots of character. The interior brick walls were a nice touch, the floors were a little uneven in certain areas - we got used to it fairly quickly and it definitely added to the rustic feel of the apartment. It is also in a great location - close to various cafes, shops, and in the middle of two main streets. The kitchen was stocked with the essentials for cooking - as well as coffee and tea which is always a plus. Internet was easy to connect to and very fast - there was also a small, yet loud, stereo system available for use in the living room.

Really lovely and peaceful, with good waves of gentle or rocking waves. This is sure to be an amazing spot to whale watch in the winter. It was so nice to wake up and lounge on patio and watch the sunset, from either the patio or the lounge chairs.\n\nKitchen is modern, with enough counter space. Lots of pots and pans. Electric stove. Has an oven, but you may not want to turn it on. Bathroom is good. Bedroom is a good size, with dresser and closet. Bed shakes quite a bit, so light sleepers should consider that. Main room is comfy. Has one of the new Roku TVs, so a good screen and easy access to Netflix, etc. \n\nThe place typically does get a good amount of breeze, but it does get stuffy if it's a hotter day (like our first two days) or if you close the front door. So expect to have the front door open a lot (there's a screen door you can use, but we closed the door at night). \n\nFor the outside, it has a nice grassy area, but the access to the ocean is down some rock steps that lead directly into the ocean, so it can be tricky, especially if you are carrying a board. Most of the time, you need to swim to get to the nearby beach. The pool is nice but on the smaller side. Parking is down the steps and easy with the pass.\n\nRhett was responsive and provided a bunch of tips before we arrived, for those of you not familiar with the area."},{"_id":"199414528","date":{"$date":"2017-10-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19576456","reviewer_id":"23101851","reviewer_name":"Fiona","comments":"This property is spot on - the views are simply stunning.

Rhett was super responsive from the time that I inquired about the condo until I booked it and we checked-in. All the instructions were very clear and made it a really easy process. The condo itself was amazing! The views are what you see on the pictures - oceanfront means oceanfront and facing west meaning amazing sunsets! The condo was super clean and quiet - except for the waves crashing on the seawall which was the best sound to fall asleep to - even though the bedroom is on the other side, you could hear the waves from the bedroom. The condo had modern amenities and everything we needed, even beach towels, snorkeling gear, beach chairs and boogie boards, which Rhett had confirmed to me prior to our arrival. It was well furnished and very nicely decorated. The pool is small but turns out we didn't even use it and just went to the beach. The location is great and we loved going to the Napili market for groceries (close and seemed less expensive than Safeway, plus thy are super nice). We also tried Maui Tacos next to the market and LOVED it (we ate there twice). We also went to the restaurant at the corner there called Beach Bums BBQ, it was ok/good. Access to West Maui beaches was perfect from the condo, but there is a lot of traffic to go to/from South Maui beaches (would take us about an hour one way in heavy traffic but it was worth it). All in all, we had a great stay and Rhett made our first condo experience seamless and very easy! I would definitely consider staying there again!"},{"_id":"250978494","date":{"$date":"2018-04-06T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19576456","reviewer_id":"86543584","reviewer_name":"Susie","comments":"Great place!

They also provided snorkelling equipment \u0026 beach towels. Would highly recommend, thank you!"},{"_id":"329826168","date":{"$date":"2018-09-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19576456","reviewer_id":"88806714","reviewer_name":"Reena","comments":"The hosts were great communicators and very responsive. We ran into a couple of issues, which they quickly moved to address. The location is fantastic! The kitchen is big and well-equipped, and the bed is comfortable. The view from the Lanai was wonderful. The hosts are very clear that there is no air conditioning in the unit. We found it a little warm for us, but we like to sleep in cold rooms. My advice is to check the weather for the time of year you're booking, and know yourself: if the average nightly low is in the 70s, and 70s with a breeze (and excellent fans) is too warm for you, this apartment will be too warm for you. Also, note that the beach out front (which is awesome! We saw sea turtles!) is only really accessible at certain times of day, at least in our experience. During high tide, the bottom stairs that lead down to it are underwater, and the immediately accessible beach strip (i.e. not blocked by rocks) is also entirely underwater."},{"_id":"338175251","date":{"$date":"2018-10-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19576456","reviewer_id":"199223902","reviewer_name":"Chance","comments":"Great place, amazing views!!!!!"},{"_id":"339694557","date":{"$date":"2018-10-21T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19576456","reviewer_id":"14092908","reviewer_name":"Joshua","comments":"Outstanding views and beautiful sunsets from the condo.

Pictures were accurate of the space and unit was very clean. I live on-island and we stayed for an extended weekend getaway with a larger group of family- it was AWESOME! \nCommunication: Laura was very prompt in replying back to me and answering questions. She lives in the area and was able to give a showing prior to our arrival. \nLocation: If your looking to get away from town/city life/noise/traffic, then this is the place to go. About one block away from the nearest beach access. Small town area with convenience and grocery stores within 5min drive. Good place to stay if your wanting to see all the north shore attractions.\nProperty: There are two identical units in a newly renovated house. There's AC in all the bedrooms and the living area. House has vaulted ceilings with exposed wood beams, and a skylight above the kitchen. The lanai goes around 3/4 of the home, with a GIGANTIC yard. The yard volleyball court doesn't even take up 20% of the yard. There is fruiting trees on the property, with ripe avocados during my stay. There's enough parking for about 6 vehicles. \nAmenities: The rental came with bedding, towels, wifi, tv. Kitchen is stocked with cooking necessities (utensils, pots, pans, coffee maker, rice cooker). House also has full size laundry and bbq grill outside. Just had to bring food, drinks, personal toiletries.\nOverall: I highly recommend staying at Laura's place for anyone looking to stay in a nice, large, clean place rented out by kind people. I'll definitely stay again.

The ten of us fit comfortably in the well-appointed and spotless units. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook a proper Thanksgiving dinner, with some nice extras like a blender and crock pot. I really appreciated the vaulted ceilings and windows everywhere. The rental is located in a quiet area of town and conveniently close to the North Shore, shrimp trucks, Polynesian Cultural Center, and much more. Oh, and yes, there is a washer/dryer on premises! Laura is the most gracious of hosts and we were lucky to connect with her.

There is a little stream on the mauka side where the kids were busy catching guppies.   They also had the volleyball net set up  ready to serve. Clothes washer and Dryer in back.  Also with permission from Laura, we set up tents in the back jus to give the kids a camping experience and they enjoyed it a lot...  All in all, our group was disappointed to leave because this was such an awesome experience. Laura was not to far away if we needed to contact her, only time we had to contact her was to say hello and then at the end to say farewell and that we will be back...

Staying at your house was the best thing we did. We were able to cook our own meals,wash cloth have the kids play and run outside they play with the chickens saw the fish and turtles in the creek. In a hotel we would not have been able to do all that. We were so close to the beach, stores, hiking waterfalls, restaurants and a food truck market. The house was fully loaded with things that we needed. Like dishes, pots \u0026 pans, crockpot, coffee machine, towels, soap, blankets and soooooo much more. We bought some beach toys, volley ball, tennis racquets and donated them to your house for future visitors. My sister and I would wake up every morning have our coffee on the front porch and enjoy the beautiful view. I would suggest you having some fold out chairs maybe 4 per unit so when people go to the beach they have something to sit on, also cleaning supplies, kitchen sponge and small kitchen cleaning cloths. We rented the whole house and it was perfect for us we had so much space for 11 people. I would recommend this place to family and friends. I will be back soon I hope God willing. Thank you Laura \n\nAloha"},{"_id":"257087943","date":{"$date":"2018-04-24T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19587001","reviewer_id":"1198482","reviewer_name":"Davy","comments":"Laura's home was perfect for the occasion.  e booked Laura's home alongside the estate next door for a 4-day wedding extravaganza.
