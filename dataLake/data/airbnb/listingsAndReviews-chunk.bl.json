I was looking for a place to stay in NYC to visit and see the sights and we got more than what we asked for with Kaytlin's place. We felt like we lived in NYC. \n\nFirst about the place, place was neat and clean and all essential items were available, no problems at all. The building and the apartments were unique, the shower was in the kitchen with a curtain which was really different than what we are used to. So was the restroom which was in the hallway. Don't get me wrong both were perfect and had really hot water too. So no complaints we really loved the different experience. \n\nNext the neighborhood, absolutely awesome. Full of life and a short 2 minute walk to the subways. I will recommend the artichoke pizza place for late night eats, it is a gem. The Ethiopian restaurant couple of doors down is also worth a mention. Being a vegetarian, we had no problem finding food. \n\nOverall, an excellent stay and we gladly recommend her place to others. Go live the nyc style life at Kaytlin's place."},{"_id":"59529706","date":{"$date":"2016-01-11T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2936192","reviewer_id":"2713669","reviewer_name":"Diwank Singh","comments":"The apartment is located right in the thick of Greenwich village on MacDougal Street.

Location is fabulous but the apartment does not deliver. It's one notch above camping with a hefty price tag. Didn't worry me that the shower recess was in the kitchen ( that was detailed in the listing), it was the deteriorating state of the shower recess itself which made it feel unclean and mouldy. Also bath mats and hand towels that had not been replaced after previous guest/s, kitchen lino which had not seen a broom or mop in sometime and it was certainly not a 'Bright\" space, but it was quiet. \nThe gas smell in the 'private toilet' in the hallway is unbearable (and am unsure why no-one has mentioned it before in reviews as its pervasive in that space) so if you have already booked ask to use the toilet next to it. It has no key and no gas smell. Clearly all the other residents use it so I am not sure why Airbnb guests can't? Why do we have to put up with the smelly (and who knows, maybe dangerous) toilet space? Loved New York. Loved Greenwich Village. What a shame I can't say I loved this space."},{"_id":"165700356","date":{"$date":"2017-07-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2936192","reviewer_id":"128075181","reviewer_name":"Nicola","comments":"The apartment is exactly as described, in a great location, with a lovely hostess.

It is a unique space, that made us feel like we had the 'what it's like to actually live in the Village' experience, and it was bright, and clean. The private toilet was down the hall and was accessed by key, but that added to the uniqueness of the experience, and was ideal.  It was an easy walk to the subway as well as Washington Square Park.  And it was just upstairs from Insomnia cookies, and the historic and quaint Cafe Reggio.  We would stay there in a heartbeat again.

When I was 19 I went overseas for the first time for four months and the experience provided me with the courage to follow my dreams - two degrees later and 20 years of working experience I set off on a gap year. This experience helped me find the courage to start my own unpaid project.  In that year I stayed mostly in air bnb and it allowed me to experience the culture of the place first hand. Now I'm opening up my own studio.

It is very convenient, directly above a shopping mall that has a supermarket, an ATM/bank, numerous small juice stands and pastry shops, and a drug store.  It is located within a 1 minute walk to the Siquiera Campos metro station and about 10 minutes to the beach.  The apartment feels very safe because there is a police station right next door to the shopping center, though we would still recommend not walking and only taking taxis after around 9:00-10:00 p.m.  It was perfect for Reveillon (New Year's Eve), because we were able to grab some champagne at one of the stores downstairs, and then walk down to the Copacabana Beach.\r\n\r\nThe neighborhood is also really lovely.  There is a large playground for children within a 3 minute walk and the whole neighborhood feels very green and family friendly.  On Wednesdays, there is a fruit and vegetable market in that same park area.  We preferred staying back a little, away from the main busy stretch on Avenida Atlantica.  \r\n\r\nThe apartment itself is large and very comfortable.  The main room has a side view of Christ the Redeemer, two comfortable couches, and a dining area.  The kitchen is small but perfect for making small meals, like breakfasts and lunch, and there is also a washing machine and drying rack that works great.  The bathroom has a deep bathtub which is a very unusual find in Brazil.  The bedroom was large enough for the bed plus we were able to keep our daughter's crib in the other side of the room.  The air conditioning works great in both of the rooms and the bedroom stays very dark because there are metal retractable shades.  The Internet was fast and reliable and we were even able to stream videos, which was a surprise since Internet can often be slow in South America.\r\n\r\nIt does get noisy at night, but we have a white noise machine that we use for our daughter whenever she is sleeping and that blocked out all of the exterior noise.  Also, our one recommendation for Guilherme and Tessa is to put window shades/curtains in front of the living room's windows because it gets very hot in the middle of the day in that room and the exterior lights would make it difficult to sleep at night in the living room.  Until they put in shades/curtains, I don't think the living room would be that comfortable to sleep in.\r\n\r\nBut, that's a minor point.  We would have loved to stay here much longer, especially since it is such a great value!  My brother and sister-in-law were staying at the Marriott for $375/night and their whole room was about 1/3 of the size of this fantastic apartment.  I particularly recommend this apartment for families but, no matter what your situation is, you won't regret booking here.  It's a great spot!

The two bathrooms were super - wonderful showers and always plenty of hot water. Great to have the balconies and views.\r\nThe location of the apartment is really good.

The location was spectacular, close to many amenities and walkable to the city center.  There was a lot of good recommendations given by our host and he marked up our map loaded with things to do.  While the location was great, we needed to switch places because the top level apartment was full of sewer odors coming from all the plumbing fixtures.  It was difficult to spend time in the apartment.  We called the “Feel Porto” agency and disclosed our situation.  They thought they could hide the smell with candles, but they soon realized this was a much larger building problem.  They ended up switching our apartment to the 1st floor apartment in the same building which was wonderful and did not have any odors.  The place was spacious, strong wifi, cable tv, and great heater.  The beds were comfortable and clean.  \n\nMy recommendation would be to reserve the 1st floor apartment only until they correct the plumbing issues on the 5th floor.  Nothing extremely negative about “Feel Porto” agency, they were professional and responsive.  However, I don’t think they should have rented the 5th floor apartment to begin with and we needed to interrupt our day to switch places.  They certainly were apologetic and acknowledged they would make required repairs."},{"_id":"213251151","date":{"$date":"2017-11-20T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2961935","reviewer_id":"76904576","reviewer_name":"Thomas","comments":"excellent and easy communication"},{"_id":"276301862","date":{"$date":"2018-06-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2961935","reviewer_id":"6296420","reviewer_name":"Kevin","comments":"My family and I visited Porto in June 2018, and the FeelPorto apartment was the perfect place of our exploration of that lovely city!

Dani also had everything you would need for little kids - high chair, crib, a couple toys, even a potty :) No bathtub, however, just a shower (but he did have an infant bathtub available).\n\nThe apartment is on the \"first floor\" but it's really more like the second or third. There's an elevator but you have to go up a few stairs to get to it which was sometimes an inconvenience with our stroller and three kids, but we managed fine.\n\nSo easy to get to Metro and also the hop-on-hop-off buss stops. There are a couple parks on either side of the Sagrada Familia great for younger kids. The walk to/from the Sagrada Familia is full of restaurants and cafes with outdoor seating, shops, markets, etc. I was able to walk a couple blocks to a full service grocery store as well. We felt totally comfortable walking back to the apartment at night as well. \n\nDani was readily available before our arrival, always responding promptly to my emails.

Maybe in the spartan bathroom a better shower courtain could help :-)"},{"_id":"9704127","date":{"$date":"2014-01-06T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"297908","reviewer_id":"6847735","reviewer_name":"Rachael","comments":"Our stay was wonderful!

Communication, prior to and during our stay was excellent.  Nothing was too much trouble for them and they made sure that our stay was as comfortable as possible.  They are also very passionate about the local community and it's fantastic culture.  They provide us with lots of useful information and recommendations about places to visit based on our discussions with them (we managed to communicate easily despite our limited Portuguese). \r\n\r\nThe apartment has been decorated and furnished in an imaginative way, making very good use of the space available and is very comfortable and light.  We felt very much at home immediately.  The hosts also added little touches which made us feel very welcome, including some provisions e.g. fresh fruit and drinks.  There is also a large external terrace area where you can sit and relax, with great views of Santa Teresa and the surrounding area.\r\n\r\nThe accommodation is located on a quiet street within 5 minutes walk of both the centre of Santa Teresa and Lapa, which both have plentiful bars, restaurants, galleries and other cultural sights that can be explored.  Public transport, both bus and metro, is easily accessible in Lapa, as too are taxis.  \r\n\r\nWe felt very safe within the area and would recommend the studio as a great base for exploring Rio.  \r\n\r\nIf we return to Rio, we would definitely stay at the studio and we will stay in contact with Eduardo \u0026 Raimundo, who are exceptionally generous hosts, who we now regard as friends. \r\n\r\n"},{"_id":"14809285","date":{"$date":"2014-06-27T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"297908","reviewer_id":"7943052","reviewer_name":"Harryy","comments":"Eduardo and Raimundo provided us with the best hospitality we had in the whole 2 weeks of being in Brasil for the world cup! \nThe beds were comfortable and Lapa provided plenty of options for good food and Entertainment.

Thankfully I brought these items with me. In Japanese capsule hotels these are complimentary so perhaps these could be provided for those who haven’t got these items. \n\nFYI There is no ‘daily housekeeping’ so towels / sheets are not replaced during your stay.
