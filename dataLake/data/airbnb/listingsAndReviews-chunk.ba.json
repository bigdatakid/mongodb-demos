However, because one host had given me a lower price than she should have on a month long stay, there was no attempt to provide the basic things I wanted as a guest like salt, pepper, sugar, coffee, tea, toaster, kettle, cutlery trays, hand soap, shower curtain, bath mat, facecloths, space for my folded clothes (it was all taken up by linens while the top shelves in cupboards, which I am too short to reach, were all empty) and most importantly, NOT ONE HANGER in the entire place. In fact, the other host said  that because the first host had misquoted the price, he would accept the mistake but that the place came as is. I spent over $150 on things that had already been provided in the many other Airbnb lodgings I've been in. Did I take it all with me when I left? You bet I did, it's my hard earned money. \n\nIn addition, the first host told me that they would give me a good review even if the place looked like I'd had a \"hangover party\" when I left, in return expected a 5 review or they'd be kicked off Airbnb. Funny, I paid a cleaning fee and left the apartment pretty darn clean as I had washed all the towels and swept the floors (no vacuum) the day before I left. Yes, I asked to extend for another month rather than have to find another one and move but I was willing to pay the higher price rather than go through another move. They had other bookings , two that I saw in the month but I found a much better place for less so I lucked out big time! All in all, the three places at that location run by these two hosts are nicely decorated, good location but after dealing with these hosts, I won't rent from them again."},{"_id":"260647773","date":{"$date":"2018-05-04T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"23249192","reviewer_id":"57772285","reviewer_name":"David","comments":"Un des plus beau airbnb j’ai visité jusqu’à maintenant, neuf et bien décoré.

There wasn't enough toilet paper there so we had to buy our own. There wasn't dish towels or paper towels which should be considered part of kitchen amenities. There is a few kitchen supplies but don't expect to cook a full meal there.

Where do I begin!? This was without a doubt the most amazing Airbnb experience I have ever had. Richard responded to my initial inquiry within minutes and answered every question I had right away. I proceeded with the booking. The key was waiting for me on arrival (early) and I opened the door to one of the most beautiful homes I have ever stepped foot in. Panoramic views of curl curl beach from the front of the house and an incredibly beautiful pool with waterfalls in the backyard. Gorgeous hardwood floors, brand new appliances, incredibly comfortable beds, washer and dryer, flat screen TV and a beautiful grass area to do some morning exercises after a fun surf. Clean linens and blankets awaited and a very comfortable living room couch for late night movies. That’s just where it begins. Richard went way above and beyond to make me feel welcome in to his home and ensure that I was having a great stay. We were fortunate enough to have a fun swell fill in overnight and Rich didn’t hesitate to let me use one of his brand new boards so I could go out the next morning. The weather got incredibly hot on Sunday and rich again went out of his way to bring me his own fan/cooler and even cooked me a gourmet burger! As if he wasn’t already kind enough, he continued to go out of his way with kindness and great vibes the whole stay. I have to say, I am forever grateful for this experience! I don’t write many reviews, but something has to be said about the kindness and professionalism. I felt like I was in my own home! The house is a 2 minute walk from the beautiful North Curl Curl white sand beach. If you are lucky enough to find this Airbnb available, do NOT hesitate to book immediately. You will be very thankful you did. 10 stars on every single category. I will be booking this place again as soon as I am back in the area. Richard, THANK YOU so much for making my stay as memorable as you did. You guys are some of the coolest, kindest and most genuine people out there. See you soon!\n\n\nCheers!\n-Matt"},{"_id":"248584191","date":{"$date":"2018-03-31T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"23312848","reviewer_id":"95606714","reviewer_name":"Brendon","comments":"Great spot in amazing house !"},{"_id":"276806925","date":{"$date":"2018-06-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"23312848","reviewer_id":"10384897","reviewer_name":"Alex","comments":"Great location in North Curl Curl.

There was only one, proper bed, not two queen size as stated.\n\nWhat would've made our stay more positive, apart from adequate bedding, would be the inclusion of a few, simple additions, such as:\n* a full dinner and cutlery set.\n* an assortment and approriate number of glasses, including wine glasses.\n*  the supply of basic condiments, eg salt, pepper, sugar, oil, milk (for upon arrival), an assortment of tea bags, glad wrap, foil etc.\n* a few serving platters and utensils.\n* a supply of toilet paper.\n* a secured premises.

You can book a time slot in advance, Monday to Friday only up to 9.30 pm. Otherwise a frequent bus service just down the road number136.

The Airbnb agent contacted us and helped find for us a place, but since it was already 7 pm, we didn't have much choice so he found us this place that was posted to be good for 8 people. I didn't know it was only a 2 bedroom house so I said ok we will take it. Contacted the host and she said the house was not ready, but for us she would try to clean it up fast, which we really appreciate it. When we came they were waiting for us while finishing drying the towels for us. The House is located in a beautiful dead end with jungle trees around it, but at night its all dark, not a single light on a street. The House has 2 bedrooms and a very small living room, when the sofa bed is folded out there is almost no room to pass. Would not recommend sleeping on the sofa, its old, uncomfortable and stinky. For this  reason I would only recommend groups up to 6 people to get this place, the dining table would maximum accommodate only for 6 people also. So this place would be great for up to 6 people, but for 8 people it was a nightmare... There were some bugs coming trough the door net, so do not keep the door open, the net doesn't shut tightly leaving  gaps for bugs. We accidently broke the glass from the top of a small coffee table, we were honest about it and told them about it and included 40$ that we left for the replacement of the glass which seems reasonable. Later I was contacted and said the replacement would cost around 120$,  they were very rude about it, called me names, and when I offered them to pay them their asking amount they were just continue being negative and ignored me. Would I go again to this place? not really after my experience with it, especially there are better choices around."},{"_id":"304086470","date":{"$date":"2018-08-08T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"23313997","reviewer_id":"179062305","reviewer_name":"Angelyn","comments":"Nice private area.

We used the house as our home base for exploring the Hilo side of the island.  A rental car is a must, and the covered parking was an extra bonus, because it rains often on this side of the island.

This apartment is a real home away from home in the CBD area of Sydney and within easy reach of everything. \n\nThe apartment has one bedroom, bathroom and a spacious kitchen/lounge/dining room. The kitchen has everything you could need including a dishwasher, a washing machine and a tumble dryer. We did use the oven once and it was a bit noisy but cooked really quickly. \n\nThe bathroom is a good size but it’s a bit tricky to get the shower just the right temperature. Having said that it’s a good size and once you get it going it is great. \n\nThe bed is comfy with plenty of storage in large sliding door wardrobes. \n\nThe air con works really well and cools you off just when you need it. We turned it off at night as it was cool enough to sleep and it is a little noisy when it is running. There are plenty of little reminders to make sure you turn everything off before you go out which we found really helpful. \n\nUp on floor 14 (difficult to find if you don’t know where it is as it’s not written down anywhere) there is a pool and jacuzzi with seating and a BBQ. You will need your key fob to get up in the lift and to get through the pool door. There are ladies and gents changing rooms but we didn’t explore them. When we were there the pool looked dirty and unusable (we have informed the owners) but the jacuzzi was perfect after a long day in the city. \n\nThe location of the apartment is 11/10 perfect. Come out of the front door and turn right. Go down the stairs by the Japanese restaurant and follow the alley to Pitt Street. This will lead you wherever you wish to go. It is an easy walk down to the Rocks District (15 mins) full of history. The Quays (15 mins) with all the ferry trips you could want and on to the Opera House (20 minutes) all times approx from the apartment at a slow/medium pace. \n\nThere is a brill supermarket literally 3 minutes from the apartment. Turn left out of the apartment up to the main road, turn right and walk along to Martin Place and directly in front of you there are some stairs down ward passed a burger stall. Go down these and to the left you will find an escalator down to a great shop. Took us ages to find it so hope this helps!\n\nWe used the Hop On Hop Off Bus and it was fab!! It is only a two minute walk up to Elizabeth St to the bus stop so easily accessible. They also have some great special offers on if you want to visit lots of the other attractions. We also went on the Champagne afternoon boat tour (Quay 6) and did the tour of the opera house. We were lucky enough to see an Opera at the Opera House and loved every second. \n\nAll in all we loved the place in Sydney and will definitely be passing the info on to friends and relatives. Although maybe we should have kept it a secret so we can go back again!! Lol. Thanks Tam and Johannes who always replied quickly to questions and to the lady at the foyer desk who helped us find the pool. All in all 11/10 from us!"},{"_id":"415921814","date":{"$date":"2019-02-23T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"23357535","reviewer_id":"98975317","reviewer_name":"Markus","comments":"Sehr sauberes und bequemes Apartement im Zentrum von Sydney."}]}

Super easy to find and it included on-site parking. Abdul and Kristin sent an informative message prior to our trip which made the Check In process super simple, easy and quick. The best part was being welcomed by the cutest cat ever, named Angus Beef.  Abdul and Kristin included 4 beach cruiser bikes which were a HUGE plus! The bike trail is literally around the corner from the house. Its a 2 minute bike ride to the neighborhood beach opening and a 1 minute bike ride to Ted's Bakery. We used the bikes a couple of times and it was so nice cruising down the bike trail.  We just wish we had used the bikes more, since it was so much fun. The place is pretty big and spacious. It was nice that there were two separate bedrooms with its own bathroom. One bedroom was at the front of the apartment and the other in the back passed the kitchen. Beach chairs, Beach umbrellas, beach towels, snorkel equipment, surf boards, and boogie boards were included which were AMAZING! There was also a couple pairs of water shoes in the bin which came in handy since my boyfriend forgot his pair at home. Both bedrooms included a small fan which was necessary since the place does not include A/C, both rooms got pretty warm. Each bedroom provides you with 4 small hand towels and 2 Big Towels. Can't beat this location, only a 15 minute drive to Haleiwa town and in-between the drive you pass so many beautiful beaches and yummy food trucks.

Great location! The beach is a 5 minute walk away, but there is a reef right there so you can't swim there. If you walk 5 minutes down the beach you get to sunset beach, which is very nice. Good for swimming and has a nice wave break. No air conditioning so please be aware of how humid and hot Hawaii can get. The front bedroom got some breeze but the back bedroom was very hot and stuffy. Seemed expensive for the price... but the location cannot be beat!

The house is like in the pictures, new and clean, it is an old building but he did a fine work renovating it. \r\nI didn't walk much on this neighbourhood since I didn't have a lot of days. It was noisy for me in the living room, sometimes we couldn't open the window all the way but I guess this is Istambul, like my country Spain, noisy. The room was quiet, so good for sleeping.\r\nThere are two things that I wasn't very comfortable with,  one being the bathroom, I didn't realized in the pictures that it was so small, the shower was very good but you have to take the toilet paper out every time you shower and there is no place really to leave your toiletries, and the second one was that we couldn't really cook because there was nothing to cook with, so it was not completely equipped, just basics. Not a big problem since there are a lot of restaurants to try out!\r\nThe stairs to the flat are very narrow and a bit steep so if you have trouble climbing stairs keep this in mind, other than that, you get use to it easily, Volkan helped us with our heavy luggage.\r\nI must say that we are on our 40's and that is why I think this is a flat more for young people than for a mature couple.

Very accommodating, genial, very easy to communicate with (both upon the time of the booking and during the duration of our stay), clearly loves the Istanbul culture and can give good suggestions on how to go about the trip.  \n\nThe flat was as advertised. Clean, amenities all working, wifi was good, sheets, towels and extras were provided. Volkan was also nice enough to take care of our laundry.  I travelled with my family (dad and sister) and found the flat to be very comfortable to fit us all. Bathroom may be a bit small but it's easy to get over that with the space we got anyway. \n\nThe neighborhood is a bit raw and hilly (steep in some parts - so get a good cab if traveling with heavy luggages) but very very near the Istiklal Caddesi which is basically one of the major veins of Istanbul. So that's a plus. Very near the flat also are small restaurants serving good and inexpensive local food and minimarts for basic needs. \n\nIstanbul is a great city with nice people and amazing food.

Но если в Вас весу не 120 кг, как во мне, довольно крутая винтовая лестница не сильно испугает. Интерьер очень приятный, полностью соответствует фотографиям. Особенно понравился деревянный пол, неокрашенный, просто лакированный или пропитанный маслом - приятно ходить босиком. Так как мы были в гостях у Волкана 16 дней, очень выручила стиральная машина (правда все надписи на ней на турецком, но при наличии Wi-Fi - это не составило никаких проблем).  Звукоизоляция отличная.Двери входные надежные, стальные. С балкона можно наблюдать обычную жизнь местных. По воскресеньям овощной рынок с утра и до восьми вечера. Автобусная остановка в 5 минутах ходьбы. До Таксима - макс. 10 минут.

Я не успевал, а оказавшись на такой лестнице без света то ещё удовольствие. Сама квартира не большая, но мне самый раз, я жил один.

Как мы поняли, абсолютно аналогичные квартиры находятся этажами ниже и выше, с небольшой разницей. Только наша квартира была с небольшим открытым балкончиком. \n\nПрекрасное местоположение, до центральной улицы рукой подать. В воскресенье из окон туалета открывается прекрасный вид на рынок и жизнь турков :))) \n\nКвартирка показалась нам уже немного потрепанной, было бы замечательно чуть обновить ремонт(покрасить стены, починить смеситель на кухне) и получше убираться (часто натыкались на чужие волосы, пододеяльник был старый и в катышках). \nНо брат Волкана - Атилла извинился за не очень хорошую уборку, сказал, что обычно они сами тщательно чистят квартиру, но в этот раз не смогли, и убирался кто-то другой. И, пожалуй, за такую цену можно простить эти небольшие недостатки. \n\nВстретил нас Атилла, все объяснил, показал и был всегда на связи. По всем просьбам быстро откликался. За что ему большое спасибо!"}]}

It's really conveniently located to Haleiwa, which we loved, and we enjoyed the close restaurants and beaches. There's a small kitchen area with a full size fridge, pans, and dishes, in case you want to cook in house. You can eat inside at the dining table, or outside on the picnic table on the patio that's fenced in for privacy. The queen-size bed is super comfortable - it definitely was better than \"shack\" might make you think! The outdoor bathroom and shower were charming. There are windows and screens all around the top part of the building, so we could hear the ocean and see the stars at night, without having bugs flying in all over the place.

Grocery store within a bicycle distance away. We would definitely stay here again if we come back to the Norh Shore. Plus, there’s actually a car rental place in town. Look them up.

The shack was only a 5-10 minute walk from the beach and only 25 minute drive to our absolute favorite north shore town on the island, Haleiwa. We were also a super close drive to all the big wave beaches hosting the Vans Triple Crown.  You could hear the waves crashing at night and it was absolutely magical.  My favorite part of the shack was the simplicity of it and all the bright colors decorating the space.  They even had a tiny tabletop Christmas tree that really made it that much better.

There was no noise from the neighbouring apartments and we heard no aircraft noise from our arrival (around 7pm) to our departure the next day (8.30am). We stayed on a Saturday night.\n\nFelix was very prompt in his communication before and during our stay which was appreciated. He sent a text message to check that we were able to check in okay. Felix has detailed instructions including photos on how to find his apartment. I followed them step by step and it was not too difficult to find. When I reported that there were only 2 towels (we were a group of 4) he came over immediately after work to deliver more towels, hanging the bag on the outside door handle so as not to disturb our stay.\n\nI was amused that the bottom 2 thirds of the second bedroom window actually looks INTO someone's garage. \n\nThe kitchen would benefit from more cutlery - there were no teaspoons to make tea/coffee nor enough cutlery for everyone (4 of us) to eat at the same time.\n\nI couldn't find street parking but since I have a smallish car (Astra sedan) I was able to use his garage which is not suitable for medium or large cars (FYI) as it is much narrower than a normal garage. My suggestion is to reverse in as one wall is pretty much just a thin layer of flexible tin and you can squeeze out of your car that way. \n\n"},{"_id":"292776623","date":{"$date":"2018-07-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"23428550","reviewer_id":"105404389","reviewer_name":"Mohan","comments":"Felix is very quick to respond to questions!\n\nUnit is close to local shops, walkable distance!\nVery close to public transport!\n\nLoved the mini courtyard in the front!"},{"_id":"293200332","date":{"$date":"2018-07-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"23428550","reviewer_id":"43667292","reviewer_name":"华","comments":"Felix's apartment is convenient for (Website hidden by Airbnb) clean and sanitary.Very good."},{"_id":"300311519","date":{"$date":"2018-08-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"23428550","reviewer_id":"148002705","reviewer_name":"(Email hidden by Airbnb)","comments":"Convient acomodation"},{"_id":"301803054","date":{"$date":"2018-08-04T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"23428550","reviewer_id":"40387743","reviewer_name":"Sachin","comments":"Nice Stay"},{"_id":"302638322","date":{"$date":"2018-08-06T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"23428550","reviewer_id":"86332607","reviewer_name":"Sarah","comments":"It was a perfect appartment in Sydney !"},{"_id":"304573082","date":{"$date":"2018-08-10T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"23428550","reviewer_id":"201739865","reviewer_name":"Iain","comments":"Was great Felix very quick with responding and place was all freshly renovated.."},{"_id":"305819214","date":{"$date":"2018-08-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"23428550","reviewer_id":"50027366","reviewer_name":"Hyeyoung","comments":"Gooood"},{"_id":"307674816","date":{"$date":"2018-08-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"23428550","reviewer_id":"149523675","reviewer_name":"Henry","comments":"Very good, feel convenient and comfortable "},{"_id":"308657905","date":{"$date":"2018-08-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"23428550","reviewer_id":"207913643","reviewer_name":"Ray","comments":"."},{"_id":"315447115","date":{"$date":"2018-08-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"23428550","reviewer_id":"24051545","reviewer_name":"Steve","comments":"So close to shopping centre / cheap eats and bus route.

I write this not to focus on the initial lack of clean sheets but Carolina’s kindness and responsiveness to resolve the issue. We loved the apartment, the bed is very comfortable, it has a great view of the little square next door, and it was well heated during our cold and rainy stay. Carolina is an incredible host, we would love to come back again someday!"},{"_id":"251144324","date":{"$date":"2018-04-07T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"23435015","reviewer_id":"3240263","reviewer_name":"Daniela","comments":"El mejor alojamiento de nuestro viaje a Portugal! El piso es bello, la decoración es impecable, la comodidad es inmejorable. La cama era súper cómoda, nos dieron una cuna para el bebé y una silla. También podíamos regular la calefacción del piso, lo que era un plus pues en otros alojamientos de la ciudad estaba fija y con la lluvia hacía bastante frío. La ubicación es fabulosa, frente a un precioso parque, a dos cuadras de la librería Lello y de muchas otras atracciones. Disfrutamos muchísimo nuestra estadía en el piso de Carolina. En particular, ella y Luìs fueron  unos anfitriones inmejorables.  Pendientes de cada detalle, amables y nos dieron recomendaciones sobre dónde ir. Es por personas así que la experiencia de Airbnb es única. Nuestra próxima vez en Porto, será en su departamento sin duda.

Istanbul is a city teeming with life and Taksim is at the centre of it all. If you haven't experienced Istanbul before, this is where you need to be. There are convenient transport links to all the touristic sites. This place is very close to the square, but a short downhill walk away from it, which tends to keep the immediate area quieter. Even so, there is a very useful convenience store and food outlet right next door. I slept well in this place but, like all of Taksim, you will fare better if you fit in with the rhythms of this lively city (which I did as a night owl). I would recommend it to almost everyone. By aware that you need to climb a few (~50) stairs. I read the other reviews and generally agree with them, although I personally experienced no internet problems. I never met Ismail, but he kept in regular contact to see that I was managing ok. I left very satisfied.

(La hija del anfitrion ya nos dijo donde tendríamos que encender de nuevo si esto pasaba, cosa que en principio era ocasional) pero nada más lejos de la realidad. La Luz saltaba continuamente. A las dos horas llego el anfitrión a \"solucionar\" el problema trayendo un radiador más y con un técnico de electricidad para dar más potencia y subsanar el problema que ellos ya sabían que tenía la casa. Incluso nos llegaron a sugerir que utilizásemos la chimenea, cosa que no se especifica en el anuncio, para lo que habían dejado 4 palos para 5 (Website hidden by Airbnb) casa no está acondicionada para el invierno y la tarea de ducharse 5 personas con un calentador eléctrico si salta La Luz cada 5 minutos es imposible. Cancelamos la reserva y le solicitamos un reembolso al anfitrión en persona, y se marchó dejándonos con la palabra en la boca. Lo hicimos formalmente a través de la plataforma airbnb y se negó también. Nada recomendable.

There is a noisy crossroad next to the mansion. You won’t be able to sleep with the window open. But even with a closed window it is quite noisy in the bedrooms. The house itself is quiet. The apartment has a kitchen with everything you need. There is a TV with one english language channel. The location is very good - there are many restaurants and cafes nearby. I definitely recommend the restaurant La Piola. At the basement floor there is a good Wellcome supermarket and many shops and coffee shops around. I want to say many thanks to the host - she quickly answered all questions, and the chek-in went quickly and smoothly.

Xiaowen is great at communication and is fast with responses to any messages or inquiries. I loved that I had my own entrance and bathroom as well as a lot of closet space and great, modern aesthetics. My only things to specify are that guests should bring their own bath towels, and when I first booked this space it was listed as a private unit but it is actually on the side of the house and connected to the main house within the room by a locked door — I could easily hear noise from the kitchen during the morning and day, and the family also occasionally will play a piano that is located very close to the door.

LOW VALUE with such kind of room with NO access to kitchen, washer, dryer, hair dryer. In short, only access to a bed and a bathroom. Besides, the hosts were unfriendly. I arrived at about 22:30 and I knew it was late. So I was very polite but the tone of the host made me felt uncomfortable and she even hanged me up while I didn't finish talking. While the host saw my parents, she promptly return back to the house without even greeting to my parents. It was the most UNWISE choice I ever made to book 3 nights for them.

The location was perfect. Montreal is a super friendly and walkable city. I was communicated with within minutes every time I messaged. The bed is comfortable and living room welcoming. The balcony was a great touch to enjoy coffee in the morning. It’s also super simple to get up to. It’s the 8th floor and there is an elevator for your bags!

We visited during a time where the weather was 90F degrees and the “air conditioning” isn’t air conditioning at all. It is a standing unit where you must keep the sliding door open 8-10 inches all day/night if you want to use it, thus defeating the purpose and letting all the hot air in. It made the loft unbearable. So much so that we had to sleep downstairs on the couch and air mattress. The bathroom was nice and it has a full kitchen and washer. Those are the nice things I can say. Check in was easy and he accommodated us early which we appreciated. David (who we were in contact with) did try to help us but there were just too many problems. The WiFi worked 20% of the time we were present - he blamed it on us using too much bandwidth - we were simply trying to connect an iPhone to the internet and to text - not stream movies or download anything. The beds were uncomfortable but the place would be a good value if the WiFi worked and if it had actual air conditioning as advertised and how the pictures lead you to believe. Because we had to keep the door open (security risk) so many bugs, spiders, etc. came in too. Also the smoke detectors are covered in aluminum foil which is a safety risk. I would not recommend this Airbnb to anyone at its present state but it could be great for the cost and for bigger groups as it sleeps 5-6 somewhat comfortably. Our stay, however, was not pleasant at all and we could not wait to leave."},{"_id":"260765943","date":{"$date":"2018-05-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"23510317","reviewer_id":"7322572","reviewer_name":"Roy","comments":"This location is really central and the apartment is clean.

This is a great place to stay short term. David and Jason are very responsive and make checking in and checking out easy. However, I would not recommend staying here long term during the summer. There is not a fully installed aircon- it is a portable fan/aircon which doesn't really cool the place too well, especially on the warmer days. Jason did purchase and install two fans for me during my stay though, which I greatly appreciated.\nAlso, the shower head does not really work and sprays out minimal water. Otherwise this is a good  place to stay at during the winter or cooler days for a weekend. The place is nicely decorated and comfortable and is in a great location."},{"_id":"409817315","date":{"$date":"2019-02-08T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"23510317","reviewer_id":"11409977","reviewer_name":"Ashley","comments":"all as described"},{"_id":"411832851","date":{"$date":"2019-02-13T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"23510317","reviewer_id":"25981883","reviewer_name":"Anne","comments":"Great place in a perfect location.

Unfortunately this excitement dwindled on a daily basis. Our initial check in was great and David was most accommodating of us needing to check in earlier than 3pm, which was great. When we arrived, the place was very warm, we saw the air con wasn't actually a proper air con unit, but a mobile one sticking out of the patio doors side window. It appeared quite old as well and did not pump much cool air  further than 2 or 3 metres, so it's understandable why it was warm. There are two fans to help, one downstairs and one in the main bedroom upstairs. I think it should be made clear in regards to this in the listing., Plus you have to empty the water container (3-5litres) every day yourself. Then we looked around the place and to be honest it's a lot more tired than it looks in the photos. There are cracks and patches on all walls and two holes in the ceiling, which leaked when it rained on the last stay. The kitchen units are also looking tired and some do not shut properly. The shower doesn't work properly, it runs more like a tap due to the shower heads holes all being worn away. I reported this on day 2 of our stay and David offered to replace it but I said we would get by. On reflection I wish I'd insisted on replacing the shower head, because I have since read other reviews and saw that someone in January reported the shower not working as well, so nothing has obviously been done to correct it and may not after my report either. There were hand prints all over the patio doors and on day 3 we had been making our bed and found an empty condom wrapper under the bed. so not great on the cleaning front either. This was also reported and David offered to have the place re cleaned, but with us only having 2 days of our stay left I saw very little point. We pay for cleaning, so you expect that side of things to be done properly. We didn't notice until we left as our suitcases had been placed under the stairs, but when we took them out to leave they were covered in dust. I hope these issues are fixed for the next guests."}]}

Near Tsim Sha Tsui mtr and has a lot of bars, small eateries and convenience stores just below. However the nearest mtr station exit does not have stairs so if you are going over with luggage, it’s better to take other exits. The streets are abit hard to navigate and the pavements are narrow and uneven for luggage. The building is run down and looks like out of maintenance for a long time, from the dust and garbage pile up. The room and door are modern, clean and secure. There’s three units that share the same main door. The wall is rather thin so we keep hearing noises, especially in the morning when they lock the door. Overall it’s a value for money and everything is decent enough. If you don’t mind the exterior being run down and not a light sleeper, it’s a good choice of accommodation!"},{"_id":"259868356","date":{"$date":"2018-05-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"23531374","reviewer_id":"48296705","reviewer_name":"Valerie","comments":"Dani's place is really a steal considering how central it is and approximately 3 minutes walk to Tsim Tsa Tsui MTR. There are really good dessert places, SASA and 24 hrs Macdonalds just right outside the building which makes it bustling and not too secluded so you know it's safe even when you come back to your apartment later in the night. The apartment is small but sufficient for 2 pax and its clean and exactly as pictured. One suggestion is to include a small table mirror for future guests as it can be rather tricky to get ready without any mirror other than the one in the toilet. Small issue but other than that, it was such a pleasant stay.

It feels great to be in, has big windows and lots of light. Parking was a breeze, kitchen was well equipped, bathroom modern and clean, and upstairs bedroom in the loft was cozy. You’re walking distance to some of Montreal’s best (St Viateur Bagels, Cafe Olympico, and tons of decent local bars). We came as a family and loved it.

I was only there for one night, and Tony arranged for someone to meet me to deliver the keys, who was hospitable. \n\nParking is in a gravel parking lot, and when parked in front of the kindergarten I felt like it was a safer spot. In the morning there are many people who use the lot, so you're not the only one. \n\nKitchen is stocked with only the essentials, which is all I needed.

The host told me there was nothing he could do about this and asked me to clean it myself.  I then tried to use the dishwasher to clean my dishes. It leaked a pool of water all over the floor. When I messaged the host for help, they brought me a mop and were angry that I used the dishwasher, stating that I was ruining someone’s boutique below their place. I cleaned the mess myself and had to do dishes in the bathtub for the rest of my weekend. The fridge also doesn’t close all the way so I had to briefly transfer things to the freezer to keep them cold and the TV was locked on someone else’s chrome cast for the entire stay.

The spacious art room is equipped with everything you need - and even more.

Olan cooked me the most colorful, amazing breakfasts! I stayed alone the first few days and it's valuable to know that I felt very safe. The studio is very bohemian artsy with enough room for two adults. My boyfriend Frank arrived midway through the week and loved the cat Tuxie, Big Al and Olan. With the way the studio is set up Frank and I felt like we had enough privacy, felt lucky we had enough snacks and water yet wanted to leave the door open to share our experiences with Olan.

Olan is mindful of any dietary restrictions you may have. There is a window with view of the city street and while I stayed there was no noise assuring a restful night.  Olan has decorated the home with furnishings, rugs and amnesties that give it a homely feel and his artwork certainly livens up the space. It is important to note that access to the room requires passing through Olan's living area space that he shares with his cat and small dog, separated by a hanging sheet. This includes when visiting the restroom and is not a problem as Olan respects your privacy and space. Just be careful not to trample his friendly pets during the night.  Pets will not enter your room so long as you keep your door closed. The listing does state that the  bathroom and kitchen are shared. In the bathroom is a variety of liquid soaps, shampoos and other products that can be used. \r\n\r\nThe room features soft and comfortable bedding with many pillows and plentiful thick towels. There's a hanging space for your clothing near the window and several touch activated lamps in the room to create the desired ambience. \r\n\r\nThe location is superb with a gourmet local market nearby and a subway entry that is less than 10 minutes to times square and Broadway.

The room is big for one person, you sleep on a mezzanine, which is really nice, you have your comfy space away from the streets.....I loved watching movies and drawing up there. The neighborhood is amazing, it's safe to walk here anytime of the night. All in all I can only recommend this place, it's funky and I felt right at home living among three sweet boys :) thanks for the great stay guys.\n\n* I get eczema from cat and dog hair so I just didn't let them in the room, it was not an issue. They are also not allowed in the bathroom. But if you don't like animals, this might not be the best place for you ~"},{"_id":"210464461","date":{"$date":"2017-11-09T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"235651","reviewer_id":"148045766","reviewer_name":"Amy","comments":"What a perfect stay! Of course the location/room/apartment are absolutely incredible (see all the other reviews!) but Olan himself is what made our stay so special. We always felt completely at home and very well looked after - when I arrived with a bad cough Olan plied me with vitamins, homemade chicken soup, and other treats (and it worked - I got better in a few days!). Could not recommend his place highly enough.

We’ll start with the loft - the space is super cute, trendy, and spotless. The location is AMAZING! So close to everything, all the trendy neighbourhoods, Greenwich, Chelsea and Soho to name a few, are walking distance away including all the fantastic places to eat around the place - too many for us to get through! The subway is at the corner and only one or two stops away from the big attractions. And now, Olan. Ah we love this guy. He made us feel so at home. So friendly and always went out of his way no matter what. Stayed up for us to welcome us when we arrived in 3 hours late, prepared us a home cooked breakfast the morning after we arrived (which was deliscious by the way), got up at 4am to see us off (who does that!?) and always had insider tips, tricks and recommendations for anything and everything if we ever needed some guidance. Honestly, we couldn’t ever thank him enough. We had the best time here. If you’re looking for a spot in NYC, this is it.

Olan is an\nartist and film-maker who has lived in the area for many years.

The location can't be beaten if you're\nworking at (Hidden by Airbnb) (it's a 30 second walk to the 8th ave entrance). There are\nmany amenities in the apartment, including a fridge and AC. The bed is really\ncomfortable, and Olan has a bunch of good pillows. The AC unit is quite good\nand managed to keep the room cool even on the hottest summer days. The room\nitself is really pretty and full of interesting art that makes it charming. Olan\nalso has two wonderful pets, Mr. Al (a Jack Russell / Corgi) and Tuxie (a cat).\nBoth are quite friendly and easy to get along with. The bathroom is also very\nclean, and there's a shower and many soaps/shampoos to use. Olan lives in the\napartment, so you're staying at an actual home that has been properly taken care\nof and has all of the amenities you would expect. This made living here feel\nmore like being Olan's roommate, which was a great part of the experience.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed my stay with Olan and strongly recommend his apartment\nto anyone staying in New York."},{"_id":"344437980","date":{"$date":"2018-11-03T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"235651","reviewer_id":"106201904","reviewer_name":"Zhen","comments":"Olan is amazing!"},{"_id":"355768195","date":{"$date":"2018-12-05T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"235651","reviewer_id":"5427900","reviewer_name":"Nam","comments":"Im not sure which was better, Olan (Mr Al and Tuxe) or the location!! \n\nThe location is just perfect-right by Chelsea market, lots of places to shop/eat, subway station on the street - perfect location!!\n\nNow Olan... an incredibly kind hearted, thoughtful host.

The location is amazing (50 mt from subway) and - if like to walk - in 15/30 minutes you can reach time square or Soho. I would choose again his place and - considering the overall experience - I would say that the price is very fair. And, last but not least, his pets give a touch of extra coziness to the place. Thank you, Olan for everything"}]}

The listings are micro-sized rooms inside an existing apartment that has been converted into a hostel like setup, except the host also lives inside the apartment. There is no expectation of privacy. Whenever you come and go, you will interact with one of the hosts. If you leave the apartment before 9am, you will need to PHYSICALLY CLIMB over a sleeping host as their bed is placed directly in the hallway, blocking entries and exits (fire hazard?). This is also true if you come back to the apartment after 1am. Additionally, the host will enter your room EVERYDAY while you are gone and re-arrange your items. There is no do-not-disturb notice that you can place on your door. The most egregious breech of privacy was one day I slept in, and both hosts knocked on my door, physically entered the room, switched on the light and visually examined the room for no reason whatsoever. The host(s) do not speak any English. I do not recommend this listing unless you are fully aware of what you are getting into.

Our feelings about the apartment are mixed.  There apartment is very compact but it has the most comfortable bed and pillows that we have had in airbnb.  We were greeted by Thomas who gave really good suggestions and  tips and took the time to write them clearly on the map. The not so good - our apartment  faced the road which is a busy bus route. It was too noisy with the balcony doors open and there are no other windows for air flow. The lock on the door is very tricky - sometimes it opens first time, other times it took 5 minutes to get it open.  It is a good 15 minute walk to the more interesting Rebeira area. It is close to the Bulhao market but this is closed for 2 years for redevelopment. Next time I'd stay in the Rebeira area but it is probably more expensive."},{"_id":"270443339","date":{"$date":"2018-05-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"23587909","reviewer_id":"17950595","reviewer_name":"Tash","comments":"Great location.

However, the apartment is rented out by a company which has 50 apartments in the city so we kind of missed the real Airbnb experience. For example, when we asked if it was possible to receive clean towels after a few days, we were told it was not included in the price. Even though that might be the case, we didn't feel it was very good service (we stayed there for 6 days), and besides this there were also no facilities to do it ourselves. The apartment looks great but to be honest it did not meet our expectations (you notice this in the quality, it's really made for short-stay rental)."},{"_id":"325008508","date":{"$date":"2018-09-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"23587909","reviewer_id":"32619706","reviewer_name":"Selina","comments":"We had a very lovely stay in Porto.

Sara organised a transfer for us from the airport as we were arriving late and also organised the late check-in. The apartment overall was great and was in a really good location, close to lots of shops but quiet enough for us to get a good nights sleep. There were a few things that weren't perfect like the door to the apartment. The lock was a bit dodgy, so it took about 5-10 minutes each time to unlock the door and eventually get into the apartment, which was quite annoying. The shower wasn't the best either and felt like it might break. Overall though we were happy with our stay and for the price it was really good value for me. We would stay here again.

Perfectly clean and really comfy beds. It's great to have the bedrooms on one floor and then the large living area below - feels like a house! Naveen left a welcome basket of fruit and veggies from the market which was a lovely touch. I have to admit I fell in love with Darlinghurst as Victoria Street outside has lots of great cafes and restaurants and it's an easy walk into the city or lots of trains and buses. There is a stunning view of the harbour bridge and opera house from the gym and pool. Having a concierge is good too, a sense of luxury and security. I had an issue with the washing machine but Naveen was very quick and easy to respond and sort everything out for me. Would happily stay here again and recommend it to others."},{"_id":"263766453","date":{"$date":"2018-05-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"23650892","reviewer_id":"68927234","reviewer_name":"Lara","comments":"Very stylish, awesome location, great host"},{"_id":"265983555","date":{"$date":"2018-05-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"23650892","reviewer_id":"1112652","reviewer_name":"JEri","comments":"Naveen’s place is absolutley amazing for style location and price.\n\nNaveen has a great eye for quirky things, the artwork and decorè is fabulous..\n\nThe gym and pool are on the same level right next to the apartment and are a real bonus.\n\nThis place is truely a rare gem..\n\nThankyou Naveen!\n"},{"_id":"266954010","date":{"$date":"2018-05-20T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"23650892","reviewer_id":"188104235","reviewer_name":"Franck","comments":"Appartement sympathique, emplacement super on retrouve tout ce dont on a besoin au pied de l'immeuble."},{"_id":"268759138","date":{"$date":"2018-05-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"23650892","reviewer_id":"57075168","reviewer_name":"Frank","comments":"Great space and fantastic location"},{"_id":"269752006","date":{"$date":"2018-05-28T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"23650892","reviewer_id":"50473604","reviewer_name":"Cara","comments":"Naveen was a great host and myself and my friends had a great stay at the loft."},{"_id":"272678738","date":{"$date":"2018-06-03T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"23650892","reviewer_id":"9253292","reviewer_name":"Catherine","comments":"Naveen’s apartment is in a great location near shops and transport and she was very available to answer any queries we had.

The host (Milo) notified me prior to my arrival of this and stated that it would be fixed by the next day. He instructed me to bathe myself with hot water. The next day he brought 2 buckets to bathe with and messaged me to state that the plumber has ordered the part and it should be arriving within the next few days and the shower should be fixed by the weekend (I had booked a 2week stay and for one week I would be without a shower). I was not ok with this arrangement and requested a different possible resolution. He then directed me to go to the roof, access the swimming pool take a shower there and then come back to the unit. I informed the host that this was not ok to which he replied \"well there is working bath and hot water so what's the issue\".  I politely requested to be relocated if he had another unit or simply a refund of my money so I could find another unit. Milo did not agree that this was a good idea and took it up on himself to threaten me that his ad never stated that he had a shower and that if I left the unit I would be cancelling my stay and there wouldn't be a refund. Long story short after many hours of attempting to politely reason with Milo I finally contacted Airbnb support and requested their assistance. They also agreed that this was not a good condition for anyone to remain in (no shower and bathing with buckets) and assisted in obtaining my full refund. The host was NOT a nice person nor was he polite or understanding or even cared about the request or the well being of the guest or the condition which he was leaving me in by asking me to bathe with buckets. He did not care about having misinformed his guest and only wanted the money from the booking. I've booked with many individuals using Airbnb however never experienced anything of this caliber. Good luck to you all who book with him"},{"_id":"248995156","date":{"$date":"2018-04-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"23671806","reviewer_id":"68491858","reviewer_name":"Chinmay","comments":"Go place to stay"},{"_id":"254638052","date":{"$date":"2018-04-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"23671806","reviewer_id":"32928203","reviewer_name":"Lauri","comments":"Book this apartment!!!!\nWe loved this beautiful home for many reasons-location-it is steps away from the basilica, great restaurants and all the old town action.
