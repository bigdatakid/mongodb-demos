We phoned and were told somebody would come in the next 20 minutes. After having waited 2 hours in the street with kids on a vrey hot day, the cleaning ladies opened the doors for us.\r\nWe then discovered the apartment hadn't been cleaned: the floor was dirty, the beds unmade, etc. (it was 7PM...)\r\nWe were asked to go out and come back later so that they could do their job.\r\nIt was only at 8.30 PM that we could go back to the apartment and finally sit down.\r\nNobody gave us any clear instruction concerning the apartment as there was nobody for the check-in (the cleaning ladies told us they didn't know what to tell us). So, this is how we later discovered where the parking was and that we had paid for parking in the street for nothing, as it was (supposed to be) included with the apartment.\r\nWhen we later  phoned the company in charge of the apartment, they never apologized to us and refused to offer us a compensation, even if we had lost half a day with their carelessness.\r\nConcerning the apartment itself, the place is cozy.\r\n\r\nSo, in a nutshell, if you are willing to risk losing half a day of your trip for an apartment, if you don't care about service at all and don't mind waiting in the street until somebody finally shows up hours later, this could be the place.\r\nHowever, if you wish to enjoy every minute of your stay and hope to be treated with respect, I'd clearly advise you to go somewhere else (even if the pictures are appealing)..."},{"_id":"93522883","date":{"$date":"2016-08-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13875927","reviewer_id":"75921928","reviewer_name":"Blandine Et Pascal","comments":"Logement bien placé , accès centre ville rapide .

Greg was very helpful with ideas for fun local restaurants and shops. We also rented a Jeep from him that we picked up at the airport. Highly recommend a 4wheel drive for the trip up the mountain to the main house as well as some fun, secluded beaches. We love the Big Island of Hawaii and staying at Greg's wonderful mountain getaway only made the experience that much better! Thank you for sharing your slice of Paradise with us!

What an amazing choice that was! Once you get on top of the hill the view of the front lanai down to the ocean is absolutely incredible! Every morning we enjoyed coffee and avocado toast on our own private lanai with breathtaking views of the coffee fields up the mountain! We picked avos from one of the many trees on the property and were surrounded by other exotic fruit like cherimoya, sapote, pomelo, papaya, passion fruit, bananas and cacao! Greg's place is very peaceful and relaxing and he is the most easy-going and accommodating host. We were glad we rented a jeep from him as well and were able to visit South Point and drive to the top of Mauna Kea. The location was very convenient - only minutes away from an awesome family-owned grocery store and The Green Market on Sundays voted in the top 50 best farmers' markets in the USA. What we enjoyed the most were the peaceful cool mornings and evenings - quite the welcomed contrast with the heat in downtown Kona. I loved doing yoga in the morning by the koi fish pond on the front lanai, marveling the expansive view of the ocean down below. The room has its own separate entrance and so does the kitchen, which was very convenient. We even got to cook some yummy vegan meals with fresh herbs from Greg's garden! It felt like being on a retreat - cannot wait to come back again and stay longer!

He answered our questions promptly and accurately, helping us to make our decision to stay. Throughout our entire visit, Greg and Pam were not only accommodating and knowledgable about the island and local area, but helpful beyond expectation! Everything from finding an emergency eye doctor and dentist, to finding secluded beaches with turtles or swimming with the dolphins...they were our best resource.  I think they have found the perfect balance of giving you privacy and being there to make your Hawaiian experience complete! \r\nAs depicted in the photo, the room was clean and comfortable and suited our needs perfectly. It was not only tastefully decorated but carried a positive energy for a very restful stay. The bed was big and comfortable and our favorite part was having coffee and breakfast on our own private balcony each morning, with an amazing view! Even though part of the main house, the room has its own private entrance, therefore it felt like a separate apartment... Which was what we were looking for...perfect. The owners have two very sweet dogs, Captain and Stella, who will greet you in the morning, but are very respectful. \r\nThe property itself has breathtaking views of the mountain and the sea. With that said, you will definitely need a car with higher clearance to get up the mountain. (Ask Greg about his Jeep for rent). There is NO  need for air conditioning  as the location/elevation is much cooler. A wonderful breeze in the evenings and a ceiling fan for the day if necessary. \r\nFrom tropical fruit trees, coffee beans, beautiful sunsets....this is an oasis  from everyday life. You will enjoy every minute of your time here. It was difficult to leave! \r\nThank you for your wonderful hospitality, we came as guests, we left as friends! \r\nMahalo!\r\n"},{"_id":"111324009","date":{"$date":"2016-10-30T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13883147","reviewer_id":"10235580","reviewer_name":"Beth","comments":"It's not just \"Hawaii\" that might put you under a spell when staying at Greg's place. The adventure of getting up the hill, the jungle like surroundings, the ocean view, the \"beach house,\" is only surpassed by Greg's generosity and true hospitality. Before I even arrived, Greg worked with me on driving directions and my car rental. He met me at the bottom of the hill and if my van could not make it (it did), he planned to use his truck to get me up there. Everything I could need was available to me. His \"work-traders\" were so kind and helpful. Even though Greg was pulled away during my stay, I was very well taken care of. If you are visiting the west side of Hawaii and enjoy a more original island feel, I strongly suggest you stay south of Kona area in Captain Cook. If you enjoy staying in a nicely appointed large room on a groomed and working tropical farm with friendly folk, then I strongly suggest you stay at Greg's."},{"_id":"112920782","date":{"$date":"2016-11-08T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13883147","reviewer_id":"71288810","reviewer_name":"Martina","comments":"Very nice apartment, surrounded by a peaceful coffee plantation with great views.

Greg is an excellent, considerate, chill host.  Greg and Pam thought about little details, like excellent sheets and little fridge in the room.  The room is lovely--spacious and a quiet.  I stayed for a whole week, and so I cooked in the kitchen where there were SHARP knives (never happens in an Air BNB, I've found).  I spent every afternoon I could sitting on the porch, knitting and watching the sun set.  Since it's a working farm, there were work-away folks staying on the property too, and I enjoyed their company.  Everyone is super chill, very polite and friendly, and you can be as social or not as you like.  There were plenty of fresh avocados, cherimoyas, lemons, strawberry guavas, and mamaki tea for me to eat and drink.  Greg pointed me to Da Poke Shack (holy shit!), The Strawberry Patch (awesome), and Annie's Island Fresh Burgers (pretty good).  \n\nThe road is no joke.  I've driven on steep mountain roads on ridges in Big Sur with non 4x4s, but I'd recommend a 4x4 just because then you don't have to worry.  Definitely you want a vehicle with high clearance.  Drive slowly out of respect for neighbors, and look out for other cars and the occasional rooster and wild boar.  You definitely want to make sure that you turn right at the rock wall, so double-check with Greg that you know the way up alright.  That said, unless you are a timid or nervous driver, it will be fine.\n\nThe dogs are sweet and chill, no problems with barking.  There are roosters around, and the cock-a-doodle all day and night, but these ones were fine and never woke me up.  That's saying a lot since roosters are my arch-nemesis.\n\nDefinitely check out:\n1. Pu'uhonua o Hanaunau--check out the history, and also walk along the lava south and check out the tide pools and sacred sites.  If you want to hike, bring water (at least 2 liters) and decent shoes and continue the six or so miles along the 1871 trail over to Hookena Bay.  Check out the website big island (Website hidden by Airbnb) for more info and more great hikes.\n\n2. Borrow snorkeling gear from Greg and snorkel at Two Step (also called Honaunau Beach), within walking distance of Pu'uhonua.  If you want to try to swim with dolphins, go to Kealakekua Bay or Hookena (I had luck at Hookena).\n\n3.  Da Poke Shack.  Duuuude.\n\n4. If you're up for adventure, bring a friend and snorkeling gear and go to Honamolino Bay (big island hikes website will tell you info).\n\n5.  Sawittri, who does massage.  Greg left her card in the room.  She's super talented.\n\n6.  The South Kona Farmers Market on Sunday mornings 9-2.  The honey guy closest to the entrance has white honey and Melaleuca (or however you spell it) honey.  It's phenomenal.  \n\nSigh...I miss it already.  Have a great trip!\n\n\n\n\n"},{"_id":"121922707","date":{"$date":"2016-12-19T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13883147","reviewer_id":"68669422","reviewer_name":"Brail","comments":"Greg's two-acre coffee farm is a lush paradise tucked away into the hillside with amazing ocean views and spectacular sunsets! \n\nGreg has two very friendly dogs, Stella and Captain, who will lovingly greet you upon your arrival! The room for Airbnb is designed to allow guests to come and go as they please and to have as much privacy as they would like. We had access to the kitchen and there was always fresh kona coffee brewed and ready to drink! We enjoyed our morning coffee everyday on the private lanai overlooking the coffee farm. The property has several different fruit trees that you can pick fruit from when in season. You definitely need a high-clearance or 4-wheel/all-wheel drive vehicle to access the property. There is a grocery store about 5 minutes away, and restaurants and shops about 10 minutes away. Be sure to check out the South Kona fruit stand and grab a fresh fruit smoothie and some other local goodies! Also, be sure to check out Mamalahoa hot tubs for a twilight soak - it's only 10 minutes away!\n\nGreg is extremely knowledgable about the Big Island and helped us to plan our trip. We have been to the Big Island several times before, but with his knowledge and advice, we were able to explore some new areas, which were amazing! Greg provided us with snorkeling equipment, beach towels, a cooler, and anything else that we might have needed during our stay. \n\nNot only did Greg help us to plan some adventures, but he took us on a couple! He graciously took us fishing and whale watching on his boat on the Kohala Coast, which was amazing, but he somehow topped this adventure by taking us on a private, full moon night flight over the active volcano! This took our breath away!! \n\nWe are so grateful to Greg for making our stay the most memorable one we have had so far! Greg really is just one of the nicest, most humble, people we have ever met and we feel like we left having made another great friend! When we return, we will most definitely be staying with Greg again! \n\nSo in short, we HIGHLY RECOMMEND staying at Greg's private coffee farm for your Big Island stay!"},{"_id":"126678930","date":{"$date":"2017-01-13T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13883147","reviewer_id":"31147929","reviewer_name":"Claire","comments":"Greg's wife was very welcoming and helpful.

We picked Greg's place because we were looking for an adventure and wanted a place with real character that wasn't a resort.  We'd read great things about Greg's place and we also really like dogs.  We got exactly what we were looking for, without actually being in a tent.  We'd never been anywhere tropical before so it was fascinating wandering around the property, learning about all the plants that grow there and the process of making chocolate.  On the last night we gathered some of the many avocados and whipped up a tasty guacamole to eat with our tacos in the well stocked kitchen.  The barbecue was excellent, the room very airy, comfortable and efficient.  The kids room was smaller and not joined (a bonus for privacy) and they (a boy \u0026 girl) appreciated not having to share a bed which is often the case in many places.\n\nGreg was an excellent host, very laid back and helpful.  On the first night he guided us up the mountain drive via text.  There were a few very friendly \"work away\" people there and one of them was an excellent co-host, very nice and helpful.  The dogs, Captain and Stella are super sweet and make the place especially welcoming.\n\nWe made use of the cooler, snorkel sets, beach mats, boogie board and jeep.  There was also a ton of personal hygiene items left behind by folks who fly in.  Buying things on the island can be a bit pricey so we found having these readily available saved us some money.  The cost of the rental was very good value for a family spending Canadian dollars.  We'd definitely go back."},{"_id":"140103523","date":{"$date":"2017-03-27T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13883147","reviewer_id":"71367241","reviewer_name":"Julien","comments":"Greg is very welcoming, the communication was perfect.

We rent Greg's car (Subaru Cross treck, 4WD) because 4WD car is necessary to access to his place on the hill. So, its sight is amazing (sunset and stars) and much better than scenic places at roadside . The room is enough comfortable to stay longer. Greg allowed us to use his well-furnished kitchen (e.g., coffee marker, rice cooker, juicer and many kinds of seasonings, Kona coffee....). So, we could cook many kinds of foods easily. We borrowed snorkeling gears, beach towel and cool bag and enjoyed beautiful sea near captain cook. We asked a lot of things to Greg and Aya and they always gave us very nice suggestion for sightseeing. We really want to come back here if we have an opportunity.

It's quiet, peaceful and really has the feel of a Hawaiian paradise. The only noises you hear are the Coqui Frogs at night and birds in the morning. Sometimes the clouds rest on the coffee farm a little farther uplslope, giving the back porch view an ethereal quality. The geckos were surprisingly curious and entertaining. We had fun watching them tussle with each other and drink from rainwater on the table. We also especially enjoyed having coffee in the morning on the front porch while looking out over the ocean. It's really hard to hold onto stress in a situation like that.\n\nCaptain Cook is about a half-hour drive from Kona. We found though that we didn't need to go down everyday. The town has restaurants, grocery store, farmers markets and roadside stands. Most of our daily papayas and mangoes came from \"Cooks Bounty\" roadside stand, across the street from Choicemart. You're also not too far from \"Two-Step\" snorkling, scenic drives and coffee farms with tastings. I wish we had explored the farms a bit more. Greenwell farms is about 10 min away. Greg is also a reservoir of knowledge on things to do in the area. Just ask and you'll have more things to do than you have days to do them.\n\nThe road up is a bit challenging and our front-wheel drive Ford Escape would occasionally slip, but when we slowed down and drove with a little more aloha, it didn't seem to be a problem. Also, slowing down allowed to discover the perfectly ripe, giant avocados that fall from a tree on the way up. I don't think we bought another avocado during our stay.\n\nGreg was very helpful and responsive. (Hidden by Airbnb) maps doesn't give accurate directions, so he met us at a parking lot to show us the way up. He was also very responsive to texts and was quick to accommodate.\n\nIf you like staying in unique and tranquil places, Greg's is a good one.

The minute I arrived, I felt like a local and was welcomed warmly by everyone. The house is located in the South Kona coffee belt and is within a few minutes drive to wonderful local beaches such as Ho'okena, Manini, and the best snorkeling on the island down at Two Step. I am so glad I stayed here instead of somewhere near Kona. Even Kona was a short drive away and as I found out, there is a new bypass highway that links Captain Cook to Kona which makes the drive even faster! It was also a convenient location for a day trip to the volcano and South Point. There was a well stocked supermarket right down the street from the house which was stocked with natural and organic products - that was a plus for me as I am vegetarian and love to eat healthy. Cooks Bounty fruit stand across the street was also great for buying local fruits, honey, and coconuts. That coconut water was very refreshing after a morning spent snorkeling! A short drive away, I found a great local organic coffee shop named Kaya's with freshly baked goodies and vegan options (and lots of art by local artists). It was a lovely spot to people watch and meet nice locals. \n\nThe house was clean, colorful, and full of life. I enjoyed the avocados, arugula, tomatoes, herbs, and bananas that grow in the backyard. The dogs were very friendly as were the geckos that seemed very interested in my cup of coffee and plate of fruits each morning. The private patio was a lovely place to have breakfast overlooking Mauna Loa and the coffee fields. There is a lot of positive energy emanating from Mauna Loa and the house is right on the slopes of it. the drive to the house (which is located on a hill) is not that bad after the first time around although it does require a 4WD vehicle (and luckily I rented one from Greg at a great price).\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed my time here. If you're looking for an immersive local experience that is one of a kind, I highly recommend Greg's Airbnb!"},{"_id":"159793677","date":{"$date":"2017-06-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13883147","reviewer_id":"123129614","reviewer_name":"Mark","comments":"Great location in a secluded area.

And I’ve met many. Most don’t live up to theIr listing’s expectations. Eugene surpassed all expectations. He went above and beyond to make sure I made it to his apartment and even arranged for his co-host Edmond to help carry my luggage up to the unit. Both hosts are so kind and personable. For the first time I felt like my hosts genuinely cared about me and my contentment. It was truly refreshing to spend time with them!\n\nThe bed in room 1 was very comfy and the sheets were so soft. The room was very tidy and had a raised desk with a matching IKEA stool. In addition to the breakfast-in-bed tray, there’s a hairdryer, full length mirror, and a bit of closet space and hangers. Because I was in town for dissertation research, the setup was absolutely ideal. \n\nThe location is removed from the chaos of Midtown, but is only about 20-30 minutes away via subway (that is, when the trains aren’t delayed; NYC public transit’s fault entirely). Morningside Park is nearby—perfect for getting in a morning walk or run.\n\nIf I could live here, I would. If I could rate 10 stars, I would.

Location is very convenient. It is within 10min of walking distance to 125th st sub stations, yes both of them with train 1 and ABCD. A and D are the express trains that only stops once between the nearest station and times square.\nThere are groceries 3min walk away. Italian, Chinese, and Sushi restaurants are right at the corner of the block as well. Oh, it takes 10-30min for most food deliveries to get to your door after ordering. There are uber drivers all over Manhattan ready for delivery. Oh, if you are here for the music school auditions.. Needless to say, you are literally living next to the school. \n2. The apartment is clean and spacious. It is a newly renovated historical building. Our room is just as the pictures shown on airbnb. Shower, heater and etc. are working in great conditions so no need to worry about those.(well, considering the price, you might wonder) Oh, two bathrooms with showers come in handy. Never had to wait for anyone to use one when needed.\n3. Laundry experience is beyond my expectations. Actually unlocked a whole new world for me as I used to do my own laundry living in Vancouver. The laundried clothes are usually just thrown into my clean cloth basket except for those that have to be hanged dry. But here in New York, they can pick up/delivery at your door. And they fold your clothes for you! Neat.\nAll for a very reasonable price.\n4. Eugene's hospitality is just another bonus on top of all the above experiences. Very responsible and friendly host. \nOverall 11/10. Would definitely return if ever getting a chance to revisit NYC.\n\n再用中文简介下好咯, 本人加拿大留学毕业后在温哥华工作. 此行和老婆一起来纽约玩, 整体感觉非常好.\n房东Eugene人很好, 有什么事情都可以商量询问. 房间所处地理位置不能算曼哈顿最繁华的地段但绝对是交通生活非常便利. 具体来熟悉了地铁线路就知道了. 房间内也很干净, 设施齐全住着很舒服. 洗衣服比想象中要方便得多, 也很便宜. 另外房东也是年轻人, 在这里住的时间内, 也有很多留学生以及五湖四海的访客, 大家都很聊得来, 晚上一起小聚畅谈也非常开心. 你也可以跟Eugene约好晚上一起体验纽约的留学生夜生活~~ (当然不能保证, 看具体他的安排咯.. 我在住期间另一个室友表示很high)\n希望有机会回来纽约玩. 下次还会来这里的. 完全的满分. 有兴趣可以自己看下上半部分英文的翻译咯 更细节些 总之纽约之旅来这里你值得拥有."},{"_id":"245505472","date":{"$date":"2018-03-22T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13884778","reviewer_id":"169641698","reviewer_name":"Aviv","comments":"Euegene's place is awesome!

However, she welcomed me warmly, showed me around the apartment and gave me advice on grocery shopping (there is a good supermarket 100 meters away), sightseeing and so forth. \nThe apartment was always very clean and the atmosphere friendly. I had my personal shelves in the kitchen as well as in the fridge and was always able to use  a the kitchen. It's definitely possible to chat to Simona when she is around but if you prefer your privacy you can close your door and no-one will bother you. \nA big plus is the access to a private corner of the terrace from the room itself. It's sunny there in morning which is just perfect for having breakfast outside.\nAlso, the apartment is in walking distance to the centre (10 min) as well as the beach (30 min) or if you prefer, it's just a short metro ride away.\nOverall, I was more than happy with my choice and would recommend Simona's apartment 100%!"},{"_id":"163073114","date":{"$date":"2017-06-23T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1391996","reviewer_id":"24554098","reviewer_name":"Guy","comments":"Stayed in the single room which has direct access to the most amazing rooftop terrace.

Not recommended, however, if you wish to do inner island sight-seeing such as Haleakala or Road to Hana.) There is parking under the building.\n\nSafeway is 2 blocks away and fabulous Baby Beach is a 10 minute walk. BTW, Baby Beach is spectacular. Easily the clearest water I've ever snorkeled in. Swim between circular coral outcroppings to see tropical fish and sea turtles. At low tide, wade out hundreds of yards and the water is not even waist high.  Kaanapali Beach - miles of sand, waves and tiki bars is just a half hour walk north or 12 minute bus ride. Easy to get to Black Rock for more superior snorkeling.\n\nComfortable Murphy bed in the living room lets you sleep to gentle breezes and the sound of the ocean. Nice (and very clean) pool area overlooking the ocean is the perfect spot to see sea turtles feeding at dawn and dusk. Very helpful manager on site who will take you out snorkeling, if you just ask.\n\nEvery appliance and amenity you need for a relaxing vacation.

Everything was fantastic. From the moment we booked Cynthia could not have been more helpful with everything and was always ready and willing to answer all of our queries. Cynthia provided us with an extensive list of recommendations for our stay on Maui and we were not disappointed. The condo is located in a quiet but convenient neighbourhood and close to many amenities. We found the condo extremely spacious and it accommodated our party of 3 adults and two teenaged children with no problem at all. Cynthia's condo is the penthouse and is set right on the beach so we were treated to gorgeous Hawaiian sunsets every night, as well as being able to see turtles and whales from our balcony. The condo is beautifully presented and very well equipped - we could not have asked for anything more for our nine day stay. \r\nMahalo Cynthia "},{"_id":"139132617","date":{"$date":"2017-03-23T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13934996","reviewer_id":"29101218","reviewer_name":"Alexandra","comments":"The location was great and the view was incredible!

It was really easy to run up to the Condo for my 9-month old nap times or a quick snack, without being too separated from the family.  The onsite pools, restaurant and of course restaurant/bar became our home bases for the week.  Miso Phat Sushi (across the street) and Maui Brewing were awesome near-by/within walking distance restaurants.

During our week long stay, we decided to visit Costco, the local fish market and the farmers market and ate 4 dinners in the condo.  The kitchen has everything you need, and the barbques downstairs were perfect for grilling.  Cynthia left us plenty of information for dining in the vicinity, so we had 3 nice dinners out. The guide she sent us before our visit was very informative and helped us to plan our outings while in Maui. Cynthia also checked in with us during our visit, making sure we had everything we needed.

From the views to the thoughtfulness in everything in the condo. While climbing nine flights of stairs during an unexpected elevator renovation (that ends in May!) does not sound fun, it was actually not bad at all for the adults in our party, as well as the 3 sub-8 year old children, and allowed us to think we were earning all the delicious calories we ate and drank.\n\nI cannot rave enough about the amenities that are incredibly family friendly, including a full sized high chair, travel crib, toddler (and big kid) friendly toys for both indoors and at the beach. Cynthia is very quick to respond to communication and is clear as to what she can provide as a host, as well as her expectation of guests.

Its most important era began with the construction of the Church of Lapa. Rococo and neoclassical building, the Church of Our Lady of Lapa began to be built in 1756 and finished in 1863. Beginning only with a Church, were added a College Seminary, a cemetery, and later, at the beginning of the twentieth century, a hospital. Inside the church, the pipe organ is one of its most impressive pieces, but one of the main attractions of the church is the heart of King Pedro IV, who, since 1837, has been inside an al","notes":"Also I would like to inform that Portuguese immigration services, SEF, require that all non-portuguese guests fill a form with some personal details such as passport number, nationality, etc..

Desde luego NUNCA repetiría una estancia en este apartamento. Reservamos un apartamento para 3 personas pero con capacidad máxima para 4 y una vez aquí solo teníamos ropa de cama y toallas para 2 personas, alegando que la reserva era para 1 huésped, (cabe destacar que el día de la reserva mandamos un (Hidden by Airbnb) para confirmar los datos, mensaje que no fue contestado por el apartamento). Nos dijeron que si queríamos ropa de cama y toallas tendríamos que pagar 20€ y serían llevadas al apartamento en 30minutos. Una vez pagado y dado el retraso con el que se nos entregaron las llaves (no debían esperar que en un fin de semana de Agosto hubiese gente porque el motivo del atraso fue exceso de entradas) decidimos dejar de perder el tiempo y dar una vuelta, esperando, tal y como dijo el chico que entregó las llaves que nos hubiesen llevado todo lo que faltaba a nuestra vuelta. Evidentemente esto no fue así , mandamos otro (Hidden by Airbnb) quejándonos de la situación, mensaje del que aún hoy esperamos respuesta. Por otro lado, la referencia céntrica del apartamento no es real, se encuentra en un barrio bastante cutre de la ciudad y para llegar al centro se debe caminar unos 30 minutos. Por último, con respecto al mensaje, probablemente automático, en el que te dicen que te darán toda la información que necesites a cerca de Oporto es otra falsa. Nosotros solicitamos información sobre un parking donde guardar el coche y el chico que vino no tuvo ni media idea de como indicarnos. La única reseña de Oporto que nos dio fue la de un buen restaurante que no apareció. En conclusión , creo que el comportamiento del apartamento ha sido INADMISIBLE y LAMENTABLE pues lo único que ha hecho ha sido robarnos 20€. HORRIBLE. We would never repit our visit to this apartment. We had booked one apartment for 3 people in one apartment witch maximun capacity was for 4 people and when we arrived , we only had towels and bed clothes for 2 people. The gay that gave as the keys told as that we made the reservation for 1 person and that if we wanted to have extra clothes we had to pay 20€. Althought we had sent a (Hidden by Airbnb) with the characteristics of our booked and they never answered it, we decided to pay and stopped loosing our time. We were going to have a walk around the city and someone would bring us what we paid. When we arrived in the night none had brought us the clothes and we sent them another (Hidden by Airbnb) with no answer. On the other hand, the apartment is a little bit far for city center, no in the heart of the city as they describe.

It is in an amazing location just off Passeig de Gracia, the main shopping street of Barcelona. We could walk quite easily to the Gothic Quarter and Las Rablas, but it's also a minute walk to one of the main metro stations  and where you can also catch a train directly to the airport.  Also, despite it being busy we weren't disturbed by the noise on the street. Especially if you close the bedroom doors while you sleep.\r\n\r\nThe actual apartment is beautiful! It has very classic decor with enormous high ceilings and a well equipped kitchen. It's a new apartment so everything is brand new from the TV to the shower and having a dishwasher was so handy. Not to mention the air conditioner throughout the whole apartment was great to put on after having a sweaty day walking and exploring the city. There was also a nespresso machine which was great, and the store was so nearby we could just walk 20 metres to go and buy more coffee pods.\r\n\r\nThere is also a beautiful area off the living room which has glass walls and is nice to sit in and watch the people of Barcelona walking around.  There are also 2 balconies off the main bedroom which was nice to get fresh air and watch the action of the street below. \r\n\r\nThe sofabed was very comfortable and we had it set up as a bed the whole time we were there and the apartment was still spacious, unlike other apartments I've stayed in where the sofabed takes up the whole living room. The actual bed in the bedroom was ridiculously comfortable, it was amazing.\r\n\r\nAntonio and Roberto were so friendly and helpful! When we arrived Antonio met us and gave us a map of the city and also explained how to get around, what sights we should see and where to get delicious local tapas. One of the restaurants he recommended, Cataluna, served us the most delicious tapas of our entire month in Spain. We went back there 3 times!  \r\n\r\nThis is an amazing apartment, an incredible location to explore the city and with 4 people we were so comfortable and there was more than enough room for us.

It is on the Principal floor, which, on these Eixample buildings, was the noble floor. You will not believe the height of the ceilings and the fantastic refurbished doors and ceilings. Everything is in perfect order and clean. The veranda is a great place to enjoy a glass of wine and read and it brings a fantastic light to the whole space. We were there end of November and the heating worked well with the exception of the bathroom where the small heating equipment for towels was insufficient to warm the room, although we kept it on, it was always cold.\r\nMaribel welcomed us, she was there when we arrived and was both nice and useful. Antonio came to introduce himself a few days later and make sure everything was allright. They're great.\r\nThis was our seventh visit to Barcelona and for us, that Eixample neighborood is ideal. The Rambla de Catalunya is on one corner. You will find lots of restaurants and terraces there and shops. Passeig de Gracia is on the other corner, lots of restaurants there as well and high end boutiques. You can walk from the apartment to all major attractions and interesting neighboroods of this marvelous city.\r\nThere is a great gym called DIRseven on the small passatge Domingo, less than 100 meters from the entrance of the building, where you can either pay everytime you go or take a month subscription (we did, being there for 2 weeks, it was worth it). They have an outdoor pool if you go in the summer and an indoor one as well and offer spa treatments.\r\nThe only downside to the apartment was for us an important one: the noise at night kept us from sleeping as well as we needed. Valencia is a four-lane street, very busy from 6am til 11pm as it is used to reach one the main artery of the city, the Diagonal. The bedroom has one window on Valencia and even if we closed the outside and inside shutters, the noise from the traffic was terribly loud. And drivers here honk their horns a lot! The other bedroom window is on the small Passatge Domingo which looks quiet but becomes animated and very noisy at 1am on weekends. There is a bar, the Hyde, and partygoers go outside to smoke and hang outside. On weekends, we were awake at 6am because people were screaming, laughing, banging on the trash bins. Earplugs didn't do it. The windows really need more isolation to make this place absolutely perfect because everthing else was."},{"_id":"9924242","date":{"$date":"2014-01-20T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1396721","reviewer_id":"7282684","reviewer_name":"Irina","comments":"We stayed at this apartment for the second time and we remained as happy with our stay as the first time.

There is a stunning enclosed balcony that we spent a lot of time in reading and watching the world go by.\r\nThe location is second to none in the Eixample area between Passeig de Gracia and the Rambla De Catalunya. Plenty to see and do in the area. We walked to the Sagrada Familia from here. Could not recommend this apartment highly enough.

Roberto also provided maps and suggestions for local restaurants and grocery shopping. The apartment is as shown in the pictures, spacious and well presented. The location was excellent. We walked everywhere but it was also close to the metro if you want to catch the train. It is only a short 10-15 minute walk to Placa de Catalunya and a 20-25 minute walk to La Sagrada Familia. One of the best features of the apartment is the sun-room where we sat to have our morning coffee and watch Barcelona awake to start the day. The apartment was well equipped with everything you needed for a comfortable stay. The only downside was the lack of tea, coffee, milk and other start up items. We had to go out to the supermarket to stock up. OK when arriving in the day but not convenient if arriving at night.

It is finished to a very high standard with great attention to detail, tastefully decorated and spotlessly clean. The bathroom is delightful and the shower works very well. The enclosed balcony off the sitting room is the perfect spot for breakfast whilst watching the city go by.  The bedroom's french doors are double glazed, making it very quiet.  All the common areas are very clean and tidy as well, and the building has a lift. \r\n\r\nCommunication with the host was perfect. Antonio confirmed the reservation promptly and was always available to answer any queries by email. In Barcelona we were met by his business partner, Roberto, who was very friendly and professional. He showed us the apartment and explaied how everything worked. Roberto was incredibly kind and accommodating (keeping our cases in his office for a few hours as we had a late flight), and also very punctual! \r\n\r\nAnd last but not least, the location is superb! This area of the Eixample is very smart indeed, yet relaxed and welcoming. It is easy to walk to many points of interest in the city - it is only a 10-15 minutes walk to Plaza Catalunya (where the airport bus stops) - and the area is also well served by public transport. There are both posh boutiques and local shops, including a bakery less than a block away on Rambla de Catalunya and a small convenience store down the pedestrian street.  The apartment is only a few minutes walk from Gaudi's Casa Batllo and La Pedrera (great for setting off early to avoid the queues), as well as from Fundacio Tapies and design mecca Vinçon. \r\n\r\nI highly recommend this apartment."},{"_id":"20828091","date":{"$date":"2014-10-06T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1396721","reviewer_id":"12716571","reviewer_name":"Harry","comments":"We were met by Roberto (Antonio's business partner) who was waiting for us as we arrived.

We honesty could not fault it at all. Fantastic huge apartment and hosts. \r\n\r\nOn top of that, as my wife and i reached the apartment very early in the morning where the apartment are still being clean, Antonio and Rosa sat down with us and giving us excellent ideas as of where to go in Barcelona during our stay there.

The room is so nicely decorated and the view is the best. I wouldn't even worry about the rest. \n\nThere are plenty of places to eat nearby that you could walk to. There are also a few eateries on the lobby level. There is a place called \"burger and sushi\" that I suggest you go to if you're looking for a really quick bite. There is also a nice brunch spot downstairs.\n\nSean was easy to communicate with and did a great job hosting us. When we first came in our key card wasn't working, but we called Sean and he quickly dealt with it. \n\nAll in all, it's a great place, not too far or too close to all the touristy things in Waikiki! \n\n"},{"_id":"102645735","date":{"$date":"2016-09-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13981245","reviewer_id":"67291948","reviewer_name":"Ashley","comments":"Awesome room, just enough for the two of us.

Il est propre et très bien localisé dans le quartier de Waikiki.  Il se trouve à environ 15 minutes de marche de la plage de Waikiki et est entouré d'une multitude de restaurants et de boutiques pour tous les goûts.  On a même une très belle vue sur la ville et on peut même voir l'océan à partir de la chambre du 29e étage.  La communication avec Sean était facile.  Pour les 2 derniers jours, nous avons loué une voiture pour visiter un peu plus le reste de l'île.  Nous aurions pu prendre le stationnement à 25$/jour, parce que ça n'est vraiment pas facile de stationner dans Waikiki, mais nous avons choisi de stationner un peu plus loin et nous trouvions des stationnements, avec un peu de difficulté, dans un rayon de 1,5km.  La seule chose que nous pourrions reprocher, c'est que la description de l'appartement disait qu'il y avait une cuisine pour se faire à manger, ce qui est vrai, mais nous n'avions pas vu dans la description qu'il n'y avait pas de grille-pain et de machine à café, alors que, selon moi, une cuisine fonctionnelle devrait avoir ces éléments à la base.  Il y a tout de même une pâtisserie, qui sert aussi du café, dans l'immeuble... ça dépanne.  Malgré ce petit détail, je recommande le studio de Sean, parce que c'est un excellent rapport qualité-prix dans Waikiki."},{"_id":"241346803","date":{"$date":"2018-03-08T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13981245","reviewer_id":"102292782","reviewer_name":"Jamal","comments":"The room was the perfect size for just my wife and I, perfect for any couple looking to explore.

Lounge/dining/kitchen area with table that seats 6. Kitchen fully equipped for a short stay. The apartment was furnished to a high standard, good quality, well looked after and very clean. It’s a 15-20min stroll to the old quarter/port.

We have enjoyed Wailea's luxury resort properties. When we started our family, it was no longer practical to stay in hotels with limited space, compromise security with two separate hotel rooms and incur the food and beverage costs of our growing children. As business travelers we have had the opportunity to visit some of the most amazing cities but none of these locations have come close to the feeling of peace and serenity that we have found in Wailea. Grand Champions Villas is hands down the greatest value in all of Wailea. The central location, beautifully maintained grounds, security and space within the villas cannot be beat. The villa is perfected by a truly beautiful interior with a fresh, relaxing vibe. It was our goal to bring the beauty we saw in the grounds of Wailea to the interior of the villa where we spend time with our family creating cherished memories.

It was clean and well decorated, located in a quiet neighbourhood with a number of nice beaches nearby. The condo's wifi connection gave us no problems, and the owners added the extra touch of giving us access to their netflix account allowing us to relax on the couch after our longs days out exploring. The kitchen was stocked with all the cutley, dishes and pots and pans we could need throughout our stay and dishwasher pods so we didn't have to take time away from vacationing :) The owners also provided us with plenty or towels and beach towels, and other amenities such as a blow dryer. Besides the beaches, I didn't feel that there was too much to do in the close vicinity, but I was still happy with the location as we had plenty of activities planned all over the island, and Waliea-Makena ended up being a relatively central point.

They have set up a crib for us so when we arrived at 2am, we can take our baby straight to bed without much interruption.  We even have some breakfast items readily available to make that morning because we arrived in odd hours of the morning to buy anything.  Just be sure to put all food in the fridge as there are ants who'll fight for your food :-)\n\nThey gave excellent recommendations on a popular shaved ice joint around the corner that Obama visited often as well as a hidden poke gem in a liquor store next to Safeway (also serves best Kalua Pig in town only on Mondays/Wednesdays/Fridays, so much better than Kono's) that only locals know.  The place is also close to Beto's Taco truck which serves delicious Mexican shrimp and fish tacos (I'm from LA and I know what's good) late night for a decent price.\n\nThey have loads of extras,too (bug spray, sun block, shampoo/conditioner, sand toys/chairs/beach umbrellas, beach towels, laundry detergent).  \n\nOverall, we had an excellent experience at Wanda's place and can't wait to go back there next time we're in Oahu."},{"_id":"270937928","date":{"$date":"2018-05-30T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14040723","reviewer_id":"3220152","reviewer_name":"Leigh-Ann","comments":"Wanda's cottage was absolutely perfect.

The apartment is in a basement, dark, with no windows at the entrance, kitchen and bathroom. Needs some fresh air. The bathroom is a bit running out and not clean enough. The room was tiny, dark, and with no closet.\nI had aunts in my room for 3 days. I've also founded objects under the bed and under the shelf from previous guests. Other (Hidden by Airbnb) were also eating my food from the fridge. All the reviews are great, so i don't know if i was unlucky, but i must say that Ivan is a good guy and communication was great. Even if the price was affordable, surely this flat needs to be well organized to be better.

There were other guests staying here in another room but our paths never crossed and I didn't have a chance to meet Ivan in person.  It was a very quiet environment which worked perfectly for me (I was essentially just looking for a place to sleep, get ready in the morning, etc.).

However, I was not aware that there were two other Airbnb guests and no option to lock my door. Thus, I just carried my important belongings throughout my trip. It felt like a security hazard.\n\nI didn’t mind this other issue, but others might. My first morning here, I noticed at least 10-15 ants all along the baseboard and walls of the room. When I texted Ivan about the ants, he said that he would take care of it right away. The next morning when I was scheduled to leave, I noticed more ants along the baseboards of the room. Again, I did not mind this. It is New York and pests are everywhere. However, if you’re deeply concerned about ants or other critters, I would probably avoid this place."},{"_id":"326596958","date":{"$date":"2018-09-22T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14043849","reviewer_id":"12309307","reviewer_name":"Pekka","comments":"I really enjoyed my short stay at Ivan’s place which is located only a short walk from Williamsburg’s restaurants and cafés.

Of course, sitting on the porch looking at the ocean was a favorite activity, between outings to hike, kayak, snorkel and see Kauai.

We concur with one of our daughters who wrote, \"Kim and Wayne were great! They were friendly, helpful and proactive,\"  and with one of our sons-in-law who wrote, \"Wayne was awesome, very friendly and helpful.  He quickly solved any issues we had and was eager to serve.\"\n\nThe house was very comfortable and ideally located, steps from the water.  The view from the living room and master bedroom and deck are wonderful and the hedge around the property affords privacy from the infrequently used one-way street.  Had it not been for the comment of someone driving that road while we were outside, we might have missed the sea turtle swimming in the bay-like area right in front of the house! \n\nThe bedrooms are in different corners of the house and each has its own bathroom so there was plenty of privacy.  The location is almost equi-distant from the North Shore and Waimea/Poipu areas where we enjoyed beautiful beaches and wonderful trails that led to amazing scenery!  The bike trail in front of the house is 7 miles along the coast and a great way to see it and get some exercise.  We didn't spend much time in Kapaa since we were more interested in scenery than 'the scene' but next visit we will spend time exploring it.\n\nThe house is older but nicely decorated and any problems are quickly and satisfactorily resolved by Wayne.  While we were there they kindly purchased snorkel gear for our use, as we expressed an interest in it.  We found them very accomodating, making our stay better than expected.

Excellent communication and great attention to detail. We stayed for 7 days and were traveling with our family of 2 adults, 3 teens and 2 younger children. The floorplan of the house worked really well for us. The description is accurate. Plenty of rooms and bathrooms. The outside shower was especially wonderful! Kim left special items for the family and there were games and small gifts for the kids. The house came with chairs, snorkels, beach towels and ice chests that made our island adventures a breeze. The kitchen is well stocked with everything you might need for meal prep. We even used the outdoor grill. It felt so luxurious to sit out on the deck to eat breakfast and enjoy coffee. The view is wonderful. The beach across from the property is nice, but not the very best for children to swim. However, Lydgate Beach is a 5 minute drive away and perfect for families. Our teens were able to rent bikes for the week and explore some of the island on their own. The central location of the house was ideal for us as we were wanting to drive to other parts of the island, both west and north. Close to the airport, adventures, stores and local shopping \u0026 food. We really enjoyed Street Burger! During our stay we did experience a couple of issues. Rain on the island is pretty typical, but due to a leaking roof, the dining room area became unusable. Our hosts shared this had been an issue, but they thought it was repaired. We also experienced an issue with roaches in several rooms. Wayne did come and put out \"roach motels.\" Other guests might also consider the fact that the home does not have air conditioning. (1 room has a small unit) We knew this, but didn't understand the implications of this for our JULY stay. Even with all the fans going, the house was hot and humid. The weather remained in the 78-84 degree area. Wayne and Kim were responsive to our concerns/ issues. I believe they will continue to strive to improve the stay of their guests."},{"_id":"194390438","date":{"$date":"2017-09-16T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14075164","reviewer_id":"105757255","reviewer_name":"Kathleen","comments":"Great location.

From the first communication, Kim was prompt, caring, open, and made me feel comfortable and excited about our stay. She was amazing about keeping in touch, accommodating our check in and check out needs, and even remembered details about my family and our trip that made us feel special. The home itself was lovely. The location and view are the main selling points. If you want to stay in a comfortable home with ocean views and within walking distance to shops and restaurants, you can’t do better than this. They also included a handy guide with things to do and places to eat so you know where to walk to and what to try (I ALWAYS love local recommendations so this was awesome for me). The house has a lovely Hawaiian beach house feel that is colorful, comfortable, and functional. There was plenty of space for the whole family to gather outside and inside for meals and fun and the bedrooms accommodated everyone very comfortably. We loved that the house was fully stocked with beach towels, snorkel gear, BBQ, condiments, etc. It made it very easy to walk right in and feel at home. It was the epitome of relaxation to be able to enjoy breakfast and dinner out on the lanai while listening to the waves and enjoying the sea breeze. Now let me talk about Wayne and Kim. They are some of the nicest, warmest, most hospitable people you could ever hope to meet. From the warm correspondence to the welcome preparations, we immediately felt like we were being treated like longtime dear friends or even family. Kim was ALWAYS accessible via text or phone if questions or concerns popped up, and talking to Kim was so easy, at times I would forget that we had only just met through Air Bnb. Wayne stopped by and introduced himself as well and we felt very comfortable with his presence and warmth. They handle their rental properties with real Aloha spirit and professionalism. They truly are rare gem human beings. From the moment we walked in the door, my family already started planning our next trip to Kaua‘i... a trip that we now can’t imagine making without staying at Wayne and Kim’s. Mahalo for everything, Wayne and Kim!

The home is definitely older but so charming and updated with everything you need and more. Kim \u0026 Wayne left a beautiful welcome surprise for our group. I loved that the home has so much character and open space. We were visiting Kaua'i for a family memorial and were rained out at every venue the entire weekend. We were able to hang out comfortably with our family and have a lot of space to relax. We even met a lot of the neighbors and would meet up for sunrise with the local fishermen at the beach and talk while drinking our coffee. The best surprise was the local monk sea that would visit the little beach right across the street and frolic in the water before sunning on the reef. Great place for family, friends, adults and children alike!!! We hope to come back and stay again."},{"_id":"254952123","date":{"$date":"2018-04-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14075164","reviewer_id":"27501966","reviewer_name":"Leah","comments":"The place was great!

No schlepping food, diapers or extra anything!  We didn't even bring towels as we would just go back to the house to the outdoor shower and throw a towel on after!  \n\nThe beach is perfect for littles who aren't swimming yet!  Our daughter is such a water baby and loved splashing around in the shallow water,  and we loved that we could give her the freedom to explore! \n\nThe house has a fantastic deck overlooking the water and wonderful lanai if dining indoors is your preference!  It's not air conditioned, but we never found that to be an issue. Even during naps it was cool enough, and a small give to get such a wonderful home with wonderful hosts. \n\nWayne and Kim are lovely and incredibly accommodating!

Aside from a few areas of the house that could use some updating, it was just what we needed!  Super cute home, with all of the amenities to do some living for the week. The kitchen was stocked with spices, oils and other things to cook with. The beach chairs, umbrellas and coolers helped us have great days at the beach. We stayed with another couple and had such a lovely time sitting on the deck, watching the ocean and the stars, cooking together (and drinking, too! the blender comes in handy), and eating (and drinking :) ) on the lanai. The beds were comfortable, there's a nice breeze most times of the day, and there are fans throughout. The location is fantastic! Aside from day trips out, we walked most of the time - to eat (Lemongrass, J02, Sam's Ocean View, Olympic Cafe), to massages (try (Website hidden by Airbnb) - AMAZING), to the beach (SO CLOSE!!), to shop in the downtown Kapa'a shops, and to grab odds and ends at the Big Save. Safeway is a super quick drive, too (their poke is surprisingly good!). Most of all, Wayne and Kim were delightful hosts and I'm so grateful for opportunity to meet them stay at their home.

None of us had been to Kauai before and booking accommodation sight unseen for a ten-day stay with a gang like ours was an act of faith. We chose Oceanfront Harmony because the layout included separate living spaces for three families, and it was next to a bike path/quiet road and across from a baby-suitable beach. The accommodation and location turned out to be even more perfect for us than we imagined. It’s a short walk not just to the beach, but also to shopping and dining - and the bike path is a terrific walking trail that extends along the coast. The house is part of a small subdivision and the neighbours are friendly and welcoming. The layout of the house allowed us to have both together time and quiet time for babies (and parents) to nap. We dined in a lovely screened-in dining room and had drinks on the deck with a view of the ocean. Our hosts, Wayne and Kim went beyond our expectations at every level – including an extravagant welcome basket, a well equipped kitchen with lots of cooking basics, as well as many beach supplies including chairs, towels, toys, and an umbrella. They had wonderful suggestions for places to eat and sights to see. To top it off, we had expected to rent high chairs and sleeping cots for the babies and instead Wayne and Kim bought two of each to add to their guest supplies. Oceanfront Harmony was a spectacular place to stay and we lacked for nothing"}]}

Now myself, my mother Brenda, my wife Kristina, and my aunt Lucy have taken over the reins and are continuing the legacy my grandmother started. \r\n\r\nOur families journey in the vacation rental industry started with one small simple unit and slowly evolved into something special for generations to come. We now we have 3 vacation rental properties in Kailua with multiple units on each. Our goal is to offer parties of all sizes the chance to visit our island paradise without having to break their bank accounts. We have 2, 3, \u0026 4 bedroom units for larger groups or extended family getaways.

Jared does warn that parking is expensive (he mentions $69 in the apartment description) but what I didn't realise is it's not just a $69 flat rate for more than three hours, it's $69 the first day, $50 overnight, then $69 for the next day. In the end we just gave up trying to find cheaper parking and paid. Other than that our stay was wonderful. Thank you Jared for being a wonderful host!

The room had probably one of the most comfortable beds I've been on haha. I the only big thing that I advice or maybe they could improve was parking (I know it wasn't mention), I got a rental and it was difficult finding parking overnight in the city that wasn't over priced. I assume since it was a studio the apartments probably had their own parking but that wasn't the case. Overall I Recommend the place.

Bring your own hand towel and wash cloth if you use one.  Also, it's on a heavily used road and the noise is constant.  Light sleepers won't rest well.

We caught the train from the airport to Circular Quay and it was only a 5 minute walk to the apartment. The only drawback was luggage storage - we were unable to leave our bags before check-in time. This is understandable, given that it is an airbnb and not a hotel, however it was an inconvenience and added cost for us to use public luggage storage. The check-in process was easy and the apartment itself was perfect for a weekend away. Very small and basic but the bed was comfortable and the location couldn't be beaten.

The place is clean, with every basic thing provided. We did not cook though, so we were not able to use the oven. It was a bit cold though during some nights since it's winter \u0026 we were not able to find a heater. Tried to adjust the thermostat to 20 degrees but it turns off. It's more of an airconditioner. But it was fine \u0026 we didn't bother to ask Jared anymore since we are outside most of the time. I highly recommend this place in Sydney.

I have read about other feedbacks about noises. As for me, I felt the noise level was not as loud as what others claimed. Since we were living right at the heart of the CBD, we do not expect total silence like living in a cave. We actually enjoyed the random sound of siren from ambulance, party-goers chiming to Christmas songs. It really represents a true heart of a city!\nA big thumb up for the cleanliness of the places. Not a insect to be found! The air-con system was great! \nDiscover that there is no shower curtain. Not sure if it is to deter people from taking long shower.

There was left over dirt on the carpet (bits and pieces, food, pieces of crayon) when we arrived. \nThe bathroom needs to be stripped out and replaced, there are tiles missing, the bath tub is in terrible condition, there’s visible mold, the shower screen does nothing and you end up with a completely wet and slippery bathroom floor every time it’s used. \nThere’s a bunch of exposed wires that have been carelessly taped to a skirting board in the kitchen area, fun when there’s a crawling baby exploring the place!\nAir con, while it worked great, the dial is broken so its hard to know when it’s on or off.\n\nI’d recommend a set of ear plugs for anyone staying here as there’s road works outside at the moment so there’s a bit of noise, as well as the apartment sharing a wall with the elevator shaft and a fair bit of noise coming from the roof (top floor apartment). \n\nOverall we had a great trip but for the money we spent we could have stayed in a nicer Airbnb (as we have in Sydney before)."},{"_id":"247550321","date":{"$date":"2018-03-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14096512","reviewer_id":"44348956","reviewer_name":"Kameron","comments":"Great Location for those wanting to spend a night enjoying the Sydney Night Scene.

Alternatively, getting a taxi was super easy (download the Hail O app!) and only cost about 10-12 euros. \nWe would all love to return and can hopefully do so :) \n"},{"_id":"96331944","date":{"$date":"2016-08-22T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1410802","reviewer_id":"63503758","reviewer_name":"Mathieu","comments":"Attention aux photos tapageuses ! Nous étions quatre amis à avoir réservés cette maisonnette pour notre séjour à Barcelone de trois jours. Nous ne sommes restés que une nuit, préferant perdre notre argent,  tellement nous avons été déçus par cette location. Plusieurs raisons à cela: \n- La localisation. Pleine zone industrielle, odeur nauséabonde à notre arrivée, 25 minutes de bus du centre-ville.\n- La piscine. Point central de notre réservation, la photo qui la représente sur l'annonce est clairement un trompe-l'oeil. Nous appellerions ça plutôt un bassin, étant donné qu'il ne doit pas dépasser les 4m carré. De plus, elle etait dans un état de propreté lamentable ( nous en sommes ressortis les pieds tout noirs après 5 minutes à faire trempette).\n_ L'ensemble du logement. Pour le prix affiché, nous nous attendions a trouver une literie de qualité. En guise de cela, de simples matelas à ressorts, et au réveil de multiples boutons de piqures. De plus, l'ensemble est bien moins attrayant en réalité qu'en photo (Finitions bas de gamme, simple vitrage).\n\nEn résumé, nous avons la désagréable sensation de s'être fait avoir en bonne et due forme, tellement le décalage entre l'annonce et la réalité est terrible. Nous ne pouvons que vous conseiller de passer votre chemin, vous trouverez bien mieux au même prix ailleurs à Barcelone, n'en doutez pas !"},{"_id":"102783078","date":{"$date":"2016-09-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1410802","reviewer_id":"7777403","reviewer_name":"Steven","comments":"We had a great time at the White House and the kids loved the pool ! The house itself is spacious and all amenities were available as listed. The wifi connection is great. On the negative side, the house smelt a bit of paint when we arrived, presumably because paint works were recently done, and we had some trouble with non-functioning light bulbs, but nothing serious. The neighborhood is a bit isolated (with lots of car and metal workshops nearby) but very quiet, and the bus service to the center of town is excellent. There's one supermarket in the immediate vicinity where we could buy all groceries we needed. Overall, we would definitely consider coming back to the White House on our next trip to Barcelona !"},{"_id":"109546297","date":{"$date":"2016-10-22T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1410802","reviewer_id":"1903354","reviewer_name":"Barbara","comments":"The house is very nice for a group of friends, its outside the city, for traveling by car it's perfect.

My friends were the first who arrived and asked if they could stay on the last day little longer because their flight back was taking of at evening.

Tonnes of restaurants, stores, the beach etc within walking distance.\n\n-Apartment is exactly as pictured. Very clean and a great size for our family (4 adults and 2 kids). The open concept is also great especially if you have kids.\n\n-Captain Cook is extremely professional and very responsive. They will work hard to accommodate your every need. The service was so good it was almost as if we were staying in a hotel.\n\n-They provided everything we'd need for the beach. Including boogie boards, a beach umbrella and beach chairs. There was even a playpen there for the baby. Unfortunately the beach umbrella they provided was damaged though. I forgot to report it but I'm sure they would have replaced it if I did.\n\nCONS\n\n- The washer and dryer weren't as powerful as expected. Especially the dryer, so be prepared to do very small loads (max 5 pieces of clothing).We had to run the dryer several times just to dry simple loads such as our swimwear. They did provide a drying rack however so we were able to utilise it on the lanai.\n\n- Only two keys were provided with the apartment. Typically this wouldn't have been a problem but with 4 adults it kinda got a little tricky. Especially if you want to do your own thing. Mainly so because you're not able to access the Penthouse from the elevator without a key. (You also can't enter the building after 10 o clock if you don't have a key). That pretty much meant that we had to do everything together or 1 person would have to wait at home with a key in order to let you in. We made it work but I think at least 3 keys would be ideal for a place that sleeps 6.\n\nOverall, this was an amazing apartment and Captain Cook's made our stay that much better with their professional service. It's definitely worth the price and we would all book with them again in a heartbeat.

The area is full of houses of eclectic Ottoman liberty style buildings and ours is one of them. By the 1950’s most of the greek population of the area had to immigrate to Greece because of political reasons.  The area was deserted and by the 1980’s got an internal immigration from the east part of Turkey mostly of Kurdish origin.

Elle connait Istanbul comme sa poche. La chambre est au dernier étage, elle est calme et douce. Elle a un accès direct sur la terrasse ce qui permet de bouquiner avant d'aller dormir ou de faire un peu de yoga le matin. Le quartier est au coeur de Beyoglu avec une foultitude de restaurants et de bonnes adresses à découvrir. Si vous hésitez encore à réserver, n'hésitez plus !

Es ist immer was los und selbst wenn mankein türkisch kann,Fatma Abla versucht mit English und Händen und Füßen zu reden. Eine unglaublich sympathische und unterhaltsame Dame, die ich sehr schnell ins Herz geschlossen habe. Sonntags sind wir zusammen zum Bio Bazar gelaufen und an einigen Tagen kochen wir sogar was zusammen.  Mein Zimmer befindet sich im obersten Stock, wo ich komplett meine Ruhe habe. gegenüber von meinem Zimmer ist eine wunderschöne Terasse, die zum Yoga machen oder ein Buch lesen einlädt. Gäste sind auch immer willkommen. Fatma hat ihre eigenen Stil, welches dem ganzen Haus, bis auf den Eingangsbereich, einen unglaublichen charm gibt. Jedes Zimmer ist individuell und man muss sagen, dass bis her die Leute, die ich im Haus kennengelernt habe, echt toll sind. Wenn man sich für Fatma entscheidet, sollte man auf alle Fälle kulturoffen sein und sich diesem schönen antiken Stil und der Nostalgie einfach fallen lassen. Ich bin durch Fatma und durch die Wohnung in einem alten Istanbul angekommen und fühle mich super wohl. Zu meiner Arbeit in Cihangir laufe ich täglich zu Fuß. Die Lage ist sehr perfekt. Ich brauche kaum Bus oder Bahn zu benutzen, da ich alles in Beyoglu und Taksim finde, was ich brauche. Nur für meine Touristentour habe ich lediglich die Bahn benutzt. Obwohl man zum Eminönu auch zu Fuß laufen kann, wenn man spazieren gehen mag. Ich danke Dir, Fatma abla, so wie ich dich gerne zu nennen pflege, für Deine Offenheit und Deine Wärme. Ich werde Dich sehr bald wieder besuchen kommen und hoffentlich sogar mein altes Zimmer beziehen im obersten Stock.

The house is great, very typical and nice - as a bonus, the bathrooms were all renovated and they look fantastic. The terrace made for many evenings relaxing away from the hustle and bustle of Istiklal St. In terms of location, the house is in a great spot: seconds away from Istiklal, minutes from Taksim and the cool Cihangir area, and a short train ride or longer walk to Sultanahmet, Topkapi and all the tourist sites. Would recommend without any hesitation, as I already did to two friends of mine who also stayed at Fatma and Hasan's house.

I hope that my turkish will be better one day so that we can have longer and deeper conversations!

Other than that, location is very convenient in terms of transportation and main tourist attractions. \n\nThanks Fatima and Co!"},{"_id":"346045346","date":{"$date":"2018-11-07T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1413677","reviewer_id":"972941","reviewer_name":"Quintal","comments":"Fatma's house is a great place to stay.

The picture of the view does not do it justice. It is even more beautiful in person.

And they have binoculars to help you enjoy the whales.\nOn top of this amazing view you get a fully stocked kitchen along with a reusable ice pack for the cooler that they supply.

Very easy to get to Kapalua, Whalers Village, and Lahaina. Walking distance to some small restaurants but didn’t manage to visit this time. I knew ahead of time, but beach area is mostly sandbags. However, most places in this price range don’t offer access to safe swimming beach, so that wasn’t an issue and knew before I arrived. The condo has many locals that clearly all know each other. It was really fun to watch sunset with them one night-they all blow on conch shell at sunset and it’s a hoot! Pool was nicely situated to maximise sun throughout day (although shady spots as well). Condo has everything you need and great Lana’i for coffee in AM or bad weather (we had a horrible wind storm but somehow it was still fine for sitting on Lana’i). Great views of water-tons of whale action some of the days."},{"_id":"417050229","date":{"$date":"2019-02-25T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14150800","reviewer_id":"47806992","reviewer_name":"Kalifa","comments":"Had a wonderful time at Sherry’s home.

The house is advertised as being in bug-friendly Maui, so I expected some bugs. We have them where we live and most everyone does, so no big deal, right? However, when we first arrived we immediately noticed a bunch of wasps in the house. Bug-friendly to me means you’ll probably see some mosquitoes, roaches, or ants, not an infestation of wasps (I estimated close to 40 flying, on walls, or crawling on the floors during our stay). My kids were kids, and having fun counting them. The majority of the wasps were in the upstairs bedroom that we intended to use for our two little kids. We called the host and she sent her husband to vacuum up the wasps. That's all he did. He basically told us it’s to be expected and gave us no apology. He left and we inspected and immediately saw more. Over the next day we complained to her again, and finally to Airbnb. The company agreed that the place was unsuitable and immediately refunded our cleaning fee after seeing pictures of the place. The host responded by booting us out of the rental two days in. We were polite and tried to fix things in a civil manner (the main complaint was really just the wasp infestation), and we didn’t complain about anything else. We weren't prissy babies and don't really care about minor problems. But wasps flying around the rental and in your kids' room can cause some concern. Apparently, the host didn't like our complaint and saw fit to have us vacate and find lodging elsewhere for the next few nights. Imagine staying in a hotel, for example, complaining about a bug problem and having the management kick you out instead of trying to fix the issue. Crazy, right? We agreed, however, leaving the place in good order (cleaned the dishes, took out the trash and recycling, and even folded up used blankets and such). There's no reason to return pettiness with pettiness, I suppose. After that “customer is always wrong” treatment we felt it was fine anyway. Unfortunately, the host refused to refund our remaining 2 days of unused time. We stayed 2 of the 4 days at the host's request and we still got charged for 4 days. After nearly two weeks of no effort on her part to refund us, she is just now saying that we damage her bedding but is providing no details or proof. Anyway, that’s our experience. No aloha in the land of aloha really sucks, but it happens and I can’t be too bothered by it. Here are the pros and cons of the place (fairly, I hope): Pros: *super quiet – out in the middle of the country. Middle of nowhere = nice and quiet. There are tons of big pitbulls as you ride down the 2 mile dirt road to the house, but even those guys..."},{"_id":"127623558","date":{"$date":"2017-01-19T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14152437","reviewer_id":"78953092","reviewer_name":"Nicole","comments":"This cottage was in a quiet neighborhood close to town; secluded enough to relax after a long day of adventures.

Every detail was charming and one could sense she had gone to a lot of effort to make her place welcoming. After spending time in other parts of Maui, it was a relief to arrive \"home\" to this seemingly secluded, lush paradise. Most of our time was spent on the deck; the wind blowing through the tropical plants, the occasional rain, all served as a soothing (and at other times exhilarating) backdrop to our activities. Then there are the animals. My children delighted in the tame free range chickens roaming about, as well as the geckos and rabbit. We were able to spend about half an hour with Kandy, who was rushing from one thing to the next, but generously took time to show us around her property and even offered us some of the ripened fruit available. We would have loved to spend more time with her, but our schedules never matched up. Perhaps next time?

We traveled to Maui with our two small children, almost 3 year old son and 8 month old daughter.  Our stay at Kandide’s cottage was excellent!  She’d purchased a crib for the cottage and for us to use during our stay. It was a super cozy location tucked away in the jungle with little ocean views sneaking into a couple windows.  It was so great to have all that we needed to make our meals at home!  We did breakfast and dinner at the cottage, and packed lunches/snacks for our beach and adventure days.  Kandide had tons of info on places to visit on the island with our two little people.  Traveling with kids it was great to have the comforts of home, but on a more simplified level.  We didn’t mind the drive to activities, it was part of our plan...if we stay on the beach or a place with a pool we knew we’d never leave and explore!  This cottage welcomed you and invited you in, but also helped you to be eager to start the day.  I think it’s due to the comforts of home and almost immediately feeling settled in.  Our son said it perfectly on our last morning at the cottage while having breakfast before heading to the airport, “This place is just right for our family.”  It sure was, buddy!  We’d definitely stay here with Kandide again and certainly recommend it to those looking for a truly special experience while in Maui!"},{"_id":"266948185","date":{"$date":"2018-05-20T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14152437","reviewer_id":"15633723","reviewer_name":"Algis","comments":"Great relaxing place to stay.

One person said they think they saw a rat running around kitchen (I didn’t see it so I’m giving the benefit of doubt)  and another person had a gecko land on top of them. WiFi signal very poor (I didn’t care much for it because I wanted to be disconnected, but the other three folks wanted their WiFi) The place itself is really gorgeous. If you want to get away and enjoy the rural life this is a great place. I have to say I was really looking forward to staying here. It’s definitely clean and provides so much great aesthetic touches.

The screened in lanai, layout, and nice touches (good kitchen knives, crib, ukulele, etc) all made our stay very enjoyable. Good place if you're looking for a low key stay in the upcountry, and have a healthy tolerance for insects/critters. If you've never stayed in the upcountry but decide to give it a go, just remember that you're more or less staying in the jungle and (especially with a house this size) you are likely to have some 'house guests'. We passed a couple suggestions on to the owner regarding minimal maintenance items.  It is worth noting that none of us received a single bug bite while in the house.

It's a great place to be if you want to drive the Hana road, and it's close to Makawao and Paia, both great, little communities with wonderful boutique shops. There are some trade-offs bc of the location -- really slow wifi, bringing all our own water (house runs on catchment system), not near any beaches -- but worth it to experience the other side of Maui.

It was a peaceful Hawaiian retreat! We enjoyed just sitting on the couch and looking out at the water, or watching the sunset. The Cabana was thoughtfully filled with everything we needed and more. We only had to go out and buy food to cook. The Cabana was only a few minutes away from a lot of the activities we wanted to do; Koko Head Trail and Hanauma Bay were less than 10 minutes away! Sarah and her family were very welcoming and thoughtful hosts. On our arrival, we were welcomed with some Hawaiian treats, and throughout our stay, they checked in to see if we needed anything. We stayed at the Cabana during a week when there were two hurricane warnings issued for Oahu, and Sarah came by to assure us that they had enough food/water and a plan if we had to evacuate.

The entire house opens up to the bay and the backyard, allowing the relaxing tradewinds to breeze thru and naturally cool the house, even without the multiple ceiling fans and AC in the loft. Every convenience and luxury has been considered, from the remote-controlled fans and sunshades to the brand new appliances, cooking and entertaining supplies and outdoor dining set. We were so enamored with the view, we never turned on the TV - this space is as close to sleeping on the actual water as I can imagine. Sarah, her husband Curtis, and their adorable children were warm, helpful and easy to communicate with, readily sharing tips for local stores, scenic hikes and North Shore snorkeling spots for our trip.

We were a family of four and we were all very comfortable. Everyday I looked forward to coming home to the cabana! Every amenity was there, and we needed nothing. But we knew that if we did, Sarah was always there to provide anything we needed. \r\nWe came during Thanksgiving, and she invited us to her feast, we met so many wonderful people there! We felt as if we were part of the neighborhood, and a part of her wonderful family! (The kids are so cute!) \r\nI wish I could keep it a secret so I could book this every time I come back, but everyone  coming to Honolulu that wants to stay close enough to the city to access it, but  away from it to experience living in Hawaii, should stay in this cabana. It is peaceful, charming, and beautiful. I felt very safe and had lots of privacy, so much so that when I come back by myself to drop my son off for college, I will book this cabana(if I can get it!) because the neighborhood is quiet and very safe. \r\nThe cabana has shopping nearby, less than a mile, so you can get groceries, eat, and there is fishing and water sports nearby.

I'd booked stand alone homes before, but never had the owner there, so I was a little wary. But as the other reviews mentioned, Sarah knows just when to appear and when to give guests space; we had all the privacy we could have wanted and once ensconced in the bungalow, it was as if we were in our own private world. \n\nWe loved fully opening the sliding doors and letting the warm trade winds flow through the house, even on rainy days. The wind, the lapping waves, the occasional drizzle and pounding of rain made for a most contemplative setting. Forget the Headspace app, I just closed my eyes and meditated! But when my eyes were open... wow, what a view! My son enjoyed fishing along the lanai. He saw a puffer fish and a barracuda!\n\nI would say that the bungalow fits 4 comfortably: One person in the loft, two in the queen bed downstairs and one (or maybe two kids) in the living room sofa bed. Three would be ideal, but 4 is doable. The loft is for the able-bodied and sure-footed, as the stairs are not for the clumsy or the feeble. It's also an open-floor plan, no floor to ceiling interior wall between the bathroom and bedroom and no floor to ceiling walls on two sides of the loft (and the bathroom has no door) -- so just beware that sound travels! \n\nThe bungalow is sparkling clean! There's no overload of tchotchkes to get dusty and in the way. The house has all that you need, but not clutter. Having a washer/dryer just outside was the best, especially since I have boys!\n\nThe location was convenient to grocery stores (Safeway, Costco) and restaurants. Nine minutes away from Hanauma Bay and minutes away from the original Roy's. I compared my experience at Sarah's bungalow with that of my friend's, who stayed in a Waikiki hotel during that same week and I have to say, my friend was jealous! \n\nSarah and her family were warm and accommodating, approachable and casual. The three children are absolutely adorable.

Everything was perfect : the kitchen, the bedrooms (one with bathroom = suite), the kids playroom on last floor, the garden ! The agencement of this house is a success !\nBesides, the house is very close from the beach (5 min by walk) and from any commodations you need during your holidays. For example, a supermarket is located less than 200m from the house.\nTo be noticed : You can also rent this house without renting a car : metro and bus station are close too. You can reach Porto city center easily with metro.\nIt's  definitely a perfect house if you want to do in the same day : surfing, chill and shopping.\nThen, André was very convenient before our coming, trying to do his best to help us. The welcoming was really warmful.\nFor sure, we recommend André's house."},{"_id":"154595283","date":{"$date":"2017-05-25T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14175496","reviewer_id":"129472985","reviewer_name":"João","comments":"Casa bastante bem localizada com decoração moderna e muito agradável.

It has a modern, clean, yet cozy feeling to it. We had our 2 year old with us and he loved the playroom on the 3rd floor. In fact, he never wanted to leave. He also enjoyed the many toys that were in his bedroom. If you have a toddler-elementary age child, I can say with confidence that they would love to stay here. Keep in mind there are 3 floors so there are a good bit of stairs but that did not bother us and our kid learned not to climb them without us. The place also has a great little backyard. We got to enjoy it on the last day and it was nice to sit out there with coffee and pastries and enjoy the breeze. It is about a 7-8 minute walk to the beach and the closest beach area is the widest part in Praia de Matosinhos and has the most cafes. Downtown Porto is about a 15 minute uber ride which was very convenient. Overall, we really loved the place and if we were to come back we would most definitely choose André's house again.

The studio doesn't come with parking but I never had a issue with that. I was always able to find parking in the surrounding area or on ala wai blvd but be careful not to park there Mon and Fri morning learned that the hard way. If you don't like the hassle of looking for parking Honolulu zoo offers convenient parking at a dollar an hour and let's you add more time from your phone and is only a five minute walk from the studio. if youre staying for a week or longer I recommend the Waikiki banyan parking it's right across the street from the studio but be cautious if you have a tall vehicle you won't fit ( had a wrangler and didn't fit). I highly recommend for anyone wanting to stay in Waikiki to check this place out. only negative thing I have to say is lack of stove top for home cooking, but it won't be needed with all the onolicious food in the island."},{"_id":"96826969","date":{"$date":"2016-08-24T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14186262","reviewer_id":"86235901","reviewer_name":"Rod","comments":"Plenty of communication in advance.

It has a large fridge, I believe it is too large for the small room. When it is working, it is loud and disturbing, which shouldn't be a problem if it wouldn't be right in front of the bed. I would change it for a smaller and quieter one. The room gets really hot even in winter, but if you open the door, neighbors might walk in front of your bed, as the room is on the ground floor, next to the private coin laundry situated at the back of the building. It has an A/C unit, but it cannot substitute fresh air. Maybe a curtain on the door would solve that airing problem. You might need your own beach equipment, beach towels, chairs, etc. The kitchen equipment is very basic, there were only bowls, no plates for example. The unit has a combined microwave/oven, so even if you pack full your large fridge, you won't be able to cook too much. There were no sponge for dishwashing. But for its price, you will hardly find a better place in downtown Waikiki. Besides these things, we enjoyed our stay, and it is really close to everything. If you plan to spend your whole day visiting Waikiki and nearby places, and only return to the room for sleeping, it is going to be fine. It was clean, and Kai was really good at communication. Always answered to every messages in minutes. Wifi was fast enough. We didn't have a car for a long period, so we didn't have to hassle with parking, but it could be a problem, although as I have seen, in nearby streets there were usually few free places, so I believe you will find one spot eventually, in few minutes walking distance."},{"_id":"129054365","date":{"$date":"2017-01-29T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14186262","reviewer_id":"86398191","reviewer_name":"Kris","comments":"We had a wonderful stay at Kai's place.

The size of the studio was perfect for two adults, and the laundry access really helped us out as far as how much to pack! We used under the bed for some extra storage as well! Kai was very attentive to us and any extra need we had.

Sure there is no view, but the place is walking distance to Waikiki beach!  And I am not talking about a hike, I am talking about a flip-flop walk away.\nKai was over the top responsive to all of our needs.  Extremely welcoming, and you felt \"aloha\" the minute you got there.  Judge for yourself how many can stay here, it was just my wife and I. I could imagine taking two young kids with us, but not more than that.\nThe studio had every detail one would need for a trip. I particularly loved the fact that there were power outlets EVERYWHERE!  No need to share an outlet, or have to plug your phone on the other side of the room.\nA/C worked great (we were there in January, so we actually turned it off most of the time).  Furniture is small (which is GOOD) so as to not take up too much space.\nThe neighborhood is nice and the walk to the beach is short and easy.\nRide sharing is everywhere and convenient, no need to rent a car here.\nKai's instructions are VERY clear, don't get overwhelmed with the amount of information, he just wants you to know all the details.\nWhile there, we had a power outage (an idiot probably had too much to drink and ran into a pole), I contacted Kai, and he had contacted the power company and got back to me within minutes with an estimated wait time!  I can't get that kind of service at home!!!\nKai, you are TRULY a great host.  Mahalo, mahalo...

Due to its location in a prime dining \u0026 bar area one has to cope with a decent noise level during the nights (we were not surprised by that, though), but you cannot have it all ...\r\nOne has to get accustomed to the steep and narrow stairs, however ... we were fortunate to have two youngsters with us who offered to carry our suitcases up to the fourth floor ...; no problem without heavy luggage, of course.\r\nLeaving the place on a friday evening 6 p.m. we should have been prepared for a longer taxi ride to JFK airport ... took some time to get a cab, and at least half an hour for the first 1/4 mile (75 min for the whole ride), so the 90 min we had considered plenty of time turned out to be narrow planning.\r\n"},{"_id":"6965368","date":{"$date":"2013-09-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"141890","reviewer_id":"6827969","reviewer_name":"Spartaco","comments":"Good apartment and good location.

This neighborhood was exactly where I wanted to be. You have everything you need and want within a 3 block radius. I loved having Allison's apartment as an oasis to return to after dealing with the crowds.\r\nI liked the 4th floor walk up because it makes it quieter. I honestly hope Allison's apartment will be available for my next trip to NYC. I would definitely stay here again. We were 3 adults and two children, so Allison didn't mind that we childproofed the apartment for her.

Roomy and clean, with all the essentials, and appropriate for up to two couples.  Alison was very responsive, though we didn't really need anything.  It is a 4th (top) floor walk-up and there is no elevator, but it wasn't an issue for us.  The rooms' windows face the street and there is typical street traffic, deliveries, etc. in the morning.  Nothing wrong with that if you're used to city apartments below 6 stories.\r\n\r\nWe visited while the temperature was very mild, and it was comfortable using just the overhead fans.\r\n\r\nThe neighborhood is really, really great - lots of places to eat and shop nearby, subway very close.\r\n\r\nOverall recommended for a downtown experience.

The apartment looks ok but it is a bit run down. The TV didn't work, there was no toaster and having a shower was a mission. We would get 1 minute of hot water followed by 15-20 minutes of freezing cold then hot again, so taking a shower was a half hour process. I also thought the apartment was dirty, the bath and shower curtain especially was disgusting and slimy, and there was a sticky stain next to the bed, yuk! Also the hosts' correspondence was prompt but her main concern was that we drop off and prepay for the laundry (as we agreed in advance) of the towels and bedding on our last day, as she made sure to remind us about 5 times. I wouldn't stay here again, I don't live in luxury but I'm so glad to be home. "}]}

Sam et Britney sont des hôtes très sympathiques ;  ils nous ont gardé nos valises après le check out et même appelé un taxi pour l'aéroport.  Vous pouvez réserver les yeux fermés."},{"_id":"262923955","date":{"$date":"2018-05-10T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14214403","reviewer_id":"65478849","reviewer_name":"Sandra","comments":"The apartement is great. My only suggestion is to bring snacks, water for late nite munchies since there are no many places open and close by. You will be away from the big city but you are in a quiet vecinity if you are to rest. There are to close stations and can take aprox 40 mins to hit the city. Beds are super comfy.  My only concern was that there is nothing to do around if you just want to walk around. But in general, it is a good place to stay."},{"_id":"264232044","date":{"$date":"2018-05-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14214403","reviewer_id":"175908013","reviewer_name":"Del","comments":"This apartment was immaculately clean, modern, quiet, and close to the subway.

The place is wonderfully clean, and offers plenty of places to sit, and a beautiful kitchen to cook in. We went to the Key Foods a couple of subway stops away for a big grocery haul and then stopped at nearby bodegas for fresh fruit and bagels as needed when we ran out. The area is safe, and the street is quiet. The back patio is awesome as well! All in all, we would recommend this place, and we would love to stay here again. Our only thought is the closest subway line and provides the quickest access to Manhattan, the L, was shut down the weekend we were there. We ended up getting creative with connecting buses to different train lines, or just taking a lot of Lyfts, but this may not be convenient for everyone.

Host even provided some snacks, keurig coffee pods, cold soda, oatmeal, and hot cocoa that the kids loved. Cute backyard patio, though we didn’t enjoy due to cold weather. The neighborhood had restaurants/deli shops/bars/good markets within a few minutes walking distance. We felt like locals. We were a short walk away from the L line that took us everywhere into the nyc tourists spots and also back to JFK airport. We felt safe walking late at night from metro and some local bars back to the apartment. Definitely recommend Father Knows Best for breakfast and for late late night drinks. Also around the corner is Bushwick Taco Company. My son even got a nice haircut at the local barber shop. So if you are looking for a nice place to relax after a day full of sightseeing and get that true New York feel this is the place for you. Also realized that customer service at the local eateries was 100% better than the customer service we experienced in Manhattan. Will definitely come back again. \nOh, there was also a washer and dryer but we didn’t use it as well as Free Netflix.

I rented his room for Labor Day weekend while attending a music festival at Randall's Island Park. \n\nMy review will be as detailed as possible. I gave him a perfect review based on whether what I expected was provided. As a man that doesn't need to much and is happy with what I am given, Ramazan's apartment did just that. The shower worked just fine (he even provided me some travel shampoo/conditioner/lotion), and he lent me a shower towel (which was incredibly soft, just how I like) for the weekend. I don't need anything too fancy/complex when I sleep, so the bed in the apartment was satisfactory. It was, of course, furnished with sheets and a thicker blanket, as well as a pillow. It was a bit on the hot side in terms of the weather, but luckily there was a fan in the room that worked wonders, so that made my sleep much easier. Basically, the room is just as pictured, and was just what I needed. If you're a picky resident, you might find an issue or two, but as I said, I'm a man of simple taste, so this was just perfect for me. \n\nThe apartment looked pretty nice as well! I didn't use much of the general lounge space, but it looked very well set-up, and Ramazan was always happy to offer me usage of his TV if I so wanted (which I didn't, as I was pretty busy with my trip). \n\nI came to the city this weekend specifically for the music festival, so each night I had to come back home late. There was no issue with that, he was okay with my late returns, access to the apartment was easy, and I could take my exhausted self right to bed after a late night without any issue. \n\nRamazan himself was an incredibly kind and thoughtful person. When he was around while I was about to go off on my adventures, he was always happy to answer any questions I had about the area. He always made sure I was enjoying my stay, and was happy to talk to me about my experiences in the city. Checking in and out was also an incredibly simple process, which helped me in my ever-changing travel schedule. \n\nI will be sure to try and book his apartment again the next time I come to the city.\n\nTL;DR: Very nice, cozy, simple apartment with a very kind owner and fully functioning bedroom/bathroom. Perfect for a quick stay and for someone who's got a busy travel schedule.\n\n"},{"_id":"101671113","date":{"$date":"2016-09-14T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14215061","reviewer_id":"32304973","reviewer_name":"Andre","comments":"I found it to be a very bare minimal stay but all essentials were there the host was very friendly and the room was clean and comfortable. i enjoyed it will book again"},{"_id":"102905249","date":{"$date":"2016-09-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14215061","reviewer_id":"50499449","reviewer_name":"François","comments":"I had a nice stay !

Astoria is a booming neighborhood with my trip working 12/13 hour days at fashion week his place is a perfect place to come home to because of how quiet it is...I highly recommend staying with him.

Krythia is a really nice lady and we had some great short conversations with her. We felt very welcomed. The only thing we like to mention for the apartment that is located in a really nice area of Sydney, is that you can only reach it by bus (5 stops) - so there is no tram nearby. The last bus we were able to find to the direction of the apartment left the city at 8:30 pm. That was sometimes a little bit early for us and we had to take an uber (which costs around 20AUD). Everything else was really awesome and we can recommend to stay there for sure.

Also, with Kalama Park across the street you can play volleyball, tennis or just watch the sunset from the shoreline night after night. 5 minutes from Wailea and 10 minutes from Makena where the string of beaches continue. 'Secrets' and 'Big Beach', 2 of my favorites, have the softest golden sand. Whale watching, boogie boarding and sunbathing at these 2 beaches are some of the many reasons why people return to Kihei year after year.  The Road to Hana, Twin Falls, The Bamboo Forest, Zip Lining, Whale Watching, Sunset Cruising, Hiking the Lava Fields or just lying by the pool downstairs you will have so many options during your stay.","notes":"Restaurants:  Breakfast- Kihei Cafe and Nalu's  Lunch- Joys(downstairs) and Nalu's are my favorite for lunchtime.

For example, he has three different types of pillows on the bed. Firm, soft and feather. Coffee machine with coffee, cream and sugar. All the beach gear you will need, soft cooler, two beach chairs, several sets of snorkel gear, two boggie boards, umbrella and beach towels. He also has plenty of regular towels and all the shower stuff you will need. In-unit laundry with all the detergents hairdryer, first-aid kit, the list goes on. The place is new remodeled, cozy and clean. The bed is super  comfortable and the chairs on the lanai are perfect for lounging and watching the waves.

It is supper clean and has all what you may need for a daily day stay.  Todd, the host, is very responsive and pleasant pearson.  The ocean view is practically unobstructed (the palms make it spectacular) because the condo is located on the 5th floor.   The building is located on the busy street thus is a bit noisy there, but hey, if you like  to be close to shoppings and restaurants and you are up to for nightly life  that is the place. Just crossing that street and you are in the beach park with a strand. The ocean side is rocky but sandy beaches are very close by.  The cool things are the surf shop just under the balcony and  its  activities.  They are renting surfing and paddling boards;  I took the class and loved it!!! You will see people enjoying surfing and paddling right from the seat on the balcony.

There are too many great things to say about this place. The lanai was our favorite part. We made it a point to wake up early every morning to sit on the lanai, drink coffee, watch the people at the surf school below, and listen to the ocean.

Across the street is a great park and beautiful oceanfront walking path, and he’s also right next to a really fun bar and restaurant area which we stumbled upon our first night. His place was super clean and great quality (nice sheets, nice towels etc) and had free parking, so made for the perfect “home base” for our trip. Kihei was also a convenient spot to stay as it made trips to West and East Maui equally convenient.

The description and photos of the condo were exactly what we got. The location was really central and easy to access. It’s right across the street from a cute little beach, and right below is a tour company that does stand up paddle board and surfing lessons. There’s a full grocery store just a few blocks west, and a fantastic little natural/ health food store (with great sandwiches and such) just to the east. It’s a few blocks from what I was told is the “BARmuda” triangle, which is where a few popular bars are, but not so close that it’s bothersome. The condo has a great little private pool, and Todd provides beach towels and other beach gear in case you didn’t bring any. There is a bit of road noise during the day, since it’s located right off a very popular area, but if you close the sliding door you can’t hear anything. It didn’t bother us a bit, but I know some are more sensitive than others. It’s pretty quiet at night, and you can’t even hear the neighbors. The condo was super clean and Todd was very quick to respond. This was one of the best Airbnb experiences I’ve ever had! I want to also shamelessly plug Bio-Beetles car rentals in Maui. If you’re planning on renting a car there (and you probably are!) check them out. We had a great experience with them, as well, and it saved us a ton of money versus renting from a larger company.  Now I can officially say: MAHALO!"},{"_id":"291966136","date":{"$date":"2018-07-16T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14233139","reviewer_id":"69119052","reviewer_name":"Catrina","comments":"Fantastic host.

This time I wanted more privacy and full amenities of my own place so I could keep groceries on hand and have more space to relax. Todd's condo is perfect for this. From the start, his communication was fast and friendly. Everything was presented up front so there were no surprise charges or misrepresented amenities. The view of the water is outstanding, and the location is perfect for walking to restaurants, the water, gift shops, coffee shops, and a grocery store. Parking behind the building is very easy. The building is very quiet overall. The first morning was kind of noisy thanks to some roosters who were excited to let the neighborhood know it was morning. To remedy this we closed the windows and turned on AC in the living room to keep the place from getting to warm overnight (we stayed during a very warm week in early Sept so this was nice for a couple of reasons), and there were no other noise issues for the remainder of our stay. Overall this was a great place to stay and I'll stay here again in the future if it's available."},{"_id":"321212441","date":{"$date":"2018-09-09T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14233139","reviewer_id":"68750604","reviewer_name":"Bryce","comments":"Great location with many eating options in easy walking distance, inside of apartment is super nice and clean.

We loved our stay here. While it's interior design is spectacular, it is also comfortable, which is a hard combination to find. The view and the lanai cannot be beaten, it's the best place for your early morning coffee and late night glass of wine.\n\nThe kitchen is fully stocked with everything you need to cook, great prep space, deep farm style sink, and full of little amenities that Todd graciously has provided. Washer, Dryer, and Dishwasher work great and we were thankful to wash our clothes since it meant we could pack less. \n\nBesides being gorgeous, the shower in the bathroom is awesome.  We loved the peppermint body wash which felt amazing after a day in the sun. So cooling!\n\nPlenty of storage in the bedroom with hangers provided. The bed is very comfortable and I have spinal cord damage so when I say it's (Website hidden by Airbnb) is comfy. The couch is also comfortable, good for a nap after a long day at the beach and my husband loved the armchair.\n\nJoy's Place downstairs became our favorite go-to spot for breakfast or lunch. You can also walk to the local grocery store, it's that close. This is the perfect location for a home base, right in the middle of it all. Easy drive to the other popular locations on the island like Paia, Wailea, and Lahaina.\n\nStop debating and book this place!"},{"_id":"342521867","date":{"$date":"2018-10-28T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14233139","reviewer_id":"31477654","reviewer_name":"Nancy","comments":"All the other reviews have captured our thoughts about Todd's place.

I have observed that many hosts claim an ocean view from the balcony, then post a photo that is zoomed in on a patch of water, giving the impression it's a clear view, when in reality there are trees, utility poles, buildings, etc that take up the bulk of the view.

It was super clean, I especially liked the  huge shower as I’m 6’2 and usually showers are too small for me. If you’re looking for a place to stay in Maui, I’d 100% recommend Todd’s.

The view from the balcony is just like the photo, and lovely to sit on for breakfast and a drink at night. The hot tub and pool were nice, never crowded, plenty of chairs and lounges, even two covered gazebos, and the grounds pretty and well maintained. The outside bar looked nice though we never used it, and the small central lobby was attractive and getting the parking sticker from the receptionist was no difficulty. All was very clean and not one bug did we see even with the screen door open constantly. The temperature and ocean breeze were so perfect we never needed the fan or air conditioner (winter season—December). We loved sleeping to the sound of crashing waves! Garbage and recycling is convenient—at the foot of the stairs. The unit is on the third floor but that’s no problem for anyone in normal health.  A basic kitchen with coffee pot, fridge, utensils, mugs, glasses, knives, microwave.. was all we needed, though there is an electric fry pan and barbecue grills on the property near the pool. Mostly it was quiet and serene, though the crowing roosters get annoying. However, they’re all over Kauai! The condo complex is right on a beautiful ocean beach and we happily swam there, though some advise not to because of the possible current. We stayed close to shore and felt safe. There are many stores and great restaurants really close by, and Kapaa is an excellent central location to tour all of Kauai.  The complex itself has a dinner grill and breakfast restaurant that was so convenient— a minute from the room. There was also a bar with music that seemed popular with young people and was never loud or annoying. Esther is pleasant and responds immediately and the lockbox worked well. I definitely recommend her place and would certainly stay here again."},{"_id":"223125255","date":{"$date":"2017-12-31T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14234514","reviewer_id":"11410754","reviewer_name":"Aleksey","comments":"We had an absolutely great stay at Esther's condo!

We were a bit surprised by the heavy chloride smell, which didn’t give us the impression that the place was super clean. I myself am usually fine with any type of bed, but this one was rather uncomfortable. \n\nThe biggest issue to us was that the AC stopped working around 9:00pm on our last evening there. It was excessively hot and humid in Kauai at that time, so that made the place really uncomfortable for us (and we live on Oahu, so are used to the heat). I was told by the owner that it was not possible to send someone before the morning (which is understandable, but still we were the ones who had to deal with the heat). I spent about an hour looking through the instruction manual online, did a manual reset, changed the batteries of the remote, but nothing worked. We decided to leave and book a hotel in Poipu for the night.\n\nI wouldn’t make a big case out of this if I didn’t get a text the following morning by the owner claiming that she sent someone to the unit and the AC was working perfectly fine. It might be the case, I don’t know, electronic apparels sometimes stop working and then work again for no reason, but I felt like I was accused of being dishonest.\n\nI don’t mean to be obnoxious, but I have a Ph.D. in mathematics and am a university professor, so I believe I would have managed to make the AC work in an hour of trying if there was something that could be done."},{"_id":"306623955","date":{"$date":"2018-08-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14234514","reviewer_id":"190508387","reviewer_name":"Günter","comments":"Wir hatten eine wunderbare Woche in der Wohnung von Esther.

They gave us great recommendations about places to eat and get coffee and always went out of their way to help us. Upon check out, my boyfriend and I had a few hours before we could move into our new place and Carlota and Jessica graciously let us keep our things (including some very large suitcases and a bike box) in their living room. They truly presented themselves as friends which was such a wonderful way to enter into a new city. They even offered us deliciously cold beer, which we eagerly accepted, after check out as we waited in the heat for our cab. They did everything perfectly and I would 100% recommend this place to anyone and will probably stop by to say hello if I'm ever in the area. 10/10 and thank you guys so much for everything!

Wir waren 5 Personen aber die Bettwäsche und Handtücher wurden trotzdem für 10 Leute bereitgestellt.  Die Betten sind bisschen hart, wir haben dann die übrigen Decken benutzt als zusätzliche Unterlage.  Die Zimmern von der Straßenseite sind laut, auch nachts, man hört die Autos hoch und runterfahren auf dem Pflaster. Eine Kaffeemaschine haben wir vermisst in der Küche, aber das ist vermutlich nur bei den Deutschen Touristen wichtig :). Der Consierge war sehr hilfsbereit, reagierte sofort auf die Anfragen, ein dickes Dankeschön an ihn für die Nützlichen Tipps für die Ausflüge! Ein Tipp für die Reisenden: nützt die Zimmern die in den Hinterhof gehen, da hört man die Autos nicht, nur ab und zu den Hund von dem Nachbarn oder das Geschrei der Möwen. \nNetflix ist auch verfügbar wenn man einen Account hat."},{"_id":"310367732","date":{"$date":"2018-08-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14234741","reviewer_id":"69287021","reviewer_name":"Maria","comments":"Great location.

It's right in the heart of Chelsea, a really short walk to restaurants, delis, bodegas, bars, the train... literally everything you need is no more than a 5 min. walk away. And you can see the Empire State Building from your window!\n\nAs far as the room, it's New York-sized and has everything you need for your stay. I was here for a week on business and found it absolutely perfect for everything I was looking for. Bed very comfortable, desk nice and big to spread out, large refrigerator, comfy chairs, etc. \n\nMirek met me right on time for check-in and was so friendly and kind. He even stuck around to answer my many questions and by the end, felt like an old friend. Karen was great, as well: She checked in a few times before my travel day, once I was settled and just before checkout, to make sure I didn't need anything. My emails were answered lightning-fast and Karen was so nice!\n\nAs far as the surroundings, I'm 35 and a single female, and never once did I feel the slightest bit awkward walking around, whether it was 3 pm or 3 am. Chelsea is a fantastic, friendly and clean place, long one of my favorites. \n\nCouple things to remember: This IS New York, so even though you're on the fourth floor, you will hear the traffic (fire engines, construction, passersby) from your window. I left my window open to embrace all the neat sounds, but if you need complete silence during your stay... well, New York isn't the place for you in the first place!\n\nThere is no TV here. Karen *does* mention it very clearly in her description, but I thought I should throw it out there again. \n\nI travel here fairly often for business and I've yet to find a more affordable, clean, beautiful apartment that's so close to everything and close to work at the same time. Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a genuine New York-Chelsea experience. You will NOT be disappointed!"},{"_id":"149912312","date":{"$date":"2017-05-06T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14236416","reviewer_id":"32100624","reviewer_name":"Annie","comments":"This studio was amazing.

The building has an elevator, although I used the stairs.\n\nClose to Chelsea Market, the High Line, and many, many great Chelsea and West Village spots.\n\nThe place is really small, as advertised... but OK for solo/couple who do not plan on staying in for long stretches (no TV  as well) - but that's not something I wanted. Its a bit of walk to the subways - but not a problem for those in good health and lots to see along the way."},{"_id":"196012495","date":{"$date":"2017-09-21T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14236416","reviewer_id":"146182574","reviewer_name":"Steve","comments":"Wonderful, cozy quarters on a quiet street in a great neighborhood.

When we arrived to check in, the Wyndham in Princeville had no idea who I was or where my reservation was; they were not able to find me in their system. When I called you for help there was NO response. The emergency numbers provided went to voicemails that weren't set up. For all I knew I was scammed. I was forced to book a hotel at the last minute that took me way over my budget, forcing me to dip into other areas of my trip and cut from other areas. Hotels were all full on the island while we were here so we couldn't be picky and ended up having to book somewhere on a totally different part of the island making several plans very difficult. This was all due to someone's very serious error to not adequately communicate with the Wyndham to get proper names on file even though ResortShare reached out during the booking process to ensure they had the right names on file. \n\nPrinceville looked very beautiful. I wish that we were able to stay there as planned. When we come back to Kauai, we will be staying in that part of the island because it can't be beat. However, I will never book through ResortShare at this location or anywhere else in the world because of their lack of organization, communication at check in, as well as professionalism. \n\nSave the headache and take your money somewhere else! \n\nTip** While talking with the concierge at the Wyndham after they couldn't check us in, she mentioned AirBNB is fairly new on the island and many sites and agencies are struggling with it. You might be better off booking directly through hotels or resorts. We ended up booking at a Hilton Garden Inn on the island and got tons of amenities like free drinks and beach equipment and other things that we wouldn't have gotten staying in this timeshare. Might be bit more money up front but it evens out in the long run. \n\nHope this helps!"},{"_id":"173747525","date":{"$date":"2017-07-23T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14246971","reviewer_id":"20647603","reviewer_name":"Caroline","comments":"the staff were friendly and fantastic. thank you"},{"_id":"177766078","date":{"$date":"2017-08-03T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14246971","reviewer_id":"65928541","reviewer_name":"Florian","comments":"This is an absolutely great apartment to stay at the north shore of Kauai.

The views are stunning and the resort is great. The check-in was smooth, the room clean. The small kitchen unit would make it extremely difficult to cook, but possible if you plan to only use the microwave or the community BBQ.  The fridge had an ice maker, which was AWESOME! We also had a big corner tub, and I loved that!! \n\nThe reason I chose to downgrade the star rating....  fellow travelers just BE AWARE: It’s a timeshare, so there is no maid service during your stay. They will give you a presentation if you’d like, but we did not, and we didn’t feel pressured. We stayed for 10 days and so we requested new linens, but the resort won’t put them on the bed, only deliver them. The bed was so firm I hurt everywhere after the first night. I ended up sleeping on pillows the whole time.  The bed was an big issue for me, because no one wants to sleep like crap on vacation. There is also no place for baggage in the small lockout room we were in. No closet for hanging items. The table and chairs ended up being a mess of suitcases, shoes and clothes."},{"_id":"409429163","date":{"$date":"2019-02-07T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14246971","reviewer_id":"13969818","reviewer_name":"Leah","comments":"Great place to stay in Princeville.

Comfortable accommodation with everything you need. We did request to move rooms (wanted a higher floor for the balcony) and they obliged. Each room is slightly different one had a/c!

Location is close to Hanalei town, but not much else up that way due to road closures. \n\nCons- Golf course separates you from the ocean which you can’t access, parking for any nearby beaches is practically non existent in princeville and a really long walk. Location of condo is noisy, not for light sleepers- near trash, balcony looks out to trash, parking lot and clubhouse. And the unit runs a little hot (and this was winter) and has no AC only ceiling fan (which was warned ahead of time in description so no complaints just something to consider)."}]}
