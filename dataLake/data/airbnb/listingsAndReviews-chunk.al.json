We were surprised upon check in that a picture of our passport was needed which is very unusual to US traveller (however may be the norm in some European counties). I think an explanation of this would be helpful to guests prior to arrival. Also because travelers usually book months in advance it would be helpful if the host  reminded guests when they request a late check in that a fee will be applied for this, as well as, additional fees for city taxes (none of our fellow airbnb friends experienced this in Barcelona under other bookings). The only other thing I would suggest is additional towels (only 2 provided) and a new storage location for the extra bed linens as they smelled of mildew.

We were arriving into the city early so asked to drop the bags at 12:30pm so we could explore and check in as normal at 3pm which seemed to be lost in translation. Our plans changed and I sent a message to advise that we wouldn’t drop the bags and would check in everything at 3pm. However the lady checking in, Jennifer, thought we were checking in at 12.30pm and wouldn’t be able to return to the flat at 3pm as she had other check ins to do (we were not aware she would be doing check ins at other locations). No solution was offered so we spent the afternoon trying to get hold of her to arrange to get the keys so we could check ourselves in. She eventually managed to accommodate us and returned to the flat. Not an ideal start.\n\nThe flat was clean apart from finding a fake eyelash in the bedsheets as well as lipstick marks. Very limited natural light and the walls are rather thin - neighbours making noise at 2am on 2 nights of our 4 night stay.

Nice small apartment and very well located. It’s very close to Sagrada Familia and to the most main places that you would basically visit there.

We were pretty excited with the idea of spending those nights in Barcelona, but it’s also true that we left a bit disappointing because of the details that we founded. Mostly the cleanliness: we found old coffee in the coffee maker, dishes weren't clean, and sheets and pillows had yellow stains. There was nowhere to put the towels in the bathroom and not enough toilet paper. Also I would consider having a second set of keys, because if someone wants to stay in the apartment the people inside can't get out if the middle door is being locked.\nIn the other hand the communication with M. del Mar was perfect.

Many of the other \"must see\" sites are a bit further out, but we walked and were fine. Metro stations are plentiful near the apt. as well. It is a ground floor apt, very small. For 2 of is it was perfect, but 4 might be a stretch. Any \"issues\" such as they were, would be very minor: more lighting would be great; hooks to hang bath towels; a few more condiments in the kitchen. But again, these are so minor. All in all, I would say the value matches the price for this apt.

The house cat, Shala, is sweet, friendly, and chatty. Though she does have a somewhat annoying habit of jumping onto tables in the morning and pushing things onto the ground to wake you up to feed her.

Linda let me stay the first night at Hale O'Kakuis because the cottage was booked that night. I spent the rest of the time at Kuulai Hale. Here is my review:\r\nLinda: super nice! very open, communicates, actually cares! I felt more than welcome my entire stay.\r\nHale O'Kakuis: Very unique place. Its a farm house that was converted into a beautiful house in the middle of the rain forest. Very comfortable bed, cool shower, full kitchen. Note: this is not a four seasons resort, this is a unique, fun way to experience hilo!\r\nKuulai Hale: First, the driveway up is so pretty, lined by lush grass and clearly very cared for blooming flowers. The cottage is amazing. Very well done. Has everything you need plus some! Including direct TV, laundry, and fans. Very comfy, totally felt at home. Everything was incredibly clean. I would highly recommend all of her locations.\r\nI loved it so much I wanted to just stay and rent it long term! Sadly, I can't stay on the big island forever, but if I would, this place would be amazing.\r\nStay here and you will love it.

Only negative I could throw out is that it can be pretty noisy at night with the bar below, but unless you stay at a mega overpriced hotel tower you can’t avoid that."},{"_id":"336055904","date":{"$date":"2018-10-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16030448","reviewer_id":"67582994","reviewer_name":"Collin","comments":"Very convenient location for Waikiki at a good price.

However, there was VERY loud construction going on in the apartment directly above that started every morning around 7 am and woke everyone up. The amenities were all wonderful.. however the beds were very hard. So unless you like a very hard mattress it was very uncomfortable. There was an espresso machine and some snacks were a great touch! The location was great in terms of being close to the beach and a lot of stores, etc. However, the street in front is very busy and lacks a quiet neighborhood feel that would've been preferable.

Williamsburg - interesting, colorful, artistic and yet quiet area in Brooklyn, the most vivid place I visit in NYC. Bernardo's house is just 5 minutes from the metro station, from which you are just 1 station from Manhatan. \r\n\r\nSecondly - the house itself. Bernardo and his wife are living in a brand new building, with elevator and doorman, so one feels completely safe to come back at any hour. Your room will be big and spacious, with a lot of light, just as you see on the picture. Can you see the the balcony and the hammock in it next to the room? Well, from this balcony and this hamac you will have a great view of Manhatan, since the building is close to the water :) Ah, and of course...Private bathroom. Can you imagine how great it is? Bernardo and his wife are sharing their on the second floor, where their bedroom is located. Generally, all the apartment is very stylish and very, very clean with such a good energy....\r\n\r\nLast, but certainly not least - the hosts. Bernardo and Andressa. What can I say?

Beautiful building and Condo. The view of Manhattan from the balcony connected to your room is to die for! Big room with your own AC unit. Very comfortable bed with a private bathroom. Bathroom is beautiful. Clean with fresh towels waiting for you. You are a 4 min walk to the L subway and a variety of bars and restaurants. Very SAFE neighborhood at all hours of the day and evening. Couldn't have asked for an easier check in experience. Bernardo and his girlfriend are very busy people and are not around much. When home they usually are upstairs, giving you nice privacy, as your room is on the lower level. My experience was excellent and would recommend to any friend traveling.

The Brooklyn Flea two blocks up and the L train one stop away from Manhattan just 3 blocks away? It was awesome. The private bathroom is really nice with a really nice shower.

So awesome to have that view! \r\n\r\nThe bathroom was very clean, we had opportunities to use the fridge and the living room - very spacious place to relax and chill.

Nur einige Dinge zu wissen:  das Appartement und das Zimmer sind super hellhörig - wenn die beiden sich in der Küche nebenan unterhalten, hört man jedes Wort. Wenn Sie einen Film gucken, guckt man mit. Und: derzeit (und es sieht noch nach ein paar Wochen aus) gibt es Bauarbeiten vor der Haustür - ab ca 7 uhr ist es schlichtweg sehr laut durch Lkw, Kräne etc. außerdem gibt es keine dunklen Vorhänge im Zimmer - nur weiße, es ist also ab morgens hell.

They are very sociable, and often had interesting friends over. Their dog is delightful, gentle and lovely! \nWe borrowed bikes and rode around Brooklyn bike lanes and over Brooklyn Bridge which was great. We also went to see Andressa's  theatre production, which was a real treat. \nThe neighbourhood is exciting, loads of cafes, restaurants, viintage shops and venues - we would have liked to have spent even more time exploring Williamsburg.\nAll round a great experience, and we would definitely recommend Bernado and Andressa's place!"},{"_id":"347045783","date":{"$date":"2018-11-10T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1604488","reviewer_id":"96813553","reviewer_name":"Susana","comments":"Great location in Williamsburg.

So you need to find temporary street parking to go upstairs to get the key, so that you can go back downstairs to enter the parking garage.

You’re basically paying for the location near the train. The area was a bit seedy, and there were a multitude of directions to get the keys and where to park. I thought I was on a treasure hunt which sounds fun but after 5 hours of driving, it’s not. (Website hidden by Airbnb) As for the apartment, it is very small and stuffy. The portable air conditioner was basically a fan since it was over 80 degrees in the city and the bathroom was from the 80’s.  Lastly, the garage was a one way, so there was a lot of maneuvering to get in and out. (Website hidden by Airbnb) The main issue we had was they forgot to give us a key to the building so we had to buzz in every time. When we were leaving my partner got stuck in the lobby and had to wait for a person to let him in. When the company that owns these air bnb’s sent me their automated texts reminding me to check out. I messaged back about the key and they “politely reminded me that they had already mentioned that I could just buzz in until 2 am.” They gave us a list of directions to have us check ourselves in without being greeted, the least they could do is provide us with keys.

It's also only a 15 minute walk to the Waikiki strip which conveniently closes at 11pm so tons to do after if you are done for the days activity. Choi who helps host this place does an amazing job and is readily available for any questions. The place was clean \u0026 bed was comfy! There's also Wifi!  Most importantly there are 5 parking floors for their parking garage and it does get filled up! There a cute coffee shop downstairs and also an amazing family owned Hawaiian/Japanese restaurant with great food! If you are planning to go to North Shore it's about an hour drive but on most days it only took us just under! The drive to beaches like Sandy Beach, Waimanalo and the blowhole and the Lanai look outs are about 1/2 hour drive but the drive is beautiful! Honestly I was so glad with the location of the place!

It was even a shorter walk to the beach than we expected, there’s several casual dining options in the building, and there’s even a small bar and a convenience store. They provided plentyyyy of towels and there’s even a box of beach stuff in the closet like snorkel gear and foldable beach chairs.

Here are the pros and cons of our experience with this rental: Pros: **Beach access within walking distance **Views **Kitchen well stocked with essentials **Clean and tidy **Beach towels provided (had to get them delivered since none were in the unit as expected, but they came quickly) Cons: **Beds are not comfortable **Pillows could use replacing - they are very flat **All closet doors were next to impossible to open ( this would not have been an issue had there been any sort of dresser with drawers in the master or if the dresser in the second room had drawers that opened, but there wasn't and they didn't, so we had to live out of our suitcases for the week) **We were told there were sand toys, but there weren't. There was snorkel gear and a lone bucket, but no sand toys. A bit of a bummer for the kids who wanted to build sand castles. Things you should know before booking: **this unit is NOT beachfront, it is shorefront. During our stay the water was out far enough at low tide that we could walk on the sand to the nearby beach, but at no point were you able to set up a blanket and play in the sand right in front of the unit. **pictures of the listing are \"doctored up\" for lack of a better term. All the decor is the same and it's definitely the same unit, but you can tell once you walk in that the images were softened and brightened to add listing appeal. Case in point - I showed my 11 year old the pictures of the listed before we took our trip and upon arrival his first words were \"this looks nothing like the photos.\" **that being said, our boys LOVED waking up in the morning when the tide was out and going exploring in the exposed reefs for fish and sea creatures - this is the most redeeming quality of this unit. We did this most mornings as they never tired of exploring, and one morning we even had a few Humuhumu fish shimming right around us when the water was only up to our knees. Very cool. **owner requires a $500 safety deposit that was not explained in the listing at the time we booked, we received a contract after the fact requesting this deposit and the taxes (also not made clear) so you think you're paying one total price, but you will need to pay more **you are not allowed to run the AC in the unit at night and leaving windows open to utilize cool air crosswinds is not an option as the birds outside the bedroom windows provide you with a 5am wake up call **we were checked out for 10 days with no sign of our security deposit being returned.

You simply cannot beat the location!  Do not believe the other guest review... nothing was doctored up, the furniture was great, we used the AC whenever we wanted to.  There were plenty of sand toys, snorkel gear, etc.  There were no issues.  \n\nMy sister and I were on a quest to see as many turtles on Maui as possible and we saw more than 5 everyday right in front of the condo!  They come and feed on the reef between the hours of 10 am and 3 pm.  Much better than having to drag all of your stuff to the beach and then back.  My husband would be sitting outside on the patio enjoying his coffee and cigar, signal that there was a turtle, and we literally threw on our bathing suits, grabbed the snorkel gear and were in the water in a matter of seconds!  \n\nA total of 4 adults stayed at the condo for over a week and it was cozy but very comfortable.  The kitchen had everything that we needed.  We cooked breakfast, cut fruit from the farmers market, made smoothies; every kitchen tool we needed was there for us.  The beds were comfortable, there were curtains that we could shut to let some breeze in but still have privacy.  The newly done wood-like tile floors were a plus also.  \n\nWe had looked at many condos in this area and in the Kihei area and we are so glad we chose this one.

We had 5 guests staying for 7 days. There are 2 bedrooms, 1 with 2 single beds and 1 with a queen size bed and a pull out couch in the living room. The 2 single beds and the pull out couch were in bad shape. Both of the single beds were completely sloped (over used perhaps) and the pull out bed was completely sunken-in, and very very uncomfortable. Aside from the beds, the location and resort was great. The pool was nice and quiet, there is a great view facing the water by the kitchen and it was decently clean. A few notes for potential guests - we did notice a lot of dust on the bedside tables and some dirty qtips on the floor in one of the bedrooms, but we did a few vacuum and sweeps on our own over the week. Also an FYI - there was also not enough toilet paper for the week, so you'll have to get your own.

The home is equipped with everything needed for beach/fun (snorkels, massive amounts of towels, play equipment, boogie boards, inflatables, even a couple pairs of water shoes) Unfortunately, because of construction and large waves forming sinkholes, there was a very obstructed view of the ocean due to a temporary fence/cones, plus construction workers walking back \u0026 forth across the patio area. This meant the patio area was not as private and not as usable due to the fencing.  Francesco was accommodating in partially refunding us and has been very quick to respond to any issues we had.\n\nNote as other reviewers have said, this property is shorefront/oceanfront not beachfront, which means if you stay during a time when there are large waves, you won’t be able to walk out of the patio area and jump in the ocean since there are lots of large rocks lining the shorefront and very little sand/beach space. There’s a beach only 1 block away perfect for kids since it has a natural wading pool with rocks blocking the waves.  This however is not good for swimming and adults will need water shoes to get over the rock barrier."},{"_id":"264811151","date":{"$date":"2018-05-14T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16078811","reviewer_id":"175750558","reviewer_name":"Vy","comments":"We had an amazing time.

But if you don't want to cook, there are food trucks and a little strip mall with take out places at the end of the drive.

The location of this condo is fabulous. It was right in the center of where we wanted to go. We especially enjoyed seeing whales from the lanai (bring good binoculars) and the beach walk is just a short distance away. We did the 4 mile round trip to the black rocks multiple times this week. The condo was a comfortable fit for the four of us and the kitchen was well stocked. We did not use any of the snorkel equipment on hand so I can’t comment on that. The weather this week was wonky, so we were glad for the extra blankets and quilts Francesco provided.  It’s a very functional condo in a great location. Parking is a tight fit (we had an SUV) but worked. Noise level wasn’t too bad from the neighboring condos. Very walkable to some decent restaurants and coffee shops. Communication was great, although we really didn’t need anything during our stay. Checkout was easy. The notes that Francesco provided us before we came on where to go and places to see were fantastic. All in all, it was a great trip!"},{"_id":"417033702","date":{"$date":"2019-02-25T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16078811","reviewer_id":"83950410","reviewer_name":"Brittney","comments":"The condo was great, beautiful view, parking was just steps from the front door!

There's a 24-hour bakery and late night pizza restaurant around the corner too. Banks, pharmacies and supermarkets are all withing a stones throw away.  The bars and restaurants on the strip (passeig del born) are some of the coolest in town and you can get a nice drink for an affordable price.

Smokers are welcome of course but should use the balconies out of respect for others who don't smoke. This includes in the bedrooms too unfortunately. And remember we have nice neighbors above and around the courtyard too, so try not to chat too loudly out there late at night. Also, as with any major hotel, bringing back strangers and random hook-ups is not allowed. It's a security and safety thing, and afterall, this is my our home and we have to live here too. Again, it's mainly out of respect for others with whom you share the same communal spaces.

Easily walkable to any part of the city that you’d like to get to know. It’s in a very hip area that is super close to a very local bar (literally right around the corner and can get quite loud at night if you sleep with the window open — but also quite charming), and amazing little shops where you can find the coolest Barcelona styles. \n\nAs for the actual accommodations, the space is super quaint and very charming. It’s a really great way to feel like you’re truly living in the city of Barcelona! The space of the room is sufficient for 2 people (though I was only 1!), and you have more than enough privacy when you need it. \n\nOverall, would recommend.

It was cool to experience ancient architecture from within, though.\n\nWe were two friends rather than a couple so not being able to have two keys, even after having asked for it, made things trickier. \n\nStill, the two tiny ailments don't overshadow how well located this is, and AJ is a great host of a unique home.

The area, in my opinion, is a little less touristy than other areas of the city we saw. Lots of great tapas bars and cafes. Even with our poor Spanish, everyone in the area was so friendly and welcoming. \nThe flat itself is quite spacious with a lot of Spanish charm. We had plenty of space in our bedroom to unpack our suitcases and settle in. The bathrooms are very nice and clean. They also look like they've been recently updated.

There is a bike rental for tourists nearby (Rabbit Bike Born) in case you get tired of walking around town and destinations are far to see = like The Magic Fountain (40 min walk vs. 14 min bike).\n\nCONS: I can’t think of one, but if I had to post one it would be waiting on the other guest to finish up with shower – and that’s stretching it. I could have paid for a private room or loft with and shower for an additional fee elsewhere, but did not feel that was needed.\n\nSam met us to at a café in front of the flat to show us in and explain a few things as far as use of the keys, wifi, kitchen, bathroom, common area, and any other useful information – to include recommended hot spots. The wife and I visited during the first week of October and temperatures were nice, so having the room window open was comfortable for both of us and if needed there was a fan that I used. There are noises echoing thru the narrow streets throughout the night/day (depending on your room) outside of the window from people walking in the streets, kids going to school, dogs barking, luggage being rolled on cobble stone, smell of cigarettes, but I have no complaints as I had no troubles sleeping and feel it is all part of being on vacation in another country and part of living in Spain."},{"_id":"333259560","date":{"$date":"2018-10-07T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16083632","reviewer_id":"96172956","reviewer_name":"Jacob","comments":"Good amount of space in the Private room, clean and in a perfect location for restaurants, bars and exploring the city.

They have a lovely choice of almost everything you’re looking for.\nOn the main street there’s a coffee shop where you can buy coffee- even very early in the morning. That opportunity really made my day!\nThe area was very safe for me. I never felt being in danger - even when walking alone on the street in the evening. In fact, you really have to take care of your belongings. Pickpockets are everywhere. One of them grabbed my friend's backpack and I stood next to her. They are so clever that I did not even notice. However, a pedestrian has warned and the thief ran away. In any case, carefulness is well-advised. Take your belongings in front of your body and maybe put some extra money somewhere else in case a pickpocket could make it!

Sam showed my friend round and left us to it. We didn’t get to meet AJ during our stay but communication was quick if we needed anything.  It feels like an air hostel rather than bnb as others guests were in and out but you can find what you need from notes on the walls. The gothic quarter is arty and unusual and at night it gets noisy, the neighbours above us also had a party (but I don’t think this happens every weekend.) but bring ear plugs just incase. Beds are basic but we slept cozy and well (apart from\nParty night) - we were very comfy. Sam sent us recommendations for places to eat and drink and the flat is more geared up towards doing this as pots, pans, utensils and kitchen equipment are sparse. If you are English - there’s no kettle or toaster but lots of places to eat close by and don’t drink the tap water in Barcelona! We felt safe and and had mostly everything we needed for a good stay."},{"_id":"354771772","date":{"$date":"2018-12-02T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16083632","reviewer_id":"11995242","reviewer_name":"Margarita","comments":"Outstanding location, the hosts are nice.

Min very kindly picked me up from the train and sent me the map on his phone when I managed to get lost a few times in the early days. Great big house, an Edwardian gem sympathetically renovated with a lovely pool. Very kind elderly relatives popping in and out and letting me know in Mandarin that it was about to rain (I had washing on the line.) This area is so great for Asian food. Cheap clothing place run by a Korean lady nearby. A delightful area surrounded by native bushland. A holiday at home and a great insight into the contributions made by enterprising recent arrivals. A chilled out house, no hassles. Such kindness that transcends the language barrier. A great month in the Harbour City at an unbeatable price.

Through a quirk of geography, Star, Sun, Moon and St Francis streets have become an island of tranquility in a congested city. Even as the high-rises encroach, the neighbourhood's dead-end streets, narrow alleyways and leafy squares retain their quietude, a quality complemented by an eclectic range of businesses that see the area's calm as an asset. \"All of this makes the neighbourhood very precious,\" says architect Christopher Law.","notes":"","transit":"Subway.

The location was ideal, between several lively neighborhoods, but tucked back from the main streets so it wasn't noisy at night. Multiple air conditioners helped keep us cool while at the apartment, and windows on three sides allowed for a nice breeze to pass through. Overall, a great place to spend a few days, and an exceptional AirBnB host."},{"_id":"141050700","date":{"$date":"2017-04-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16100663","reviewer_id":"9084439","reviewer_name":"Kevin","comments":"Ignacio is such a gentleman and a caring host.

It was convenient for our adventures all over the city. The apartment is clean and stylish. The space is small but well designed to maximise comfort, style and utility. We especially appreciated the comfortable sofa, dining table, cosy bed, fridge, drawer space, and fast wifi. Communication with hosts was good. I'd stay here again and highly recommend it. \n\nThings to be aware of: \n- It's up a hill then 4 flights of stairs. \n- there is one wash basin shared between the bathroom and kitchen. \n- the shower room contains the toilet so it can be a bit wet to use the toilet (and the frosted glass door doesn't give 100% privacy between the toilet and living room). \n- there are only net curtains so you will likely want to wear sleep masks as it won't be dark.

Note that the shower is located right beside the toilet in the same little room, and the only sink is in the kitchen, which might be odd for some westerners like us, but it's probably  normal for Hong Kong and we got used to it. The sheer bedroom curtains don't block out any city lights; we slept well regardless, but bring an eye mask if you're sensitive to light at night. Overall it was a positive experience and we would stay here again!"},{"_id":"412189725","date":{"$date":"2019-02-15T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16100663","reviewer_id":"70417541","reviewer_name":"宝","comments":"房子在中环这个位置已经算是很不错的了,离商场､吃饭的地方走路大概五分钟,离地铁站大约五分钟步行｡房间在五楼,无电梯｡\n房东超级热情好客,而且对人也很好,很nice的房东,下次再来香港希望有机会能再订到这间房"},{"_id":"413753630","date":{"$date":"2019-02-18T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16100663","reviewer_id":"4387415","reviewer_name":"Sue","comments":"What else can I say that has not been said before. This experience has been slightly different fr my other AirBnB in HK (am here 1-3x a yr). First off, Ignacio met me at Pacific Place and showed me ard the studio. Next up, the water heater works and there was hot water throughout (a few times,  hot water stays for 5min). Lastly, this is only the second place which has a portable heater even though I didn’t need it coz the temps were mild.

Surround by many trendy \u0026 delicious restaurants \u0026 cafes its a great place to base yourself for adventuring around Hong Kong. It’s close to Central station, which means you can get everywhere super fast. The apartment itself is cosy for 2 (yes small but actually feels like I’m in Europe rather than Hong Kong).\nAlthough there is no elevator, the host was kind enough to meet me at the station and help me carry the case up the stairs. Also flexible on arranging time to meet \u0026 provided good notes on how to get there. As a solo traveller I felt safe walking around the area at night. Really enjoyed staying for 4 nights and I would definitely stay here again, was nice to feel like a home away from home."},{"_id":"417365012","date":{"$date":"2019-02-27T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16100663","reviewer_id":"51120293","reviewer_name":"Juliette","comments":"Very nice apartment well located in the center of Hong-Kong. It s near shops, restaurants and the subway which is very convenient. However you should be aware that it is super small meaning you ll have to shower right above the toilets and there is only one sink for both brushing your teeths and doing the dishes. Also, there are no shades in the bedroom so you ll be waken up by the sun quite early. And last thing there are some construction work right in front of the building so it s extremely noisy during the day (as of February 25th they were just making the foundation of the building so it might be a while..). Overall not such a great experience although Ignacio was extremely nice and the apartment is charming ! We just lack the comfort and couldn’t really sleep much !"},{"_id":"422424456","date":{"$date":"2019-03-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16100663","reviewer_id":"102174037","reviewer_name":"Karen","comments":"Central location lots of great places to eat lovely vibe"}]}

Next day she knocked and had 2 beach chairs on her shoulder, not the flimsy ones, the good ones....we thought that was incredible. The place is not the Hyatt, but comfy and clean. Our room was big enough for us,shower and toilet in the room, all was perfect. We could use the kitchen, which we did every morning. Well, what else is there to say? I told her, whenever we visit Maui, we will stay with her.

She is fun to talk to, has good recommendations and is available when needed. Paia is a very interesting and unique village away from the big tourist streams of the island. However, it still offers many restaurants bakeries, shops and nice beaches. The village centre and the beach can be reached within 5-10 min by foot. The house itself has several guestrooms which creates a nice atmosphere and offers the opportunity to meet other travellers.

Our room was spacious and the cross breeze at night cooled everything off and was so refreshing. We stayed with another couple who were in another room in the house and met some other travelers that we ended up spending hours chatting together in the living room.

Great communication before, during, and after our stay. She went above and beyond to make sure our stay was perfect. \r\n\r\nOur room (the Hina room) was right off of the main living room area, but even with people using the TV in the living room it was always quiet. One thing that wasn't a big deal to us, but might be to others... there's no door to the bathroom area from the room. Like I said, it didn't bother us, but just know that in case that's not something you're okay with. We had our own parking stall, which was really nice. The room had plenty of towels, beach towels and other beach extras were available for our use (snorkels, chairs, coolers, etc).\r\n\r\nPaia is a great location - we loved the little town and it's distance to both Hana and the more resort-y west side. If you're looking for a quiet getaway in Maui that feels more like home than a hotel, this is the place!

Our room was the one closest to the living room which is spacious and has its own bathroom. The only minor thing I would say about this place is that the heat of the island can concentrate in the room. But this wasn't a big problem since we just opened the windows and door to air it out when we got to the house. Overall it was a very nice comfortable place to stay. Just a tip.. don't be shy to use the kitchen, It took us a couple of days to get comfortable with a shared kitchen and our wallets suffered for it! This is a great place to stay if you're in Maui.

The place has 4 bedrooms in total, and enjoyed chatting with other fellow travelers at the kitchen as well. Enjoyed my stay at hers just like last time. Highly recommend!

The room was exactly what I needed - bathroom in the room (a huge perk when you're traveling by yourself), space for luggage, super comfy bed and strong wifi (I like to netflix before bed!).  The house had all the amenities one could need from an extra beach towel, chairs and floats to a full shared kitchen and living room, if wanted.  The location is really what makes it so great - less than a 10 minute walk to town and local beaches and a quick ride to everything else, airport included.  I highly recommend Rina's house - not only for all of the above, but also her amazing pre-stay communication which included where to go and what to do.  For a first timer, she really put me at ease and gave me everything I needed to plan a great visit. THANK YOU RINA!!

We had intended to make dinner in the shared kitchen and then go into town for dessert, but the common rooms and our bedroom were so unbearably hot, that we felt we had to leave. The town is actually a cute tourist place with lots of shops and restaurants, and we enjoyed the evening. By the time we came home, it was less hot so we were able to sleep even though we prefer a firmer bed. Many people left notes in a book and on the kitchen bulletin board about how much they enjoyed interacting with the host and other guests, but we did not see anyone including the host. The place was clean but had no pictures or other interesting features to brighten it without the energy of other guests. Maybe people who enjoy youth hostels would most enjoy this location."},{"_id":"332645192","date":{"$date":"2018-10-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1613843","reviewer_id":"181958392","reviewer_name":"Daniel And Julia","comments":"Rina is a very kind person.

Rina’s place is located in a  local neighborhood, so you get a feel for the actual everyday Hawaiian lifestyle. There is a was a washer and dryer available at the base of the stairs and certainly everything we needed for our one night stay. The bed was comfortable and the bedroom was big and roomy.

The apartment was clean, the room even nicer than on the pictures, not to mention the flowers Cesar and Nadia left in the living room to make us feel even cosier and it was a nice touch to be greeted with a bottle of vine. Since the NY weather was moody I was very happy the room was so warm, the kitchen had everything we needed, the bathroom was super clean. Best of all things was the fact taht Cesar and Nadia are super responsive and super warm, always there to help but never to intrude, we basically only met here and there since we were out most of the time and they were at work so we felt we had the whole apartment to ourselves.

The renovations are really impressive - gorgeous stone walls, lovely woodwork, all perfectly clean and new looking. The beds were comfortable and the three of us (my two sisters and I) slept well there. It was great having three separate bedrooms, and two bathrooms. Really you could sleep about 8 people there if you wanted to, with the fold out couch on the second floor and the trundle bed in the upper room. We didn't cook there (the restaurant food is so good in Porto!) so I can't comment on the function of those facilities, but the kitchen is lovely to be in. The location is perfect - away from the noise of the river but easy walking distance. One warning - if you have a car, you need to figure out some sort of arrangement for parking. You pay 2 Euros per 2 hours to park on the street between 8 and 6, and you can't buy several hours at once. We got a 12 Euro ticket, but it actually seemed like a good deal for a day's worth of parking. Now we just have to figure out how to pay it!

The stairs are a bit precarious - especially if you need to get up in the night.\nIt is a steep climb up a very rugged lane to get to the door, so if you have large cases take note of a previous reviewer’s tip, and take the escalator to the top floor in the adjacent shopping mall and exit through the side door.

A Fort Tryon park with the great views of the river and bridge, and beautiful and solemn Palisades across (view of New Jersey), a beautiful garden, anytime od the year, is a great spot for photography.

And there was also a big oily spot in the middle of the bottom sheet. I was disgusting. But I suppose she don't care at all because she already has the money. And the toilet seat was grubby. At least the bedroom was good heated and the best thing about the apartment is Mr. Green. The sweetest and cutest cat I've ever seen.\n\nMás ruidoso de lo esperado, incluso con tapones era difícil dormirse. LAs sábanas estaban sucias, llenas de pelos de humanos de distinto tamaño y grosor y con una mancha aceitosa en la mitad de la bajera, a la altura de la cadera. Asqueroso. La tapa del váter estaba mugrienta, si le pasabas un papel, éste salía negro.

Fei and his wife make sure that you have everything you need. They often checked on our family, got us fruit and milk on our first days. Fei's wife is a lovely and caring women who was really helpful. The place is totally valuable! I would suggest this to anyone who'd like to stay in a quirky, classic style.

You could eat breakfast close by or go to the disco or burlesque show in the area. The appartment was very clean, the bed was comfy and there was a washing maschine with a dryer to use. The host was friendly and gave good tips where to eat or shop. Main minus was that the living room area was in the basement so it was a bit humid. It got noisy at the street at night, so you could not leave the windows opened at night. But when the windows were shut it was very quiet. The bathroom was tiny so my husband had some problems fitting his legs inside. :) \nIt is perfect for couples or a few close friends!

Overall we had a pleasant stay. There was not much problem for us during our stay other than during the day we arrive. We had to really find our way there. Maybe the directions provided to the air bnb can be a little clearer (with photos) especially for travelers of different language and/or without data. \n\nThe location is good, still consider walkable to many main attractions and areas. \n\nUnit is located on the ground floor but is generally quiet unless the night before a public holiday, it can get a little noisy until 4-5am in the morning. \n\nThe toilet is clean but small. Not enough space to do what a lady needs to do (no space to hang clothes after hanging the towels, no space to put necessary toiletries etc unless on the floor). So have to do take it to the bedroom above. \n\nThere's an overall of 4 separate spaces in 3 different levels in this air bnb. It is an interesting unit with these different spaces and unique homely design but It may sometimes get a little inconvenient especially during cold weather. To get to the toilet from the bedroom we have to climb down and up a few winter cold metal stairs (so close yet so far). \n\nThere is no pocket wifi provided and the LAN wifi may be unstable at times so travelers may consider getting your own data."},{"_id":"234319702","date":{"$date":"2018-02-12T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16182647","reviewer_id":"36659584","reviewer_name":"Gregory","comments":"Book this place as soon as possible. \nVery beautiful place. \nClose to everything. \n"},{"_id":"239306665","date":{"$date":"2018-03-01T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16182647","reviewer_id":"20324994","reviewer_name":"Shanks","comments":"Great location quirky lil apartment, great host."},{"_id":"253366695","date":{"$date":"2018-04-14T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16182647","reviewer_id":"174436815","reviewer_name":"Manuel","comments":"Very good!"},{"_id":"258972914","date":{"$date":"2018-04-30T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16182647","reviewer_id":"135325756","reviewer_name":"Jared","comments":"This is a really cool studio that is perfect for couples.

Literally a stone throw away from the city center, yet still feels \"not touristy\". Basically felt like a couple of locals living in Barcelona (for a week). I would however caution not to leave the door unlocked even when you're on the inside, and don't leave things to dry outside. Other than that, the neighborhood felt really safe and welcoming. Around the apartment you can find loads of coffee shops, restaurants, bars and a nightclub. A lot of previous guests mentioned the noise outside, but if spend the whole day exploring Barcelona and even go out at night, nothing could disturb your sleep. In short, I'd highly recommend this place to any young couple traveling to Barcelona.

It is a city with a lot of history, and we were grateful to be able to experience it. Simona's place served us well for our 2 night stay in Barcelona. Although it did require a 10 minute cab ride each time to get to the main areas of the city (Gothic Quarter, etc.), the apartment is in a safe well-lit area frequented by many people. It wasn't noisy from the street in our opinion, and the apartment felt very secure. The bed was by far the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on in an AirBnb (probably more comfortable than my own bed at home). The wi-fi, water pressure, and cleanliness were all great as well. Simona was very easy to communicate with and accommodated our late check-in due to our flight being delayed. The bathroom is a bit smaller than we expected, but it was fine for the couple of days we were there. The main thing that threw us off upon check-in was the city tax Simona's assistant collected from us in Euro. We were surprised by this, but in defense of the host, the tax is listed in the additional info section of the House Rules. We just felt that it should be more front and center of the listing. We paid it of course. We also weren't told where the bed linens were but discovered them under the bed along with other supplies the next day.

I was traveling alone from the states and never felt my safety was in jeopardy. The apartment is right on the street but the noise was minimal (only as a car passed by every so often) and did not prevent me from sleeping extremely well."},{"_id":"338383429","date":{"$date":"2018-10-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16182647","reviewer_id":"5881153","reviewer_name":"Kasmira","comments":"Such a beautiful house!

It is a small space which has really been maximised. It is neat and tidy and has everything needed to make you feel comfortable (Email hidden by Airbnb) munication and flexibility was awesome. Simona was really helpful and accommodating to requests.\nThe apartment is located in a quieter area near some great pincho bars and well located for the metro. It can get quite loud at night (well early morning) due to a club nearby (I think??) but after a long day exploring you can easily sleep right through. Possibly bring ear plugs. \nThe only other slight issue is that the Bathroom is a little small but you don't spend much time in there anyway.\nI recommend Simona's apartment as a great place to stay and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again"},{"_id":"343002140","date":{"$date":"2018-10-30T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16182647","reviewer_id":"13504097","reviewer_name":"Marleny","comments":"Simona was so sweet and accommodating.

The interesting layout of the house made it quite an experience. The only downside was its proximity to a disco around the block. As I'm a light sleeper, I read through all of the reviews and checked that others have thought that the noise was to its minimum when the windows were shut. This wasn't the case for us as it was Christmas when we visited and people were partying all throughout the week from 2 to 6 am. Thankfully, Simona was a great host and helped us change the reservation to check out early to move to a hotel. She apologized for the noise, and I let her know that it wasn't her fault. Simona also recommended other parts of Barcelona where it's more suburban and quiet, which was very nice of her. If you are looking to party and really walk around the town, this is the place you should go for. If you are looking for a relaxing getaway, be aware that there are going to be some noises on the weekends at night."},{"_id":"364136522","date":{"$date":"2018-12-30T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16182647","reviewer_id":"181396496","reviewer_name":"Barbara","comments":"Awesome space, safe interesting neighborhood.

Would like to list the pros and cons of a this place. The place was good but I feel its not worth the money. This property is listed under Airbnb plus and hence is a little overpriced. But this was our 3rd Airbnb stay is Spain and i feel there was nothing special to be listed under an Airbnb property.\n\nPros :\n\nLocation - Very close to one of the main metro stations and bus stop. Just 3-4 mins walk. Also lot of attractions of Barcelona are nearby.\n\nCheckin - Checkin and checkout was smooth.Need to call the host 1-1.5 hrs before arrival or share the details.\n\nComfortable bed - The bed was really comfortable.Had a good sleep during the stay.\n\nEquipment - Well equipped kitchen with all the facilities you will need during your stay.\n\nCons :\n\nLevels : The bedroom is not connected to the toilet directly. Everytime you need to visit the toilet from the bedroom you have to come down to the living room and climb up to the toilet again. This is because the house is built on split levels. The bedroom is placed few steps above the entry door and the living room is few steps below the entry door. The toilet is at the same level as the entry but on the back side.This becomes a little irritating when you are there for a long stay.\n\nToilet size : The toilet is too small. The WC is placed so close to the washbasin that you cant even sit there comfortably. I am 6ft tall and i wasn’t able to sit there without legs hitting the washbasin.\n\nVentilations : The house has poor ventilation since its located on the ground floor. The windows open towards the road so you have to keep it shut.\n\nAC : The AC is located in the bedroom. So wont be effective in the living room below\n\nTV :  Would have been nicer if there was a Netflix connection. We had the same in Madrid and was quite useful when at home\n\nOverall i feel the place is not worth the money they charge. You can find a property which is not Airbnb plus and save some money."},{"_id":"400522408","date":{"$date":"2019-01-12T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16182647","reviewer_id":"28345872","reviewer_name":"Gerard","comments":"Good place in a great location.

The room has its own desk and chair, which allows for computer use in the room. The kitchen is very small, and I found that the utensils variety and number did not allow for regular meal preparation...keeping in mind this is a share house so other people are also using the facilities. There is no dishwasher so dishes are done by hand. The washing machine is fully functional and easy to use. The common TV looses coverage often...due to the weather and the location of the house.

Co je důležité, pan Ciprian vás nikdy nenechá v nouzi. I kdyby se vám posunul let, nebo jiná nepříjemnost, je zřejmé, že hostitel za své hosty cítí zodpovědnost a je vždy připraven jim pomoci. To se mi hrozně líbilo. Dům se nachází 5 minut od metra stanice a v pěkné a bezpečné řásti Bronxu. 15 minut pěšky je ZOO Bronx a botanická zahrada. Všude kolem domu jsou supermarkety a ostatní obchody, kde nakoupíte vše, co potřebujete. Ve druhém patře je balkon, kde můžete kouřit. V domě jsou ubytováni převážně studenti, turisté, ale vždy se jedná o slušné lidi. V domě jsou celkem 4 koupelny k dispozici. V případě půjčení auta je kolem domu několik hlídaných parkovišt. Na den se platí za parkoviště auta 10 dolarů. Na Manhattan to trvá metrem 20 minut.Pokud pojedu znovu do New Yorku, rozhodně chci ubytování u pana Cipriana zde. V poměru cena/výkon nenaleznete výhodnější nabídku. Děkujeme rodině Cipriana za klidnou dovolenou.

His place is also near the freeways so if you are driving, you can easily get around.\r\n\r\nHost: Chikie was so nice to help me with my bags when I arrived and he also invited me out with some of his friends since I was in the city alone and I had a great time. He was just an overall gentleman and so was his roommate. \r\n\r\nThe room: Just as it looked on the pictures. If you are a light sleeper, you may not like the air conditioner in the window because you hear everything outside. However, it kept the room very cool and I was comfortbale. Didn't bother me though.

Our bus departed late on Sunday night and he allowed us to leave our belongings at his apartment hours past the indicated check out time so that we could continue to enjoy the city.

Il a toujours essayé de répondre au mieux à nos attentes lorsque nous avions besoins de conseils pour notre séjour.\r\n\r\nLa chambre est comme sur les photos, elle est équipée d'un dressing et de deux grands miroirs. Le lit est confortable et parfait pour deux personnes.\r\nC'est la chambre qui est à louer mais tout l'appartement était à notre disposition : salon (équipée d'une TV + home cinéma), cuisine équipée, salle de bain. Chikie, lorsqu'il était chez lui, restait dans sa chambre et se montrait discret.\r\n\r\nLes deux seuls petits bémols :\r\n- La chambre qui ne peut être verrouillée à clé (le verrou est usé et s'ouvre sans trop forcé même lorsque la poignée est bloquée par la clé). Néanmoins, Chikie semble être un hôte responsable et de confiance, il n'est jamais venu ne serait-ce que toquer à la porte pendant le séjour.\r\n- Ma femme a vu un petit cafard dans la cuisine (à deux reprises). L'appartement est pourtant très propre, entretenu et épuré, cela provient surement du voisinage.\r\n\r\nL'appartement est très bien situé, dans le quartier de Harlem, à trois minutes à pied de la station 137th street sur la ligne 1 du métro. On peut se rendre en 15-20 min à Times Square et en 10 min à Central Park. Il y a également un bus juste devant le bâtiment sur Amsterdam avenue.\r\n\r\nLe voisinage est vraiment sympathique, nous n'avons pas eu de sentiment d'insécurité. Ambiance portoricaine au rendez-vous ! Le quartier est très vivant durant la soirée.\r\n\r\nPour conclure, je ne peux que vous recommander de choisir Chikie comme hôte, notamment pour le rapport qualité/prix qu'il propose.

Divertido, amigável, pronto para ajudar a qualquer momento, eu me senti em casa lá. \r\n\r\nO bairro no Harlem fica bem localizado, próximo a duas linhas do mêtro (A/B/C são juntas e 1), sendo que o mais próximo fica a uma distância de uns 100 metros (137 St - Linha 1). Próximo a mercado, lavanderia, restaurantes regionais e parques. \r\n\r\nO apartamento deve apresentar uns 60 m2, o que é considerado grande para NY. Todos os cômodos estavam sempre limpos e organizados. Na minha estadia (última semana do ano de 2015), Chikie recebeu amigos e familiares em seu apartamento, portanto sempre havia pessoas por lá e todas prestativas e amigas. Principalmente o amigo George, que todas as vezes perguntava a minha mãe ou a mim como estavámos e como tinha sido o dia em NY, muito simpatico. \r\n\r\nO quarto é privativo e muito aconchegante, o Chikie entrega a chave do quarto para maior privacidade, além do mais ele disponilizou um Ipad para maior comodidade. O quarto tem uma cama de casal, televisão, um armário com gavetas e alguns folhetos com guia de NY. Deve apresentar uns 12 a 16 m2.  \r\n\r\nA próxima viagem a NY tenho a certeza que voltarei ao apartamento do Chikie, ele é um anfitrião perfeito. No último dia me ajudou inclusive com as malas até o mêtro. \r\n\r\nTodos os valores de metragem do apartamento e quarto não são precisos, porém, devem se aproximar da realidade. \r\n\r\nLugar ideal para quem quer se sentir em casa! \r\n\r\nI hope see you soon again Chikie!

We missed having a blanket, and due to never seeing our host, either early in the morning or late at night, we ended up not getting one for our stay.\n\nAlthough it was a long weekend, we were not expecting to have so much noise so late at night, especially from non airbnb guest and on the last day, which made it hard to rest and sleep.\n\nWe unfortunately also had a very unpleasant experience while using the washroom. Found the garbage in the middle of the bathroom, the mop inside the tub, and the tub was full of blood, which I had to clean to be able to use it. It might have been the other people staying in the other room or the overnight guest, not sure who, but the fact is that it was all dirty and seemed that no one took a look at it was somewhat disappointing.\n\nOverall it was an ok experience."},{"_id":"252668494","date":{"$date":"2018-04-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1619695","reviewer_id":"169766274","reviewer_name":"Thiago","comments":"Chikie is a awesome hostess!"},{"_id":"254664812","date":{"$date":"2018-04-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1619695","reviewer_id":"171569916","reviewer_name":"Jérôme","comments":"Chickie est un être exceptionnel formidable avec un cœur énorme et très humain adapté à tout le monde dans la compréhension de chaque profil d’être humain !

D'ailleurs, si ma sœur et moi revenons à New-York, nous reprendrons d'office son logement.\nNous recommandons son logement car il est vraiment bien placé. En effet, il y a deux lignes de métro : la plus proche est la ligne 1 rouge à moins de 5minutes à pied et il y a aussi la ligne AC bleue qui est un peu plus loin mais assez proche. Vous avez donc le choix.\nNous avons rencontré Chikie quelques jours après notre arrivée et ce fut une superbe rencontre car c'est une personne agréable, sympathique, généreuse, attentionnée et drôle. Un soir, nous étions rentrés tôt, alors Chikie nous a fait à manger (pour ma sœur, moi et pour une autre personne provenant de Seatle qui louait aussi le logement de Chikie). Nous avons beaucoup appris sur chacun et nous avons beaucoup ri. C'était une chouette expérience et nous aimerions rencontrer des personnes aussi chouettes que lui chaque jour.\nLe seul inconvénient est que la chambre est assez petite pour des filles car comme nous n'avions pas de clef pour fermer la chambre, nous avions laissé toutes nos affaires dans nos valises et donc c'était difficile de les ouvrir et de les refermer dans la chambre chaque jour. \nA part cela, tout était vraiment bien! :) \u003c3\nWe do like Chikie as our close friend now! You're are welcome in Belgium whenever you want so don't hesitate to call us and have a pint of Belgian beer.

The kitchen was stocked with everything we needed.  Safeway and the Health Food Store is right across the street!  We loved eating our meals on the balcony with the sweet island birds.  The cool Kapaa breezes and the fans that are provided cooled the condo down quickly.   Linda was an amazing host!  She answered my questions quickly, compassionately and always added extra tips!  Her kind heart was a reflection of the Aloha spirit that ripples through the island.  We will for sure come back and stay at Linda and Dean's condo!  Thank you Linda and Dean!!!

The interior is tastefully updated and cozy for two or a couple with a small child. Impressively clean. We even stayed in a couple days to recover from our excursions. While it is close to the main road running around the island, that also makes it an easy and quick walk to numerous great restaurants. I can say that because we tried nearly all of them! The complimentary beach gear made hitting the local beaches very easy and convenient. Just grab it and go. The ocean front lawn of the complex is a lovely spot to watch the sunrise every morning before heading out for the day. Thoughtful touches throughout. This little condo is very well equipped and had two things that were exceptional... a really comfy bed and a GREAT shower.

I asked for information and Leanne responded promptly. She gave us adequate directions to reach the place and check in. The entry to our rooms was through another gate. The room is a few minutes from Victoria Park and Causeway Bay MTR metro station - so location was good.\n\nOur room was within a unit on the first floor. It was as described (it is a guest house) and as per the photos - two beds placed perpendicular to each other. The beds are probably just right for someone about 5'9'' and come with a pillow and blanket. The pillow and bed were a bit hard for our liking. A safety locker is not inside the room, but we did not ask for one either (so we would not know if there was one elsewhere). There is a water cooler with hot/cold water that is shared by 2-3 other similar rooms within this unit. The wifi was sometimes slow, but it is not a major issue.\n\nThe washroom is small but I presume this is due to Hong Kong space shortages. It came with functioning hot/cold water shower. You might want to manage your own soap, etc. Both the washroom and the room were cleaned.\n\nWhile we liked the accessibility and being able to return to a clean room, during our time, the window air conditioner in the room was noisier than most normal ones are. We informed Leanne, and she told us that she would get it looked into later.\n\nChecking out was a breeze too.

They truly made me feel at home while still having my privacy. I felt pampered with the lovely space, the luxurious amenities and beautiful ambiance. It is peaceful, especially gazing out the window last night while it was snowing. Great time for my journaling. The heater can get the room quite toasty and you have the option to turn it off. I enjoyed great rest in this mini paradise. Isabella goes beyond the call of duty in wanting to make her guests feel comfortable. I am very grateful. The listing was described accurately and the room was even better than expected. It is immaculate, cozy and stylish. Isabella really anticipates the needs of her guests--like an international outlet charger. \r\nThe neighborhood bustles with NYC energy.  I hear it's a true NY community. Cool to be away from the routine tourist traps, yet I was still close enough to get my fill. The subway is right outside the apartment--especially neat as it was cold and blustery during my stay. I was in TSquare and WTC in a jippy on the 1 train--a perfect train line that took me everywhere and anywhere. Super convenient to get an int'l data plan from T-Mobile downstairs from the apartment. Isabella recommended great eateries in the immediate area and the really cool Cloisters museum in the Tryon park that is 15 minutes from apartment. I even traveled to Brooklyn to see a friend and the 24hr train system is safe and filled with endless shows by street performers. The A train is close when needed to get to the airports, but I got the 1 train and transferred 1 stop to A to get me to port authority.  I know I wrote a tome, but the family took the time to deliver great care for me and I am very thankful.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, Isabella and her family get people! They get hospitality! They rock! Thank you guys for making my trip fun! And your daughter is such a bundle of joy!"},{"_id":"121872030","date":{"$date":"2016-12-19T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16220849","reviewer_id":"106960408","reviewer_name":"Zhicheng","comments":"Isabella's place is clean and cozy, and the family are very welcoming.

Isabella took it upon herself and upgraded us to the suite without any price hike. Now, that is service! My girlfriend and I were excited and so relieved that we can catch some zzzzz's before exploring this amazing city. The room is serene, super clean and so comfortable.  We loved the bed--we slept like babies. Isabella always anticipated our needs and checked in with us. The room came with beverages, chocolate and gourmet coffee and tea.  We also appreciated the keyless access to the apartment--so modern and cool. We felt like it was our own place and truly enjoyed our privacy. My goodness, how close can the metro station be...I mean only a few steps away to everywhere that matters in Manhattan. We truly enjoyed this uptown neighborhood in Manhattan, as it was raging with NYC energy and excitement. And we roamed all over the city.

The apartment is also close to a bus station, the ferry and train station so getting into the city was very easy. The apartment was cosy with lovely views over the parramatta river. It was also well equipped with everything we needed. \nAs for the negatives, unfortunately there were some cleanliness issues. When we arrived we found some dirty dishes, dirty towels and face washers in the bathroom and the shower was quite dirty. We were concerned that the sheets on the bed had not been changed after the previous guest so we contacted the host who confirmed that they had not been changed so we had to strip the bed, wash all bedding and remake the bed. Thankfully the host did respond to our questions promptly and truthfully and provided info about where to find clean bedding - however when staying in an air BnB I don't think it's too much to ask that the sheets are clean. We had to wait up until about midnight for the bedding to dry before we could go to sleep. \nAll in all, good location, good communication, nice little apartment but a few minor cleanliness issues"},{"_id":"210721245","date":{"$date":"2017-11-10T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16234640","reviewer_id":"61042482","reviewer_name":"Anita","comments":"This is a great spot to stay as a launch into all directions of the greater Sydney area!  \nAll public transport options are available very close by, we took the ferry into the city, it was a really nice trip and if you don't have an Opal card, it's very quick and easy to buy one at the convenience store downstairs.\nThe floor to ceiling windows are pretty amazing and the breeze that comes through at that height was all we needed to keep the apartment at a comfortable temperature. The sunset view is beautiful.\nThe estate has other buildings and common areas being worked on, but it doesn't effect your stay - just great for people watching when you sit at the dining table! :)  There's a convenience store downstairs, there's an IGA about a 2 minute walk away, as well as a coffee place, medical centre, chemist, vet, nail bar and more that looks to open soon!  Then in the other direction, in the same estate, not sure how long it would take to walk (maybe about 5-10 minutes), but there's a few restaurants there.  You could also walk over the pedestrian bridge to a large shopping centre in Rhodes, it has everything you need there!\nThe hosts were lovely, while we didn't need to call on them during our stay, they seem like they'd do anything to try and help make your stay the best possible."},{"_id":"211449348","date":{"$date":"2017-11-12T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16234640","reviewer_id":"136656929","reviewer_name":"Philli","comments":"We LOVED this apartment so so tidy and clean , simplistic and stunning \nThank you so much to great host also was helpful and very quick to answer phone etc"},{"_id":"211886993","date":{"$date":"2017-11-15T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16234640","reviewer_id":"147595172","reviewer_name":"Ryan","comments":"Great location, Great view, Awesome facilities would defiantly stay again!!"},{"_id":"212042144","date":{"$date":"2017-11-15T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16234640","reviewer_id":"144398835","reviewer_name":"Samuel","comments":"We had a great stay, Would definitely come back in the future"},{"_id":"212221118","date":{"$date":"2017-11-16T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16234640","reviewer_id":"78046911","reviewer_name":"Huan Yie","comments":"Overall a pretty good place"},{"_id":"213574468","date":{"$date":"2017-11-22T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16234640","reviewer_id":"132141633","reviewer_name":"Jay","comments":"It was good to stay\nThanks"},{"_id":"213742164","date":{"$date":"2017-11-22T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16234640","reviewer_id":"83096663","reviewer_name":"Kevin","comments":"Great place with a fantastic view.

It was a 22 degrees winters day in Sydney, however when entering the apartment it was stifling hot, even with all windows open. We closed all windows and blinds and put the air con on and it took forever to cool down the apartment as it has floor to ceiling length windows. I would hate to imagine what it would be like on a 35+ degrees day in Sydney's summer. The bed was rock hard and the pillows offered no support, so I would suggest bringing your own pillow. The total cost was $186.56 AUD for a one night stay on a Monday night, when booking more than five months in advance. $65 of this was a cleaning fee, which I find excessive as to have the bins emptied, sheets changed and a quick vacuum would not take very long. There were a couple of convenience stores nearby. We walked over the foot bridge to find somewhere for lunch but both places were closed, so other than one small cafe nearby there was nowhere within walking distance to eat out."},{"_id":"312590162","date":{"$date":"2018-08-23T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16234640","reviewer_id":"12261552","reviewer_name":"Hans Wartono","comments":"Yang's apartment is about 45 minutes by train and bus from central station.

This house is straight out of a magazine. I don't think the photos they have on the site do this place enough justice. When we first walked into the house, I looked at my husband and said, \"I think we just won vacation!\". Although there were only three beds and six of us (my husband, myself, my three grown children and my 77-y/o mother), we managed. It would have been nice to have had different bed options, but, there was plenty of space for us to spread out and do our own thing. There is no air conditioning except for that which Mother Nature provides. It was okay because the house is designed with plenty of cross ventilation. That first nite, it rained. Listening to the rain and the crash of the waves, everyone had the deepest sleep they had had in months. The property was very clean and well-stocked. And, there is laundry onsite. Tina is the onsite manager who lives in back of the house. She was gracious and very nice. She gave us some very helpful insight into the cove (when the tides were coming in and what to expect), the neighborhood, places to go, things to see. I just have to say that when she asked for the cleaning fee and the taxes on our second day, I was a little caught off guard because I had forgotten about that (I had made the reservations in February; we went in July). It would have been great if it could have been included in the total price. Just make sure to bring a check for the taxes and the requested cash for the cleaning fee. The beach is right in our backyard. The only potential problem with that is that it is the only usable beach around that area so a lot of other vacationers swarm the area on the weekend. That made it feel much less personal and private then. There is a very good-sized backyard and a small fence that separates the property from the beach. Unfortunately, no turtles during out stay; but, plenty to see. Your daily view is a beautiful cove with crashing waves and amazing sunsets, sunrises. Lots and lots of pictures and videos were posted on my (Hidden by Airbnb) page. We went to Walmart and bought snorkeling gear and we were out at least a couple of times a day. There were lots of brightly colored fish, sea cucumbers, different types of coral as well as lots and lots of urchins!!! I had thick soled beach shoes and was glad because the water can get very shallow and the bottom is rocky in spots. The urchins are not to be taken lightly. They are spiny and even with our shoes, every single one of us ended up with some urchin spines stuck in a toe or hand. Fortunately, the water is so clear and shallow that you don't necessarily even need snorkel gear to see fish.

Although it is located in a pretty touristy area, it is far enough removed from the shops \u0026 tourist bustle, if that scene isn't for you.  The location is right on the beach, which is incredible.  I certainly enjoyed my morning cup of coffee on the beach, watching the sunrise, and the gorgeous sunsets too!  The small bay outside of the house had sea turtles, oodles of tropical fish, and a sandy entrance that was sheltered \u0026 calm enough that even our 2 year old daughter could enjoy the water.  We climbed the tide pools and lava rocks every day and there was always something new \u0026 interesting to see.  The outdoor area has extremely comfortable fabric loungers, a hammock, reclining lawn chairs, and is SO set up for relaxation \u0026 entertaining.  The grounds are gorgeous \u0026 inviting.  The house itself was sparkling clean \u0026 had a retro charm \u0026 thoughtful minimalist decor that I really appreciated.  It was compact but surprisingly private \u0026 quiet, even for 5 adults and a toddler.  The shoji screens upstairs were an effective buffer to noise when closed, but really cooled the space when open during the day.  Both Cecelia, the property manager, and Lopaka, the groundskeeper, were extremely friendly, welcoming, and readily available to answer any questions- and they both brought us fresh mangoes from the trees on the property which was a memorable touch.  I should mention that if you're looking for a completely private rental, they are constantly on the property- although they are very careful to keep a low profile \u0026 be respectful of the guests.  I can't say much about the surrounding town- the house \u0026 beach were such a relaxing oasis that we really didn't leave (guess that's good, right?), but there were certainly plenty of sights to visit a short drive away.  Although I never met Valerie she was great with communication, answered questions promptly, and provided some excellent recommendations for restaurants \u0026 activities.  All and all this was a wonderful place to stay and I'd recommend it in a heartbeat.

There were many times when we were the only people on the beach or in the lagoon.\nZen Cottage itself is a peek into dreamy, old world Hawaiian plantation living.  Totally open to breezes and the sound of the ocean.\nThe location is also fantastic because of the proximity to all the other shopping, entertainment etc. that can be found in town or further south in other older tiny towns on the way to Kealekekua.\nThe truth is though, we quickly wound down from our hectic mainland lifestyles and discovered we just wanted to enjoy the peace and quiet of the lanai and the spectacular view.  Absolutely perfectly situated for the sunset.\nThe location is lovingly cared for by 2 onsite caretakers.  Both of these lovely folks quickly became pleasant visitors as they went about their daily tasks on the property.  They made us feel cared for without ever intruding on our space or privacy.  Also, we loved having people around we could ask about the best fish market or the local lore.\nWe really can't wait to come back next year!!!"},{"_id":"258851371","date":{"$date":"2018-04-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16242685","reviewer_id":"54396486","reviewer_name":"Beau","comments":"A space that only exists in dreams.  I can say enough how positive my experience was at the zen cottage.  The house is fabulous.  The view unparalleled.  The communication with the owner and staff were so pleasant too.  I have stayed in Airbnb’s all over the world and this is hands down my favorite.  I want to tell the world and also keep it a secret.  It’s an absolute gem and I relaxed on a level that I haven’t in years.  Waking up to the crashing waves and slivers of light bolting through the floor to ceiling open doors is something that can’t be over stated.  It’s breathtaking.  If you’re looking for a peaceful place but close to so many things, this is it.  I will be back."},{"_id":"264816330","date":{"$date":"2018-05-14T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16242685","reviewer_id":"5758814","reviewer_name":"Claire","comments":"We loved the location and old school Hawaiian vibe of the property but we had some major issues that have been discussed with the host. \n\nFirstly, on the second day of our stay the plumbing stopped working and we weren't able to use the showers or toilets.

The host was quick to accomodate us but it was an inconvenience and not the property that we wanted to stay in. \n\nSecondly, read the \"House Rules\" section of the advert in full.

The location was close to everything we needed (the airport, shopping, restaurants) and the backyard beach was a paradise seeker’s dream come true. The lanai was the perfect location to catch the beautiful sunsets each evening. Cecilia the caretaker was helpful yet unobtrusive and Valerie was incredibly easy to communicate to and was quick to respond throughout.

Wonderful living atmosphere inside a beautiful but minimalistic home well taken care of by dutiful grounds keepers.   The waves break far enough out to create just the gentle sounds for sleepy time, which is quite comfortable with great beds and linens.  We stayed in the middle of a very hot and humid summer and the ceiling fans in each room, combined with the roof fan and breezy windows made it quite comfortable.  It is such a privilege to stay in front of the most desirable tide pool beaches in the area.   It is uncomfortable at first with all the visitors to the beach, but once you realize they have to scramble over rocks at low tide for 20 minutes to get to your front yard, it isn't all that bad.  Thank goodness for Cecilia and Lopaka, who keep firm control of who is coming and going, letting us worry about where to take afternoon naps, and not about uninvited guests.   This house is a hidden gem, don't sleep on it, we have it bookmarked.

The cottage is every bit as idyllic as the photographs suggest and we had a wonderful six days there. Valerie is a wonderful host and everything we needed was provided for our stay including beach chairs, boogie boards, etc to enjoy on the beach. The beach itself is perfect for kids as the water never gets too deep and there are plenty of fish and coves to explore when snorkeling. The location was perfect. Quiet and restful, but close enough to the little town that restaurants, grocery stores (a Safeway and a Target), and the little beach town were just a few minutes drive. There's also a wonderful Poké shop a couple of minutes walk from the house. Cecelia, the guest liaison, has a property on the grounds and is always available if you need anything.

We will definitely do that next time but if you do choose to bus it, there is a stop right outside.\r\n\r\nJason's communication style is \"as little as possible, as much as necessary\" which is totally fine as long as you're not looking for someone to give you a warm welcome and make a personal connection with (we weren't)."},{"_id":"18479337","date":{"$date":"2014-08-27T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1624635","reviewer_id":"18008473","reviewer_name":"Danielle","comments":"Jason responded to our questions within a few hours although some amenities were not as expected (fridge is VERY small, no utensil, knives, bottle opener, etc) or available as advertised (wall AC unit and extra fan not available, no key for the pool). The location is great, just a short walk to beautiful turtle bay but you won't want to plan on spending much time at the unit. Airflow is minimal making the unit very hot when combined with the natural humidity of Hawaii. The linens were approximately hospital level quality, rough to the touch and towels were tiny, one each for 6 days. I would definitely make room in your suitcase to bring some from home as well as full size bed sheets. The price of this unit is hard to beat, especially for Hawaii, but understand that you get what you pay for.

The only thing that we had to provide ourselves was shampoo, conditioner and body wash. We kind of assumed that it would be provided, but the store wasn't too far and we got some that night. \nThe only complaint that we have is that a key fob wasn't provided for us; therefore, it made it difficult to get through the main gate to the complex and to the pool. Every time we got to the gate we had to call the owner to let us in and that only worked about half the time the other half we had to wait for someone to pull behind us and ask to use their key. We also had to ask to borrow someone else's key fob to get into the pool. Or hope that someone was in the pool that would let us in. However,  we only went to the pool a couple of times. \nOverall, a great place to stay.  We would stay there again if a key fob was provided.

The fact it comes with snorkel, mask and flippers for usage is great. Bodyboards available as well. The studio isn't large, about 25 square meters (270 sq. ft), but it is cosy. Like a nice hotel room, as mentioned in the description. However, the US$100 cleaning fee (more than the nightly cost of the room) seems quite excessive, given the size.\n\nThe studio is in a set of villas behind the Turtle Bay Resort. It is a nice location, walkable distance to the beach. We saw 4 turtles in the eponymous Turtle Bay. It is an easy drive to other parts of north shore, like Shark's Cove and Ted's Bakery. If your budget can stretch to it, dinner at Roy's Beach House (part of The Turtle Bay Resort) was delicious.\n\nUnfortunately, on arrival, the wifi wasn't working when we arrived and didn't work at all for our stay. As international guests, wifi is essential for us - we didn't have any other way to communicate. The TV wasn't working either, but hopefully this is something that Jason can quickly fix.\n\nAs hinted at in the description, parking is not available close to the villa. It is in the resort's public car park about 650m (1/3 mile) walk away. There is meant to be a key fob in the unit after check in, so you can still get through the villa gates at your own leisure, but this was missing for us."},{"_id":"317889302","date":{"$date":"2018-09-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1624635","reviewer_id":"22213672","reviewer_name":"Erik","comments":"Jason’s studio was perfect for my wife and I during our last trip to Hawaii.

We have some of the best diving and snorkeling in Hawaii right off our shores and steps from Surf Temple.","notes":"Watching the sunset on the beach across the street is a fantastic experience! Feel free to take a snack and beverage to the beach, rest on a blanket and watch the gorgeous colors emerge.","transit":"Proximity to Airports: Surf Temple is just twenty minutes (20) from Kona (KOA) Airport and 1.5 hours from Hilo Airport (ITO). Even though Kona Airport is a small, it enjoys excellent service from the mainland including nonstop flights from Denver, San Francisco, and even Tokyo. Car Rental: while a car is not strictly necessary, we recommend renting a vehicle at the airport upon arrival.  The Big Island is huge with many places to see and without a car you will miss out on great opportunities to tour the island. A Jeep or pickup can be particularly fun and good for toting boogie boards, scuba gear, and outdoor toys as well as allowing access to some of the islands more rugged areas.","access":"Guests will have access to the entire house!

The short review: Simply put, if this home is available, book it quickly. The location is amazing, only a few footsteps across the street you have a beautiful beach (usually we were the only ones there) with lava rocks, some white sand, and amazing snorkeling. It's so close to the ocean that you can hear waves crashing from the house. The home is beautiful inside and out, updated and designed with amazing taste. The yard is very spacious and spread out. It is also located in a perfect location to snorkeling, surfing, dining out, grocery stores, Costco, but is secluded enough away from the busier parts of Kona that our family wanted to avoid. The owners of the home are also very friendly and helpful. I can't stress enough that this place is amazing and as we completely loved our stay here and plan to return again in the future.   A more detailed review: The house and grounds are beautiful and thoughtfully decorated. We also learned that the home was recently renovated as well with new appliances in the main kitchen and new bathrooms and showers. Tile floors throughout and around the house and also on the patio areas were great. The yards have beautiful landscaping with many tropical plants and trees. The patio areas have tons of space, outdoor fans, outdoor couches where you can relax and eat your meals on a beautiful wood table. A Weber BBQ was great for cooking, and a nice addition to the home. The insides of the living areas are impeccable, beautifully designed and furnished. It made us feel as if we were living inside of an interior decorated home featured in a magazine.   The home itself is actually two structures connected by a common roof. One half of the home is a spacious living room, full kitchen including: dish washer, full sized shower, bathroom, and a beautifully decorated large bedroom with a large closet. There's a very spacious patio area just in front of its entrance as well. The second structure is a large bedroom, a kitchenette, bathroom and a newly remodeled shower. This structure also has a private patio area and separate entrance. It also has a washer and drier.  I spent a few days of my trip doing snorkeling right across the street, taking photos and videos with my GoPro, and diving at this spot and really loved it. I saw hundreds of tropical fish, cool reefs, and even a turtle. The water was very clear, too!   My family of four booked this location at the last minute for our yearly holiday vacation over Christmas and NYE. The condos that were available at the time looked okay, but this house was at another level. We'll definitely be recommending it to friends who want an amazing place to rent while staying in Hawaii. On top of everything else the owners were quick to respond, very friendly, and a..."},{"_id":"126182636","date":{"$date":"2017-01-09T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16253247","reviewer_id":"33042684","reviewer_name":"Angela","comments":"A great house in a great location. It's on the main street that goes through downtown Kona about 4 miles south of downtown. There is a rocky beach behind the house across the street, and we could hear the ocean at night. It's about a 5 minute walk from a really nice beach that is popular with surfers and snorkelers. We didn't surf here but we did snorkel. It was a great, clear spot with lots of fish. The location is great for seeing Kona and all the great spots around it, such as Honaunau and Kealakekua Bay (with a car). Because it's on one of the main roads, there was a bit of road traffic, and the neighbors were a bit loud on Friday night, but all the great amenities made up for it. There is a very modern main house with one bedroom and a very nice kitchen, bathroom and living space, and a separate ohana (a mother-in-law suite) a few feet away with a shared patio. This would be a great place to for 2 couples so each could have some privacy. Although the ohana suite just has a kitchenette so any cooking of meals would be easier in the main house. The hosts don't live nearby so all communication was by text, but we had no problems.

The two seperate spaces provided the perfect amount of privacy for two couples while still having a good common gathering space on the shared lanai. Both the ohana and main house were beautifully decorated and cozy. Both beds were so comfortable and the bedding felt soft and luxurious. The home is a very quick drive into the main shopping area while still being far enough away to feel less touristy and congested. It's also close to many coffee farms, manta ray dives, the Painted Church, and Kealakekua bay. The beach across the street is lovely to watch the water but a five minute walk down the road leads to another beach for surfing and snorkeling. It's rocky, but the water was very clear and full of brightly-colored reef fish and sea turtles. It was so nice to have in easy walking distance. I would recommend this home to anyone and everyone.

It is such a gem. \n\nThe house is beautiful, perfectly clean, and appointed with everything we needed. We had a wonderful time cooking meals in the open kitchen and eating on the big lanai table. The front yard is filled with Plumaria trees which made our entire stay smell like we were staying in a spa. My partner and I loved the big master shower (big enough for two!), and we both thought the master bed was the comfiest bed we've ever slept in. Both of us have back pain at times, and this bed was perfect as it was very soft but still supportive. The cool cross-breeze from the open windows (with screens) helped us both sleep very well.\n\nSurfTemple had a unique advantage because it essentially is two separate cottages, each with its own master suite, connected by a shared patio. Our friends stayed in the smaller master suite and had a great time. It was nice to be able to go somewhere with friends and feel that we were connected and staying together, but we also each had our own privacy. The smaller suite also has its own little kitchen, convenient for midnight snacks.\n\nWe really enjoyed staying in the area. We swam with turtles in Kalahu'u Bay, just a two-minute walk down the road. It was a blast. We also enjoyed hanging out in the very nearby downtown Kona area and trying out the restaurants. We scuba dived with Jack's Diving Locker at the recommendation of our hosts and had a blast!  We also tried Gypsea Gelato at their recommendation and it was amazing!!  Highly recommended. \n\nWe found SurfTemple to be very well located in the area. There are grocery stores and all of the essentials very close by, and there is easy access to Kona and the tourist destinations. \n\nWe very much enjoyed walking to the public beach access that is directly across the street from SurfTemple and watching the sunset every night. It is great to have the ocean so close! It felt like we had our own private beach right across the road. \n\nWe loved our time and can't wait to return! \n\nRebecca and Mattias "},{"_id":"154951518","date":{"$date":"2017-05-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16253247","reviewer_id":"65547003","reviewer_name":"Ingibjörg","comments":"I stayed at SurfTemple with my family for a few nights.

They are joined by a common roof but each has its own large covered tile deck with exterior living rooms as well as dining areas. This area was so great for an evening thunderstorm which we fortunately got on one of our nights. The patter of rain on the roof with a glass of wine and some candles provided for quite the romantic eve. Bed was so amazingly comfortable.

The bedrooms are not in the same house and everyone had his own bathroom and kitchen (and even balcony), which was perfect.\nThe house is located 10 minutes by car from Center of Kona. Also 5 minutes walk there is a beach near the house.\n\nThe living room is shared and Amy let us her Netflix account, amazon tv and etc open. Which was pretty cool during the rainy days.\n\nUnfortunately the house is named Surf Temple but didn't have much beach gear (bodyboards, sun umbrella, chairs,...etc). \n\nWe spend almost 10 days in october. I don't know if this was due to the season but the inconvenient part was that there were tiny little red worms with many legs. The more it rains, the more the house had them. Everything was closed but the worms always found a way to get everywhere inside of the house. Once I even got bitten by one of them, while sleeping in my bed. \n\nIn case you forgot to set the alarm, no worries cause there is also a bird waking you up loudly every morning around 6 a.m. ;-)\n\nPs. The Gypsy ice cream are very delicious!!"},{"_id":"351742027","date":{"$date":"2018-11-23T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16253247","reviewer_id":"41208219","reviewer_name":"Harriet","comments":"SurfTemple was as great as billed by previous guests.

The decor is soothing and not overwhelming. So many windows and fresh ocean breeze’s! Great location. We appreciated being able to walk to the beach across the street and down the road. Just a overall great spot to stay on the island. The food choices in the area are wonderful and you are close to grocery stores and best of all, farm markets\n\nThis is my 4th time to the island - we usually stay in condos or hotels.

We contacted host 2hrs prior without response (all available forms) until we contacted Airbnb (1hr) to support. This left is suspecting we may need an alternate location, which I’m sure was never the case (got hold 20 minutes before checkin). It would have been the hosts normal style (my perception). The access to the apartment using the instructions we were provided which were on a weekend, meant we needed to follow someone else in to gain access to the security building (hint you can walk through the Vietnamese restaurant if it is open). Also the instruction to get the key were insufficient as there was no information about where the letterboxes are (hint they are located in the middle of the entire building hint which is outside the gym) also to find the key once you locate the letterboxes (hint the key was attached to sticky tape inside the locked letterbox). This treasure hunt is fun if you enjoy puzzles. However If it is raining and you’re in a rush, this is not desirable. The place is in a great location and proximity to events and the views are certainly amazing. The pictures of the spaces are not current and some wear and tear (expected from time to time) is evident (texta marks on tv cabinet which sadly I suspect are from previous guests with kids). The couch has been torn (again sadly for host, probably from a prior guest). The shower required more effort cleaning (visible module in grout) and the drainage is poor as it filled the shower area which overflows into the main bathroom area. For any future guests who choose to stay here for any length of stay, I would recommend that you bring your own things like dishwasher tablets etc. I am confident if these few things are reviewed by the host, this place would receive more favourable reviews and increase its utilisation / price.

Chelsea's condo suited our family of 2 adults and 2 older teenage boys (16 \u0026 17) perfectly as it was close to shops and restaurants so we didn't always need to use the car.  \n\nThere's a small beach, although it's quite rocky, so better beaches are within easy driving distance.  We made great use of the boogie boards, beach chairs and towels - cool to know about these in advance so we didn't have to pack any! \n\nLahaina is more established and has much more character than many of the other newer parts of the island, which we liked. My husband celebrated his 50th with a great game of golf with our sons at nearby Kapalua, where we spent our honeymoon 21 years ago!  Meanwhile I had a great massage in nearby Kaanapali and shopped at the outlet mall.\n\nThat night we booked dinner at Lahaina Grill, which came highly recommended, but we found it disappointing and very expensive - it felt like going back to the 80's.  Fortunately the kitchen at the condo was extremely well-equipped with great appliances and utensils.  As my husband is a chef, we often went out for lunch and enjoyed some lovely meals at home instead.\n\nHiring a car is recommended and we had some great trips to Hana and up to see the sunset at Haleakala National Park.  All in all a great holiday and some fabulous family memories.

It's lovely and spacious, with a big kitchen stocked with utensils and supplies. The bedrooms are nice and big, and the beds felt like you were sleeping on a cloud. They are also fit out with and TV's and A/C in both. The bathroom was my favourite - the shower is just gorgeous - and it's stocked with a washing machine and dryer so you can do some laundry.\nThe location is a short 5 minute walk to Front St, where there are shops and cafes and, of course, the stunning waterfront. It's also quiet as there is not a lot of street noise.\nThe resort has two pools which we made use of and they were well maintained. There are also BBQ's on site if you want to use them, but I suggest you get in early as every night they were in use. \nParking is a $20 fee per night, but we were lucky to score street parking for a few nights so we only had to pay for one night in the parking lot across the street which is a bit cheaper than the resort fee at $15 per night.\nThe condo has an info folder full of tips and recommendations, as well as a cute guest book for you to sign and read, which I highly recommend you do as you will pick up some great tips! \nMy only suggestion would be to maybe have a manual that tells you how to operate the TV? We struggled with this a bit as we don't have Spectrum, but once we worked it out we were fine. \nWe absolutely loved it here - a lovely property in a stunning location. I'd happily stay again."},{"_id":"281459991","date":{"$date":"2018-06-24T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16262122","reviewer_id":"35254210","reviewer_name":"Kristina","comments":"Definitely recommend!

Her beautiful condo is exactly as advertised.  We really appreciated that her condo was very, very clean: no musty odors/mold, clean carpets, no pet odors, no smoke, etc b/c we have 2 in the family with really bad allergies which spark asthma.  On entering her condo, we knew we were going to be very comfortable.  We had everything we needed (linens, extra towels, boogie board, beach chairs, umbrella, and well equipped kitchen, etc).  Location was absolutely fabulous,secure, and central to everything. The property's pools and whirlpool were very convenient and natural/peaceful, and felt really luxurious to us.  We also used the nearby outside grill!  Our only regret was having to evacuate early on due to Hurricane Lane causing a wildfire that quickly approached the property.  We checked on the property almost every day just to make sure it was okay, and we were so relieved that it was spared.  Chelsea never gave us grief about our resultant reservation changes.  Rather, she was understanding, and above all, unexpectedly gracious.  Now THAT'S Aloha spirit!  Without question, we would request another stay at her beautiful property!

Public transport is also easily accessible. When we arrived, Victoria was there to welcome us. Also, she was flexible about the check out time (as our flight was in the evening she allowed us to leave our luggage at her place so we did not have to carry it with us when walking around the city during the day of departure). Previous reviews already mention that it is quite noisy at the appartment (the appartment faces a big street and the traffic is heavy). I took ear plugs with me and it helped. Ultimately, this did not ruin our trip, it is just something to consider when staying there. Also, another couple was staying there but this was not a problem either (I expected there to be a line when taking a shower, as some previous reviews mention but this was not the case at all). Maybe our schedules were just very different but for us it was not a problem sharing a bathroom.

The neighborhood may have rents higher than Gramercy and more crowds than Soho, but it’s popular for a reason: The quaint streets are lined with inventive New York restaurants, rooftop bars and eclectic shops, and throngs of people flock to the waterfront for flea markets and giant food bazaars during the summer. Once among the city’s most industrial neighborhoods, Williamsburg emerged as the gritty epicenter of New York’s counter-culture in the late 1980’s. The plentiful supply of dormant factories and warehouses served as a useful landscape for many of the city’s most significant and pioneering visual artists, musicians, poets, and experimental theater. By the late 90’s, Williamsburg became an international icon as a “hipster-haven” and a hotbed of youth culture.

I would 100% recommend booking with Ann if you have the opportunity, you will not regret it! My opinion… THE best Airbnb in Brooklyn area… and that’s coming from someone who travels A LOT!

The apartment is located in the eastern part of Williamsburg, away from the buzz around Bedford but close enough to walk there as well as to Bushwick. And with the L train only three blocks away (and more options available just a little further away) it's very handy to go anywhere in the city. The neighborhood itself also has a lot to offer and the hosts helped us out with several terrific bar and restaurant recommendations. Don't miss the Taiwanese place on the corner!\n\nThe apartment itself is nice and spacious and had everything we needed on our four-day stay. Nothing to complain about whatsoever.\n\nFinally, the hosts: Everything worked perfectly there as well.

The bed is placed in a space between living room and kitchen with no window. So in summer trips you have to consider leaving both doors open to have fresh air but the trade off is the noise and lights from the street. It is a good size apartment  but the facilities and amenities both in kitchen and bathroom are not adequate if you are on business trip. We struggled to have shower as the bath tub kept blocking.\n\nNo dishwasher no washing machine no iron and iron board which you would need if you are staying more then few days or have limited outfit that you have to wash and iron \n\nThere are cafe and restaurants nearby and a big market if you want to have your coffee brewed at home in the mornings as there was no tea or coffee supplied for guests otherwise.\n\nStacy was kind enough to let us check in early morning with a little extra cash payment to the cleaner\nOur overall judgment for the place was that it needs a little improvement and review pricing."},{"_id":"283775126","date":{"$date":"2018-06-30T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16271513","reviewer_id":"13505963","reviewer_name":"Justin","comments":"Thanks to Stacy and Mohammed for helping make my stay in NYC so great!

I️ point this out because many of the Airbnb apartments I’ve stayed at in the past have been very nice inside the apartment itself, but unfortunately the building/lobby/hallway have not always been the nicest. This one had one of the nicest entrances/lobbies, if not the nicest. As for getting around the city, we were able to walk anywhere, but if you prefer to ride, cabs are conveniently parked directly in front of the building on a daily basis.

There is a spacious feel so that 8 of us felt very comfortable in the 4 bedrooms and 3 baths. Everything was sparkling clean and the beds were comfortable and made up with crisp white sheets. The kitchen was well equipped.  Location is perfect—we walked everywhere but the metro and São Bento train station were very close by. The building is secure with a handsome lobby—lots of marble—and an elevator.  We were out during most of the daytime hours but visitors who spend time in the back bedrooms of the apartment during the day might be aware of construction going on in other parts of the building. \nWe thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend it for others—we would request to stay in Luis’ apartment should we be fortunate enough to visit Porto again."},{"_id":"267303559","date":{"$date":"2018-05-21T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16288457","reviewer_id":"10839293","reviewer_name":"Ueli","comments":"Schöne Unterkunft, ziemlich gute Lage, hat Duschtücher.

We also had an Uber driver who told us the neighbourhood was not a good one (in his actual words, one of the worse neighbourhoods in Brooklyn) and so we were somewhat concerned about taking the subway home when we came back late.\n\nSecondly, and most importantly, if you are planning on doing most of your sightseeing in Manhattan, this is not the right place for you as a one way trip to Central Park or Times Square will take close to an hour door to door with a 10 min walk to the subway at Kingston Throop. This made it extremely inconvenient to head back to the apartment for a rest.\n\nHowever, Gerard's place was very nicely done up and exactly as the pictures show. The beds were very comfortable and clean. \n\nSo if you happen to be visiting Brooklyn specifically, perhaps this place would suit. However, I would not recommend staying here if you intend to spend most of your time in Manhattan. There are plenty of other options that are a lot closer to a subway and Manhattan."},{"_id":"142885509","date":{"$date":"2017-04-09T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16301294","reviewer_id":"34006653","reviewer_name":"Alan","comments":"This place is amazing, the pictures don't do this place justice.

As for security the neighborhood is very safe. We went back every day very late at night and we were always safe, there are many people, it is always very close. The access to the transport is very good, the subway is only five to eight minutes walking and connects Manhatan to the lower in fifteen minutes, midtown in 30 minutes and uper in perhaps 40 minutes, always with a single line (the A Or C) without the need to make combinations.

We spent 8 nights in Philly's apartment. The location was really good due to the fact that it was just an approx. 3 minutes walk to the MTR station and there are a plenty of restaurants, cafes and bakeries in walking distance. Unfortunately, the apartment was really cold (it was end of December/beginning of January) and it took us a long time to heat it a bit. Philly had bought a small heater, which was really helpful. She also provided us an instruction for the apartment, which was really nice. The bathroom was not that clean and one of our beds wasn't either. To be honest we expected a bit more, the interior was spartan and it doesn't feel like 'home'. Unless the kitchen was a bit dirty we enjoyed it to have one. It was also great that we could use the coffee and tea.\nWe also appreciated the flexible check out time.

The roof top was actually not prepared however in summer times quite a nice place to spend some time. All in all we had a great stay. The apartment is in the 7th floor w/o any lift.

Dock finns det bara två stolar innomhus. Bordet på terrassen har fyra stolar men själva bordet är litet så det bästa är att ha maten inne och gå ut och sätta sig. Det skulle vara bra med ett bord att fälla upp innomhus de dagar det regnar. Köket är sparsamt utrustat, men fungerar fint för enklare matlagning. Stekpannan är väldigt liten.\nSitsen i den lilla toaletten är trasig och det finns ingen hållare till toapappret på någon av toaletterna. Vattnet i duschen rinner undan långsamt och det blir lätt en sjö på golvet. \nLägenheten har ett mycket bra läge med nära till metro som tar dig över hela stan! Nära att promenera också! Finns mataffär och lekplats nära och varje lördag är det marknad utanför dörren!\nDet sämsta med lägenheten är allt oljud från trafiken, det är svårt att sitta på terrassen och koppla av. Det är också mycket ljud från grannarna i sovrummet vid ytterdörren.\nDet finns ett litet skjul på terrassen där tvättmaskinen finns, det skulle behöva städas och slänga gammalt skräp som står där.

The location was v handy between two subway lines and perfect to come back to after a day exploring Manhattan; a welcome haven away from the noise and bustle, with great restaurants and bars nearby.  We loved Rabbithole, Egg, Diner, Maison Premiere, the Ides bar - and picking up snacks from Wholefoods. Fab area for vintage shops too.

It is such a central location to all subway lines, and walkable to many amazing restaurants and different parts of town. It was so easy to get anywhere we wanted to go! The street that the studio is on is so cute, very quaint and felt like a neighborhood. After exploring other parts of town that we considered staying in, I'm so glad we picked the West Village. \n\nThe studio itself was great, more updated and spacious than I anticipated (it's perfect for a couple, but might be a little tight if you have more than 2 people). There's a a small kitchen with all the amenities you'd need, plus Teddy provides snacks and other things that you can have. She was also very easy to get a hold of!

She was very accommodating when it came to our arrival/departure times and luggage. Couldn't have made it easier for us to enjoy the city and make use of every minute we were staying here for.  Her hospitality went beyond what could be expected - with a full tour of the spacious and adorable apartment as well as recommendations of places to go to in the area.  Very cute place; super clean, comfy fluffy bed, big flat screen, full kitchen, and the shower was heavenly!!!  Did I mention how spacious it was for NYC? 2x bigger than any hotel we've stayed in before. Can't stress enough how amazing this experience was and how we will absolutely be coming back next time we visit. Five stars all the way!!!

The apartment is compact but perfect for two people with a kitchen that is quite well equipped. The West Village is an amazing neighbourhood with beautiful streets, great bars and restaurants and the subway is very close by for easy access to other parts of Manhattan. The apartment is only one floor up so there is some street noise but even on fri/sat nights it wasn't too bad (the apartment itself faces a smaller quiet street). Teddy is a considerate, friendly and caring host and checked in on us several times during our stay.

The apartment is in a great location-close to great restaurants and sites, but pretty quiet for the city.

The wonderful rain shower had good pressure and never lacked hot water. \n\nWe were glad to have a fridge to save waters and leftovers. Though small, the  kitchen had all the utensils and amenities to make coffee and cook a meal. We never took advantage of that though, because we were out enjoying the tastes of the city.\n\nThe bed is firm, which my friend loved. It’s not quite soft enough for me, but did not inhibit a decent night’s sleep. \n\nAlthough we stayed during some cold weather and snow, the apartment stayed warm and cozy. There is even a small heater to help warm you up after a long day of exploring outside. \n\nTeddy was a great host, and always responded quickly to us.

My daughter lived in NYC for several years and we have found that the Village works perfect for us. We are familiar with the restaurants, bars, subways, etc. Teddy did leave a great amount of information, should others not be familiar with the area. This apartment was perfect for us and could easily accommodate 2 more people, but it could be a bit crowded for 4 adults. There is a queen bed and then a queen Murphy bed. For the two of us, it couldn’t be more perfect. We thought the beds and linens were very comfortable with nice duvet covers and additional pillows and blankets available. There is an area to hang your clothes and hangers are provided. The bathroom is just a tad small, but it totally works and the towels provided were soft and fluffy. Although we did not cook, there were plenty of plates, utensils and cooking options. The WiFi works great and the TV is equipped with Apple TV and for the minimal amount of time we watched, it was perfectly fine. The neighborhood is relatively quiet, but you will get the natural sounds of the city. We think the subway runs underneath the building, too, but it was not bothersome at all. Teddy communicated with us and led us directly to the keys with complete instructions on accessing the apartment. Easy for sure. We appreciated knowing that if we needed anything, we could text and get quick answers. This is a beautiful apartment and we will look to stay here again next year! Thanks, Teddy!!"},{"_id":"356519177","date":{"$date":"2018-12-08T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16316481","reviewer_id":"14352586","reviewer_name":"Cameron","comments":"The apartment was in a great central location easy walking distance north and south to the major tourist attractions.

You can not beat the location in the West Village. Washington Square Park, 2 subway stops within 2 blocks in either direction with half-a-dozen lines, and all the great restaurants, cafes, shops and bars that the West Village, Greenwich and Soho have to offer make this place unbeatable. \n\nBut it’s not just the location. The place is cozy, warm—we were there in December and it was great inside—and quiet. The kitchen and bathroom are clean, neat and updated. The bed is comfy and everything is crisp and fresh. \n\nAs a host, Teddy is extremely considerate and helpful. Check-in and check-out are a breeze. Any questions or issues we had were quickly responded to and addressed. For example, we had  trouble connecting to the internet (problem on the provider side, not the WiFi in apartment). Teddy called it in, and someone came out that day to fix the problem in the area.

The space has everything you need, from shampoo to a hairdryer, to coffee and cookware, etc. The bed that pulls out of the wall is actually more comfortable in my opinion- the other is on the firmer side (just not my thing). Teddy was super responsive and helpful, and understanding when we got stuck in winter storms and our flights were delayed! He is very easy to work with so thank you, Teddy! Our only complaint whatsoever is that the building is quite noisy- light sleepers may struggle a bit. It probably depends when you go as well. \n\nThanks for everything Teddy!"}]}

They give you privacy if you want it, but are always available to help with suggestions on where to go, what to do, how, when etc. They would print out directions and they even took us to one of the gorgeous beaches themselves! Plus, Coralie took care of our laundry, so we could go out and explore the island earlier. We could borrow a beach umbrella, snorkeling equipment… well, just anything you can think of and does not fit into your suitcase.

The walls may be a bit thin if there are couples in each room. It's all simply screens with the great outdoors very present inside. Sleeping was great with a quick outside trip to the bathroom. A few feet across the lawn is the shared kitchen and lanai where I spent most of my time. Great kitchen with everything needed and clean. Bring something to cook. Great view from the lanai to share yours meal and hangout. The hosts are well traveled and will leave you alone or talk your ear off,it was up to me. Nice folks. The flowers and plants are amazing, don't bring aloe, just ask Chris where to pick some. Sitting on the lanai will be some of my best memories from the islands, after swimming and hot days the evenings are spectacular. Great masks, snorkel, and fins to use, better than mine. I love how mellow the big island is, this was my 2nd trip and have stayed in six different places, for a solo traveler this met my need of serenity big time. I will be back and probably with my wife.

What a wonderful place. The hosts get to live on this beautiful coffee farm all the time. So great that they could share it with us for a few days. The grounds are a farm loaded with tropical fruit and trees. The day and night sounds of birds and frogs are exotic and soothing at the same time. It sits 1000 feet above the ocean but still close enough to see whale spouts. The cottage was very comfortable. We stayed in both the Jacaranda and the Plumeria rooms and found them both very comfortable. There is a nice shared bathroom and the shared kitchen is very well equipped. There is a large ocean view lanai next to the kitchen. We enjoyed our many conversations with our wonderful hosts very much.

Coralie and Chris are amazing hosts - they were there to show us around when we arrived, and even before we arrived, gave us advice on sites and travel distances (we had an early morning scuba dive reservation back up in Kailua-Kona).\r\n\r\nThe room is adorable and amazing - I loved how the big screen window overlooks the forest.  The bathroom and kitchen are - this sounds odd - so much fun!  I've never had big screens for windows in my bedroom, bathroom, and kitchen overlooking such a beautiful, lush environment.  \r\n\r\nWe had some decent rainstorms while we were there that were above and beyond a tropical a rain.  This led to a bit of a humid chill in the air, so if you're the type to get chilled easily, I would bring a comfortable long sleeve shirt for the evenings.\r\n\r\nThe lanai was such a peaceful place to have our breakfast and dinner.  I kept looking in one direction - the trees on the farm, and then the other direction - the view of the ocean, and never sure which view I wanted to face as I ate.  These are the kinds of problems you want, when you're on vacation.  :-)\r\n\r\nThe birds in the morning were ridiculously chatty - I personally loved every minute of it.  It was such a peaceful experience waking up to their song.  I walked around in the morning capturing 30 second little videos of the view and their songs so I could remember my experience here.  \r\n\r\nWe only had 5 nights on The Big Island, and two of those were with Chris and Coralie. It was not nearly enough.  We will definitely be back.\r\n\r\nMahalo, Coralie and Chris!"},{"_id":"10207047","date":{"$date":"2014-02-06T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1633034","reviewer_id":"10972992","reviewer_name":"Jeff","comments":"Kris and Coralie were wonderful hosts and the room we rented from them was clean and comfortable.

We enjoyed the outdoor feel of the shower and bathroom, while still being able to have the luxury of hot fresh water. I loved the little geckos and lizards that where waiting for me every morning when I brushed by teeth. \r\n\r\nThere was a great small market a couple of miles away and the kitchen had everything we needed to prepare our meals. If you don't want to cook one night you can't go wrong with Jake's Big Island BBQ just up the road, the brisket is the best we have ever had and we try BBQ everywhere we travel. \r\n\r\nIt was also nice to have coolers and snorkel gear available to use when we needed it. The location can't be beat with two great beaches within a couple of miles from home. The painted church is a nice short 1/4 mile walk and worth the time to see.\r\n\r\nCoralee and Kris are great hosts, offering us directions and ideas of activities. We stayed here for our anniversary and Coralee even greeted us that morning with a thoughtful card wishing us well. We are planning to stay in touch which them so that if they choose to move on to other areas of the world we can come stay with them there too!\r\n\r\nThank you for a great stay, we hope to see you again soon.\r\n  "},{"_id":"10382248","date":{"$date":"2014-02-17T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1633034","reviewer_id":"10890637","reviewer_name":"Yvan","comments":"The farm is located around 20 mins south of Kona.  It is fairly large and there are many trees, which means you get to eat some of the local fruits.  We loved the morning papayas, bananas and passion fruits (lilikois)! \r\n\r\nThe hosts rent a couple of bungalow-style rooms on the farm.  The bathroom is separate from the rooms - you have to walk a few steps outside to reach it from your room.  The room was large and clean.  You have to get used to living \"in\" the nature: you take your showers with the geckos; also the local frogs (coqui), which are widespread over the whole island, can be quite loud during the night. (they are noisier at other locations on the island). Nevertheless the bathroom was neat and clean. We also appreciated the washing machine that is available for guests to use.  There is also snorkeling equipment that guests can borrow. \r\n\r\nA kitchen is available and shared (with fridge space) and you can eat on the outside patio \"lanai\" with a view on the ocean.  A beach where you can swim with dolphins is only 15 mins away (by car, which you will need) and the volcano park is around 1h45 away.  \r\n\r\nThe owners were very kind and helpful.  They told us where to find the beaches with dolphins and turtles and we really enjoyed that. \r\n\r\nOverall we had a quiet, relaxing stay in some sort of Eden garden!

For me, a perfect combination of low price (a rare thing in Kona) and comfort.  I wish I had been able to spend a few more days there, as I only found it at the end of my trip.  With more time I would like to have had a proper explore of the farm and surroundings, and shared some stories with Coralie and Kris!  Sadly I was soon on the plane home with a bag of their excellent coffee and the noise of the frogs ringing in my ears.\r\n\r\nNight-time in Hawaii is pitch dark, pleasantly cool and alive with noises and it seems wrong to shut it all away in an air-conditioned room.  On the other hand you wouldn't actually want to share your bed with most of the noise-makers. Therefore I appreciate the care that seems to have gone into making the room open and airy whilst preventing the critters from actually coming in.  \r\n\r\nEqually while it's great to go off-grid for a while, the realities of trying to co-ordinate with friends half way across the planet mean that I was grateful for both a wall socket and wifi.\r\n\r\nThanks for a great couple of nights, and hopefully I'll be back for longer at some point in the future."},{"_id":"11311047","date":{"$date":"2014-03-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1633034","reviewer_id":"13023599","reviewer_name":"Sara","comments":"We had a wonderful experience and give our highest recommendation!

The positive experience began even before I applied for their advertised room, when I needed information on Hawaii.  Coralie was generous with her time and honest with the information.  Her replies made it possible for me to figure out how much time I needed on the Big Island.  She replied very promptly, usually within hours.  \r\n\r\nThe room was just as advertised as was all other information they had up about the kitchen and bathroom (both shared).  There was enough shelf-space in each of the three places, clearly marked for each guest.  They keep a very clean and neat establishment.  They interact with you as much as you would like to, and I never felt imposed upon, or pressured to join in.  \r\n\r\nIt might be of concern to some people - and it is not something that would prevent me from staying there again - is that the two guest rooms are next to each other and sounds carry easily.  My neighbour had to knock on my door to ask me to turn off the fan which made a groaning noise at low speed.  \r\n\r\nHowever, I repeat that I would go and stay with them again without a second thought.  This is because of their genuine personal interest in their guests' welfare.  They gave thoughtful advice, shared  their vast knowledge of the island, and were always cheerful when accosted for information or advice.  I had a late evening flight, but was asked to leave my bags in their office while I went off to the beach.  I was allowed to use the just-cleaned bathroom after I returned.  In fact, Coralie had even helped me with washing up while I was away , she even put out the wet clothes to dry, and folded them when I was away on my last trip.  Clearly an example of 'above and beyond' service.  And, during an emergency, Coralie unhesitatingly allowed me the use of her personal washroom while the shared guest bathroom was occupied.  \r\n\r\nMoreover, a great touch was her giving me a Hawaii calendar for 2015 in memory of my trip and to remember them for the whole year.  \r\n\r\nThank you very much, Coralie and Kris, for allowing me to stay in your home and for your various generosities.

Warm and friendly, and super helpful with tips of hikes and local places to go, and snorkeling hints for beginners,with equipment to borrow. We loved the relaxed captain cook area, and our favorite scenic beaches ended up being right there. Its greener and a bit cooler temp than kailua. This is not a \"resort\" type of experience but there is a comfortable bed, a good, hot shower, a full kitchen and a great deck with an ocean view to sit and eat or read. The birds are a bit loud in the early am, but it gets you up for the best part of Hawaii (often it rained in afternoon, which is a great time to come back for a lovely, very quiet nap!), and to me the birds are more pleasant than the loud air circulating things in hotel rooms. You definitely feel immersed in a natural setting, and we loved that. Bring earplugs if you think you need them, maybe bug spray (I didn't because I hate it, they were there but not horrible). We loved making smoothies with the yummy fruit left for us each morning from the farm.

On our second night here, my husband and I ate dinner on the lanai while listening to an NPR podcast at half volume on a laptop. At 7:40 pm, the owner came out onto the porch of his house, about 100-200 feet uphill, and started yelling, “Turn it off! Turn it off!” So we did. Creepily, he then watched us silently from his porch for about ten more minutes, staring at us as we finished our dinner. We washed our dishes and went to bed after he finally went back inside.\r\n\r\nThis was the most extreme moment, but it was representative of a more widespread problem at Paliuli. There were rules posted everywhere and more passed on in person: No food or drink in rooms. Quiet hours between 9 pm and 8 am (which our dinnertime transgression was well outside). Damp towels not to be hung in your room or on the porch, but only on the clothesline. Any fruit provided should be considered a sample; don’t expect it to meet your fruit needs. Don’t talk on your cell phone outside. Avoid using the bathroom after dark or in the morning (the light might wake up neighbors). Don’t roll your suitcase. \r\n\r\nJanis and Thomas, the caretakers, were responsive and responsible—I can see why there have been such stellar reviews in the past—but my best Airbnb experiences have involved trust. I didn’t feel that here. My husband and I are quiet, rule-following guests—as we tried to be at Paliuli—but I found it the opposite of relaxing to spend my time at Paliuli on tiptoe."},{"_id":"60122438","date":{"$date":"2016-01-19T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1633034","reviewer_id":"14980310","reviewer_name":"Franziska","comments":"Thomas and Janis are very friendly people.

Pode-se chegar a pé a qualquer um dos dois bairros. Ipanema abriga um comércio elegante e a pedra do Arpoador, que está localizada bem próximo ao edifício, de onde se pode assistir ao por do sol mais belo da cidade, que merece aplausos! Caminhando na direção de Copacabana, encontra-se o Forte que tem o nome do bairro. A vista dali é deslumbrante, um lugar perfeito para fotos, além disso há uma filial da tradicional Confeitaria Colombo, onde se pode lanchar apreciando a paisagem do mar de Copacabana. A rua paralela, a Francisco Otaviano, abriga diversos bares e lanchonetes, entre eles o TT Burguer e o Pizza Hut. Se você gosta de esportes, uma dica imperdível é fazer o Stand Up Paddle na Praia de Copacabana, no Posto 6. Caminhar pela praia é uma boa opção de passeio, tanto pelo calçadão como pela areia. E você pode escolher: praia de Ipanema ou de Copacabana.","notes":"","transit":"Muita coisa pode se fazer a pé.

Although Adam was outside the city during our arrival and stay, he made other arrangements for us to obtain the apartment keys and let ourselves in. We never actually got to meet Adam but he was extremely easy to contact and responded to all our inquiries. He also offered some helpful advice on where to shop/eat locally. The apartment is small but was exactly how it is pictured, it is located within a very short walking distance to the NYC Subway (which we used extensively with ease), a local grocery store and pharmacy (where we picked up items for breakfast and snacks), as well as local food places and shops. The apartment is located in West Village, and was relatively quiet during our stay so we had no worries about being kept awake after a long day in New York City. The only downside of the apartment was that it is located on the fifth floor (something Adam mentions already in his description) of the building and doesn't have an elevator. Not a big deal to us but to a single person or older couple with a lot of luggage this might be a hassle. The heat didn't help our climb to the apartment but luckily Adam has air conditioning! Overall, Adam was an excellent host, and we would definitely stay there again if we returned to NYC.

I have long hair, so I'm often frustrated with poor water pressure in hotels, and the pressure in this apartment was fantastic. The only downside was the building central heating, not individually controlled, that was very hot, but I know this is true in most buildings in NYC during the winter.

We spent many an evening on the expansive terrace off our bedroom, enjoyed coming home to fresh towels and a made bed, were pleased to find everything we needed was already available, and loved how easy it was to walk to many of Istanbul's highlights from our front door. The Greystone team was a sheer delight - helpful, friendly, generous, and fun. I highly recommend staying with them and I personally can't wait to return.

I stayed in apartment 2 which was on the first floor. You get a lot for you money, big apartment with tall ceilings, very tastefully (and newly) decorated and with a huge terrace which was nice but I hardly used it as I was out so much. \n\nThe host was very friendly and communicative. In terms of location it's within a stone's throw from the main shopping and nightlife of Taksim but enough out the way that it won't disturb your sleep. Restaurants, cash machines etc are all less than a five minute walk. It's barely a minute from the main road so you're not walking deep into a potentially dodgy neighbourhood. Do your (Hidden by Airbnb) maps homework before you get there and it's easy enough to find. \n\nI took the Havatas bus from Attaturk Airport which took around 50 mins and dropped me off in Taksim (Point hotel). From there it was about a 15/20 minute walk. If you come with suitcases however you'll want to get a cab as the pavements in Istanbul are not build for cases! Next time I'm in Istanbul I'll definitely be coming back here.

The place was cleaned 3 days out of the week by the live in house keeper, Hatije, who was an unexpected but very welcomed surprise. 10 min walk to Taksim square with plenty of great places to eat every day, or fresh vegetables from the markets right outside the front door!  If you stay here, you must go have a bite to eat at Merhi, it's great place to have some traditional Turkish home-cooked foods. The Turkish rice pilaf is an instant favorite of ours now. We heard some news of some areas being dangerous, but never felt a bit in danger ourselves and we traveled all throughout the city. We will stay here again and again every chance we get to return!

The outside does not look appealing but everything looks good and clean inside. Our 2 bedrooms unit was perfect for the family of 7 (5adults, 2toddlers). The kitchen has full amenities to accommodate our cooking needs. The bedrooms and bathrooms were clean. The location is perfect as well. It is in a nice quiet neighborhood but only 5 minutes drive back to Waikiki. The bus stop is a block away. What made it so welcoming was the host himself. He was so kind to offer tips on where to visit and what to do. He personally brought us a pineapple and pick fruits from his backyard such as mangoes and bananas to give them to us. He checked in often to make sure we got everything we need for the stay. The rental home has umbrellas, beach mat, coolers, life jackets and beach toys that we were able to use for our beach days. There are coin washer and dryer for our convenience as well. There’s also one parking spot for us. The driveway to get into the parking spot is a little narrow but we were aware and it’s pretty normal in Hawaii due to the limited space. Overall our stay was very pleasant and a lot of that has to do with having a great host. The host can speak Mandarin, Cambodian, Vietnamese, and English FYI. He also have other units next door that are more updated and can accommodate bigger families up to 9-10 people. \n\nThanks again Billy. I hope to be back in the near future and will definitely rent from you again."},{"_id":"277193565","date":{"$date":"2018-06-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16370766","reviewer_id":"151826316","reviewer_name":"Esmeralda","comments":"Billy was an awesome host, at first when we got to the area, we were a little bit scared because the houses around there they're very old and not good taking care of, but when we got to the apartment it was very clean and very organized, everything is really close by and we loved it... we definitely will stay again if we go back to Oahu..."},{"_id":"280255554","date":{"$date":"2018-06-22T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16370766","reviewer_id":"194403579","reviewer_name":"Wayne","comments":"Good service"},{"_id":"284654834","date":{"$date":"2018-07-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16370766","reviewer_id":"188983058","reviewer_name":"琳琳","comments":"房间整洁干净温馨,通风良好,采光通透,特别喜欢厨房和卧室的窗户,外面是绿绿的芭蕉树,让人心情愉快｡房东热情礼貌,非常nice!"},{"_id":"304084577","date":{"$date":"2018-08-08T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16370766","reviewer_id":"188622817","reviewer_name":"Miei","comments":"閑静な住宅街で､ｽｰﾊﾟｰﾏｰｹｯﾄも近くにあり長期滞在に適していました｡\nﾊﾞｽ停も近くですので､移動に便利な場所だと思います｡\nﾋﾞﾘｰさんと奥様は優しく親切にして下さいました｡"},{"_id":"307631575","date":{"$date":"2018-08-14T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16370766","reviewer_id":"198710972","reviewer_name":"冰","comments":"很热情的房东!主动告诉周围的超市､活动场地､商场停车场及开车送我们到租车公司｡热情的女房主还送我们一把自家树上长的香蕉!再次感谢Billy!"},{"_id":"311683411","date":{"$date":"2018-08-21T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16370766","reviewer_id":"169729193","reviewer_name":"Kirk","comments":"it may seem like a typical spot. but really nice clean place.

Would highly recommend this place :)"},{"_id":"221455089","date":{"$date":"2017-12-26T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16381905","reviewer_id":"163314766","reviewer_name":"Hanlyul","comments":"~25min by subway to the main attractions in the City.\n5 min walk to the Yankee Stadium\nThere are two subway stations near this place and for me, that was a big advantage. \nNice room and bathroom, overall good quality."},{"_id":"245031829","date":{"$date":"2018-03-20T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16381905","reviewer_id":"133576219","reviewer_name":"Tasha","comments":"Mr.Charles place is very clean,and he also a very nice man"},{"_id":"250027714","date":{"$date":"2018-04-03T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16381905","reviewer_id":"176598874","reviewer_name":"Joey","comments":"Charles is so nice, and the house is clean.

The bathroom was clean and we had towels provided. Also the apartment is only about a 6 minute walk to the subway station and about a 4 minute walk to target. Charles started off very kind and helpful, offering to give suggestions or tell us things to do and was kind enough to let an extra (unexpected) guest stay with us(she slept on the floor with some blankets). We had discussed paying him some extra money for this extra guest which was fine and we definitely didn’t mind doing that as it was only fair enough, however on the last morning Charles turned nasty and demanded that we pay him the money right that minute, even though I had just explained we were just getting our cases packed etc. It was extremely rude and unnecessary and was very off-putting. Also he accused us of staying after the checkout time which he said was 11am however there was a sign in our room that said checkout was 12pm so we were hardly to blame for that mistake. If you’re wanting somewhere to just sleep that’s only about a 30 minute subway ride to the main attractions in NYC, then this place will be perfect."},{"_id":"315715384","date":{"$date":"2018-08-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16381905","reviewer_id":"11929329","reviewer_name":"Aly","comments":"Charles was nice and quick to respond to our messages.

The apartment is really spacious and comfortable, and is just as pictured. We felt very safe in this neighborhood. And we were very close to everything in Old Montreal. The hosts were super about communicating - they provided plenty of clear instructions up front and were very responsive when we had questions. Their advance instructions also included a lot of area recommendations, and the one recommended restaurant we tried (Olive \u0026 Gourmando) was super. There were minor issues (dishwasher went on the fritz) that did not affect the enjoyment of our stay...stuff like this can happen anywhere. One caveat: if you arrive late (after 11) and park in the lot across the street, you will only be allowed to purchase parking until 5 AM and then will have to return to the lot, at which point you can purchase for a longer stretch (up to 60 hours, as far as I can tell...and we were able to extend after that as well). Everything is very close...you won't need your car."},{"_id":"181883895","date":{"$date":"2017-08-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16389574","reviewer_id":"68324054","reviewer_name":"George","comments":"Close to all Old Montreal sights and close to Metro"},{"_id":"182863722","date":{"$date":"2017-08-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16389574","reviewer_id":"142482752","reviewer_name":"Denise","comments":"Great location, spacious, well-decorated loft, and outstanding responsiveness to a small issue that arose during our stay.

We felt comfortable and at home in their space and totally spoiled by their personalized customer service and unique insight of their city (so much better than staying in a hotel!). They went above and beyond for us and we only stayed a night! \n\nThis \"Vieux- Montreal\" loft is spacious, trendy and bright. It's even better than the photos! Creative design, unique decor and eclectic mod furniture - the ideal space for my work vaca with the hubbie. Their home was spotless and well presented when we arrived. The kitchen was fully stocked with everything we needed including complimentary coffee for the mornings and the lovely scented bathroom toiletries were a nice touch. The queen bed was uber comfy (seriously, where did you buy those sheets?!?). The wifi was fast and reliable (which is always important!), they also provided their Netflixs account and a portable speaker for us to use. \n\nThe location was prime, located on one of the major streets in the Old Port. Surprisingly no noise from the street carried into the apartment. The loft was a quiet and cool escape from the bustling city outside.\n\nTransportation: soo easy! We parked our car in the lot next to the apartment and opted for bixi bikes and the metro.\n\nThe lovely hosts provided amazing recommendations for the entire city (wow) - they're clearly experienced foodies!!! They were always available to answer our (unending stream of) questions, offer helpful suggestions and were just incredible throughout the entire process! The check-in process was made painless with their detailed instruction manual - which was much appreciated after a long day of travel!\n\nCheck- out: Easy but hard to leave!\n\nThanks again for an amazing stay.

Upon arriving we found that old food from the previous guest had been left in the fridge by the cleaning staff. The dish washer was also out of service which was not mentioned in the listing. We purchased food the first day of our trip and stored it in the refrigerator. The next day we noticed the fridge was not cooling properly and were forced to throw out our food. The stove was not heating properly as well.

Highly recommended for your next stay, will make your visit in Montreal exceptional."},{"_id":"234669785","date":{"$date":"2018-02-13T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16389574","reviewer_id":"85492850","reviewer_name":"Marie-Chantal","comments":"Je retournerais volontiers dans cet appartement.

Loved the decor and the open concept.  The pool table was a great addition.  The kids enjoyed playing, while the parents took time to relax after taking all the great local activities.  The loft includes all that you need, plus personal touches to make it feel very inviting. Great location on the boarder of downtown Montreal and Old Montreal. I loved walking out the door onto the street and being in the heart of the town.  The Pub Victoria is a great little local pub that is hopping which is next door.  It has a good, little outdoor patio for a pint.  Location is perfect (although we did not use the bikes their is a convenient bike rental location (bixi) right out front).  The hosts we very quick to respond to inquiries.  They offered all kinds of support including a professionally prepared introduction booklet (outlining house rules and need to know info) and a separate local activities/dinner suggestion booklet. They are very professional hosts who help to reassure you (as this was one of our first AirBnB experiences). They preempt your needs and provide all the required communications upfront opposed to us asking them for info, They already know what info most travellers are looking for. The only thing to note, is upon arrival, the common area which include hallway and stairs are very dated and not inline with the quality of the loft (yet functional) being a very “Old Montreal” building. But once you open the door to the loft, you are relieved). Great experience."},{"_id":"317053721","date":{"$date":"2018-09-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16389574","reviewer_id":"12932526","reviewer_name":"Raquel","comments":"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this loft. It was exactly as pictured and very comfortable and spacious. It was just what we needed traveling with our two children.  All of the required amenities were provided - and then some. We didn’t want for anything.  It was perfect. While we were out sightseeing, the kids would ask when we were going back to the loft. \n\nThe location was great. We were able to walk to all of the areas we wanted to see - Old Montreal, Rue St Catherine, Chinatown, the Port, etc.  This was with no complaints from the kids - a true sign that it was a comfortable walk. When we wanted to venture further out, the Metro was a quick couple of blocks away. \n\nAside from place and location, the best part about this rental was our hosts. They were very helpful from the initial booking, responded quickly to any and all questions and were very detailed in their communication. Everything was as they described. Most importantly, they were very gracious. Even when we had a small mishap, they made us feel very much at ease. We have used many vacation home rentals and found our hosts for this unit to be one of the bests. \nWe highly recommend!"},{"_id":"318259332","date":{"$date":"2018-09-03T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16389574","reviewer_id":"112279451","reviewer_name":"Gabriel","comments":"We had a great stay at this loft.

The instructions on how to find the condo is very detailed and straight forward (only suggestion is to add the floor# on the instructions).

There's plenty of shops \u0026 restaurants around \u0026 a McDonalds directly across the street. The buses pull up right out the front \u0026 the shuttle to the outlets is a 1 min walk. The only issue we had was the lockbox wasn't set to our code when we checked in but Maki fixed that immediately \u0026 the cleaners gave us the keys so there was no issue. The beds were comfortable \u0026 the space was great! The only slight downside for some is that there's no air on in the bedroom, only in the living room. I personally didn't mind this as there were fans, but my friend was a little hot on one occasion. The view is nice of the mountains \u0026 the condo is on the 20th floor. I will 100% be returning as you can't get a better place \u0026 location for the price.

If you're planning to use the space to relax and rest a lot then I would say it will comfortably fit 4 people.
