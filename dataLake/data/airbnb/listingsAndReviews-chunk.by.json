The response was quick which was great. \n\nThe location of the apartment is great, making it easy to walk everywhere, with plenty of shops, cafes and restaurants. It is also very close to the Sao Bento metro station. \n\nThe apartment itself is minimalistic and spacious, and can comfortably sleep 6 people. \\\nRegarding amenities, there is no washing machine and you will need to bring your own tea and coffee etc. ( bedding, towels, toilet paper, kitchen utensils are provided for)\n\nWe had a situation with the building maintenance, which is out of the control of the apartment owner, however feel, that it could have been better managed and communicated.\n\nUpon checking in, we were notified that the building was having a problem with a water leak, and maintenance would need to come and fix the pipes the next morning for a few hours. The owner assured us, this will be quick and of the least disturbance. For the inconvenience of not being able to use the kitchen sink and the disturbance caused, complementary parking was offered. We were totally fine with this. \n\nWhen we used the main entrance that evening, the lobby ceiling was dripping with water, through the ceiling light sockets, and all over the floor. We notified the owners immediately. With no response that evening.\n\nThe next morning maintenance took longer then anticipated and felt like a full on construction site due to the drilling. The owners apologised and assured us not to worry., and that further compensations would be made. We left before they had finished. Upon returning, the kitchen was dusty and dirty, we texted the owner and they gave us the option to check out and they would refund the 2nd night or stay with further compensation to be discussed.  Due to the lack of time, we decided to stay.\n\nWith the check out, we would just leave with the keys in the apartment. However, we did not have any form of communication from the owners, so decided to call (international calls that we had to pay) to see what further compensations could be made. After a few calls and a bit of back and forth, the owners agreed to compensate 25% of the accommodation. They were immediate in the action which we appreciate. "},{"_id":"42398999","date":{"$date":"2015-08-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6667210","reviewer_id":"15336817","reviewer_name":"Federico","comments":"Magnifique \nLocation parfaite"},{"_id":"52050212","date":{"$date":"2015-10-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6667210","reviewer_id":"20797155","reviewer_name":"William","comments":"Great location, super nice apartment, friendly hosts"},{"_id":"60290298","date":{"$date":"2016-01-21T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6667210","reviewer_id":"14811816","reviewer_name":"Maureen","comments":"Great location.

At closer inspection you’ll find small cafes, bars, shops and restaurants at every corner. Soon you will make friends with the owners. People are super friendly here and will make you feel at home right away. In addition to the corner store across the street, find a string of larger food stores on nearby Fulton Street, which is five short blocks (ca. five minute walk) away. Choices include Met Supermarket, Mr.Melon for fresh produce, Green Planet, our local health food store, and Brooklyn Victory Garden, a bright neighborhood cafe and purveyor of delicious \"locavore\" fare.","notes":"Includes: all utilities air conditioning tableware \u0026 cookware iron \u0026 ironing board hairdryer flat screen TV with HD cable high speed internet via wifi","transit":"We are between the Franklin Avenue and the Clinton/Washington Ave C-train stations and near the Classon Ave G-train station. Take the C train (connects to the express A train) and be in Manhattan in about 20 minutes. The G train will take you to Park Slope or Williamsburg in about the same time. Several buses come to our neighborhood as well. Street parking is free and very easy to find. Only on Sunday mornings, parking spots may be in moderate supply, because there is a church across the street and many people drive to services. Please observe opposite side of the street cleaning rules. This means that for about two hours twice a week, you can only park on one side of the street.","access":"","interaction":"You can call me any time if you need anything.

Parking was an amazing benefit of this place. The parking is underground in the same building and very secure (did not worry about the car what so ever). The location of the place is right by the port and a very close walk to all the nice attractions (depending on the attraction it was 5-20mins walk). Jonathan welcomed us with a bottle of champagne and a loaf of fresh French bread (which we ended up using to make one of our dinners, we made sandwiches). The condo is exactly like the pictures show (the wifi was easy to connect to, there is cable on the tv or we connected our tablet with a HDMI cable). The condo was very clean and well furnished.

The first one since we repeatedly use Airbnb's services since 2013 (as host AND guests)\r\nWhere to start?\r\n\r\n1 st night, awaken at 5am by his brother listening to music on his tablet at full blast. We had to discuss with him to make him realise it was slightly too loud...\r\n\r\n2nd night, the TV in the living room was very loud and we asked Jesus to at least reduce the sound so our room doesn't feel like a home cinema. All of this was around 2am.\r\n\r\n3rd night, exact same thing with the TV.\r\nJesus barely accepted to slightly reduce the sound but said it was the maximum he could do and that it wasn't his problem if we couldn't sleep as we had to adapt to his lifestyle. When we mentioned that we are paying for a service which is non existent he just couldn't care less and ignored this argument. \r\nAfter this incident, he accused us of lacking of respect in front of his guests by continuously shouting at him. What???!\r\n\r\nBy the way, you have to know that the room is located between his brother's and the living room that Jesus uses as his bedroom in the meantime. Not to mention that the walls are almost made of paper and also that we were wearing earplugs throughout the stay.\r\n\r\nWe had so much better experiences where we used CouchSurfing, unbelievebale.\r\nWe were supposed to stay 5 nights but after unsuccessfully trying to find a solution we decided to leave because we just couldn't sleep at all.\r\nHopefully this review will prevent anyobdy else from booking with him!"},{"_id":"111084694","date":{"$date":"2016-10-30T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6685814","reviewer_id":"52667018","reviewer_name":"Roman","comments":"Tout était nickel chez Jesus.

During our stay, I messaged her a couple of times and never heard back from. I messaged her regarding the dirty swimming gear, roaches, dirty pots/pan, and dirty kitchen utensils. While there wasn't anything she could've done for us immediately, she never even acknowledged that I messaged her. The roaches were in the kitchen (in the cabinets, on the stove top, countertop, floor, bathroom sink counter, curtain in the living room, living room floor). The only communication we've had since I booked her place was when I requested and received a refund for the cleaning fee, which is $135, because there were several roaches in the kitchen and in the living room. I actually asked her about the cleaning fee before booking with her because it is unusually high compared to several other listings in the area, but she stated that her cleaning fee is that price because she gets her place professionally cleaned. There were old candy pieces underneath the single sofa she has in her living room, which is probably a source of the roaches. I sent her photos and also took videos of the swimming gear, pots/pans, roaches, etc. Half of the swimming gear that's \"provided\" is broken and we ended up having to rent gear because the ones that were intact didn't fit us. We thought we'd be saving money by getting a place that provided these amenities. The cooler that she provides was sandy all over and had a dead roach inside of it. She charges you for every little thing (one example is using AC more than what's considered \"usual\" for her guests) - it's all in the welcome binder. You have to do a load of dishes in the dishwasher before leaving if you want to prevent additional charges, even though nothing was cleaned for us before we arrived. While the bed is very comfortable and bathroom looks nice in person, is not worth the lack of cleanliness and thought that you'll have to deal with roaches when you come back to the apartment every night (especially finding multiple in the kitchen everywhere). The residential community is in a good, central location. However, I would definitely not recommend this place to any of my friends or family!"},{"_id":"112054456","date":{"$date":"2016-11-03T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6767563","reviewer_id":"92720259","reviewer_name":"Scott","comments":"Rebecca's place was very nice, clean and extremely close to the beach (you can't beat that).

We had no trouble entering the place. We had a short walk to the beach! That was awesome! In addition, we had some terribly windy days while there, so it was nice to relax by the pool and use the hot tub that were right next to our condo building. \n\nThere were a few screens with holes that she quickly had fixed while we were there. It was great having a washer and dryer available as well as the dishwasher. Everything worked great and we were very happy with the stay. \n\nThe only issue we had while staying there was not knowing where to park when someone parked in our reserved spot. We ended up parking in guest and letting the security guard know so our rental wouldn't be towed.  Otherwise, we had no issues during our stay. Some of the snorkel gear was broken upon arrival, but my sister was able to put together two complete sets. That was plenty for us as we would take turns when people were tired. We got to swim with sea turtles two of the days we were there, once at the beach right across the street from our condo and once at a beach north of Lahaina. \n\nI highly recommend this property. We did see some public transportation buses running, but we didn't use them since we had a rental van. So I don't know if it is reliable or not. Mahalo, Rebecca and Veronika for a fabulous stay!"},{"_id":"171745101","date":{"$date":"2017-07-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6767563","reviewer_id":"110080010","reviewer_name":"Ed","comments":"Directions were very clear and simple to follow.

It’s close to lots of restaurants and the beach across the street, Charley Young Beach, is my favorite for late afternoon swimming and watching the sunset. The beach gear was fantastic. Used the snorkeling gear, boogie boards, beach chairs and beacb umbrella to go snorkeling at Ulua beach one day and had the best time. It has a fully equipped kitchen, where we enjoyed cooking full meals for our family. Foodland was also just 4 minutes away drive. The only blip for us, and it’s not really anything that the owner can do, is that the beds run soft. So if you like harder mattresses, you might need to make some adjustments like putting a pillow under your lower back. Thank you for having us!!!

It’s close to the beach. The pool is great. The only gripe I have is that from the initial advertised price of 296$ per night after service fee, cleaning fee and Hawaii tax it was closer to 381$ per night. The Hawaii state tax is mentioned in the deal but easy to oversee because it is not due until 2 weeks prior to arrival when it is too late to dispute.   It is 14.25% so it added about 44$ per night for us."},{"_id":"404368290","date":{"$date":"2019-01-23T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6767563","reviewer_id":"129810504","reviewer_name":"Lisa","comments":"Rebecca’s place was great in general! The location was good and parking was near the entrance. However, we did see a cockroach in the bathroom (yikes) and we were only provided two very small sets of body wash, shampoo, and conditioner for 4 people for 3 nights stay. We used that up the first night so we had to go buy our own. The kitchen is also good but didnt have any hood so the place was filled with smoke after cooking a meal. Lastly, the place had sand here and there on the floor from the previous guests, which we didnt really mind but it also had sand in the washing machine and the dryer which wasnt pleasant. I did tell Rebecca about the sand and she promptly sent housekeeping to clean, but there wasnt much she could do since the sand was already part of the washing machine and the dryer."},{"_id":"404921821","date":{"$date":"2019-01-25T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6767563","reviewer_id":"27737372","reviewer_name":"Sydney","comments":"Perfect launching pad near gorgeous beach.

If you get a chance to rent the entire house, go for it. We stayed in the front two rooms of the house, in our own fairly separate area, and had sole use of a beautiful, spacious bathroom.  There are no kitchen facilities in this part of the house (as made clear in the ad) but there is a small fridge, kettle and toaster, as well as cutlery and crockery for guests to use. Meals are easy to find in any case as the house is close to some fantastic cafes, bars, pubs and restaurants – a real taste of Sydney’s cosmopolitan inner west. The house is in a peaceful, quiet, tree-lined street. Parking, if you need it, is easy to find nearby, or even out the front if you're lucky (check the parking signs to be sure though). Public transport – buses, trains –  in easy walking distance. Carole and Steve and Snoop dog were perfect AirBnB hosts, very friendly and considerate, without being intrusive. We were lucky to have found them! Absolutely recommended.

The perfect place to stay when in Sydney! The check in was smooth and Steve was very helpful and friendly! We were also allowed to leave our bags in the house while we explore Sydney on our last day and pick it up just before our evening flight. Location is great!! Located near Newtown which is a very nice and cool place to explore. It is also located very near to a bus and train that leads you straight to anywhere you would like to explore in Sydney. The house is also such a treat to return to after a long busy day out. You will have a nice big bed to sleep in and a big bathroom all to yourself. Additionally, there is also a lounge that we were allowed to use all to ourself to make coffee or tea. Overall, very thankful to Steve and Carole and will definetely be back here if ever in Sydney :)"}]}

The windows overlook the street, which is lined with restaurants of worldly cuisine - Italian, Brazilian, Korean, Japanese, Chinese, Thai and more. Because of this, it can be a bit noisy at night, so if you're a light sleeper, best to wear earplugs. The location is perfect and it's walking distance (5-20 minutes) to touristy parts of NYC (central park, theatre district, times square, Carlo's Bake Shop - their cannolis are my weakness).

The owners were very attentive and informative to our needs during our 2 night stay. This location is PERFECT to say the least. Public transportation is near in addition to various shops, restaurants, and TIMES SQUARE itself. Building is very secure and the \"cleaning lady\" is very very very nice and thorough with what she does. We had a late flight out but were able to leave our bags locked in the hallway-this factor made the end of the trip so worth it as I didn't want to haul luggage around all day. The noise(just a few horns and voices as people passed by)is easy to not hear and be able to enjoy a nice sleep. You do have to go to 3rd floor to iron, but I honestly felt like I was in my own home upstairs. Not lots of traffic in building either.

The kitchen is in a shared area, but it's very clean and there is a fridge that you can use to keep your food. There was a portable AC near the window that made summer nights a lot more bearable. We especially liked the key code system, it made checking in a lot easier as we didn't have to coordinate for a time to meet and pass the keys.\r\n\r\nThe place was super convenient and close to everything. There were tons of restaurants around. Subway station was 5-10 min away by foot and Times Square was only 2 blocks away. There was also a big grocery store close by that was open until 1am.\r\n\r\nDue to its location in midtown Manhattan, there was some noise outside the apartment. I could hear drunk people and trucks honking in the middle of the night, so consider bringing earplugs if you are a light sleeper.

Was told that there were access codes to the building and room that I would be given 5-7 days before I arrive. About two weeks before our stay I saw that Janice had taken over the page. Messages her 5 days before asking for access codes, got no reply. Kept doing it every day with no reply, and the day before very few hours, still with no reply. Landed in NYC and booked a hotel, but decided to give her the benefit of the doubt since our hotel was only a block away. Went to the building, knocked on the door- no answer. Stood there for 15 minutes and repeated but still same result. We left and went to our hotel.\n\nLong story short, paid for an Airbnb we didn't get to stay in due to an unresponsive host. We got a refund, but I'm saying this just to warn all future people who may inquire about booking through Janice. Go somewhere else and save yourself some trouble.

The wifi also worked perfectly. \n\nCons: Hosts are lagged behind in responding to our messages. When we arrived, we immediately noticed the bed sheets were dirty and unchanged since we found several hairs (lighter than mine or my mom's) at the end of the bed, not on the pillow, but in side the blanket and AT THE END OF THE BED. This is unacceptable and made us really uncomfortable so we contacted the hosts immediately around 9pm. However, they didn't respond nor send anyone to change the sheets for us. Luckily, we ran into this cleaning lady the next morning and she was really nice and changed our bed sheets, pillow cases and even added another blanket for us. Till this point, the hosts still had not replied. \n\nThere wasn't a hand wash or soap in the bathroom which we thought was really weird. Who's gonna pack a hand soap with them when they are doing airbnb (???). For the kitchen, just FYI, there wasn't a microwave.... a microwave! So for all the peeps who gonna have leftover food and need to put in the fridge (they sure do have that thank god), pizza, soup, rice, or any stir-fried dishes are not good choices. Unless you don't mind reheating everything on the stove. \n\nLastly, the bathroom doorknob was broken. Whenever I tried to open the door from the inside, the knob would come off. I saw someone commenting about this but I'm not sure if it was the same room. It wasn't a big deal since none of us locked ourselves inside...but something to keep in mind, especially for people really value their travel experiences and living conditions. \n\nIn general, it's a convenient place for people who just need a room to stay. I started to speculate there is a company or group of people running this business. They have cleaning ladies  (not just one), just like hotels. This whole building has several rooms inside and no oven or microwave in the kitchen. Therefore the hosts are probably just there as a public figure to put on their profile but they don't actually live here. I was looking for a more interactive and personal experience so I was a little bit disappointed.

The room was the perfect temperature (space heater was on when we arrived). Everything was also very clean. It was nice having a private bathroom en-suite. Check in time was at 3pm, however, we did request an earlier check in time due to other obligations, and we were actually able to get in even earlier than that which was great. I normally stay in The Village, however, if I were to stay in this area again, I would definitely stay with Yasu and Akiko again."},{"_id":"365734199","date":{"$date":"2019-01-01T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6795568","reviewer_id":"152701353","reviewer_name":"Luca Giacomo","comments":"L’alloggio è molto bello, cucina sempre pulita e disponibile, camera spaziosa e bagno con una grande doccia.

The kitchen on the second floor was readily available for use, and it was always nice to see friendly guests passing by.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that struck us oddly (not in a bad way), was the fact that there was cleaning personnel on location. Therefore, the apartment felt more like a hotel than an apartment.  I guess the cleaning lady cleans your room everyday unless you inform her not to.  \r\n\r\nA random and weird experience we had one day was when we got back to our room and there were people (workers) in our bathroom changing out the towel rack.

We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the beds (especially the mattresses), the huge steam shower, the generous supply of fresh towels, and the well-sized closet with plenty of hangers and a drawer cart for keeping our things neat and tidy.  As it was chilly when we were in NYC, being able to adjust the temperature of our own room was also a huge plus.  Another perk was that the apartment was on a street just lined with restaurants (we tried Dim Sum Palace and it did not disappoint), and around the corner was a cute cafe called Amy's Bread.  Getting to and from the place was easy via the subway - Yasu \u0026 Akiko provided very detailed directions, not to mention very thorough instructions regarding check-in/out and house rules.  They were also great in responding quickly to questions.  It was a short but such a comfortable stay for us, we wouldn't hesitate to book this place again and highly recommend it.

Great connection to Metro, Tram, major pedestrian street (3 min walk) but still very calm and tucked away, protected from the 'Istanbul chaos' on the streets. Hi, my name is Jonas, an architect living in Istanbul for a bit more than three years now and I would like to offer you my house, so you can discover this interesting city on your own. The apartment is a nicely renovated and furnished with a very warm atmosphere through its historic structure, all the wood and bricks and not least the small individually designed details.  There is a master bedroom with a king size bed and a small balcony, a marble bathroom with large rain shower and a small kitchen, but the heart is its large, cozy living room, that can be joined in the day time and be separated with sliding doors and the sofa turns into a very comfortable double bed. The dining room offers comfy seating a  a large table that can easily hold up to 8 people. But ","neighborhood_overview":"The flat is located in Beyoglu - the cultural, musical and artistic center of the city. You can enjoy nice food in restaurants with a breathtaking view, overlooking the Bosporus, go out to the various bars or just stroll up the vibrant Istiklal Caddesi.","notes":"If there is anything that you would like to know about, please ask!","transit":"It takes you 5 minutes to the Sishane Metro Station and the Tophane Tram Stop. From there you can get straight to the historic peninsula and sense the ottoman and byzantine Istanbul, with Hagia Sofia, the Blue Mosque, the Cisterns and the Grand Bazar, of course – to name just a few. The ferry station is in a 10 minute walking distance, so your trip to the Asian side of Istanbul is just a hop away. Galata is just in front of the door step, with all its small galleries and designer shops and Karaköy is just a stone's throw away from the apartment, inviting with all it's hip cafes, bars restaurants. Or enjoy the modern Istanbul in the Asmalimascit/Tünel district with all its bars, pubs, clubs, restaurants, with crowded streets and music everywhere (also less than 5 minutes walking)  But, don't worry - the apartment’s street is really quiet and peaceful.","access":"The house is fully equipped: TV, WiFi, laundry machine, tumble dryer, dish washer, stove and oven, kettle, toast machine and a nice big fridge. There is Central heating, warm water 24/7 and Air Conditioning and ceiling fans help in the hot Istanbul summer to keep the place cool and comfortable.  Of course I will provide you the linen and towels. And if you have any special requests, just let me know.","interaction":"Furthermore, I can also organize an airport pick up service for you, that brings you straight to the apartment, if you wish so. If you're interested I can arrange yoga classes, massages or hamam visits for you. Just let me know!","house_rules":"Common sense.  I believe that all my guests treat my place as it was their own.

We very much appreciated the warm welcome although our flight was delayed. \n\nAccommodation: It was definitely one of the most unique apartments I have ever stayed at. You will truly feel like living an architect's pad. We could see every design detail that Jonas put into place, from the power outlets to the wall arts. The apartment was spacious, clean, safe, private and well equipped. Both bed and sofa bed were very comfortable. Oh, the bathroom is truly equipped with five star hotel facilities as written in the description. We also loved the marble staircase. \n\nLocation: Unbeatable! We were walking distance from some of the most restaurants in Istanbul such as 360 Bar, Yeni Lokanta, Cecconi's, Leb-I-Derya, and Mikla etc. The apartment is steps away from the most popular pedestrian street in Istanbul, in the heart of the hip Beyoglu neighborhood where you will find Istanbul Modern museum (loved it there), Galata Tower, and a very well known Hamam called Kilic Ali Pasa Hamani, all of which are walkable from the apartment. To visit the historical Istanbul for Blue Mosque, Topkapi Palace, and world famous Hagia Sophia, the tram is just down the hill from the apartment. But we walked everywhere! \n\nThank you Jonas. We really enjoyed Istanbul part of it thanks to having a comfortable and cozy place to rest. \n\n\n"},{"_id":"51704195","date":{"$date":"2015-10-24T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6807419","reviewer_id":"24587906","reviewer_name":"Molly","comments":"My experience with my temporary home in Istanbul is reminiscent of one fortuitous occasion on which I was accidentally allotted a first class seat on an international flight.  The accommodations were luxurious; the ambience a careful balance between stimulating and restful, the service superior in both attentiveness and cordiality; I had no trouble acclimating.  I like nice things.\r\n\r\nI arrived on a Friday evening and after he gave directions in Turkish to my taxi driver over the phone, Jonas, the gracious host-turned-bellhop, pulled my generously portioned luggage out of my taxi, hauled it up the stairs for me, and showed me into a beautifully refinished apartment. . . with a plethora of snacks.  Regrettably, I ate all of them, and for that I do not thank him, but there was a degree of thoughtfulness in this welcoming which may or may not be demonstrated by one's own family upon homecoming so I believe it merits recognition.\r\n\r\nThe digs: significantly more spacious than expected (or needed, but I'm not one to complain about such things), brick covered walls, hardwood floors, brand new appliances, full length gold framed mirror in the ample bedroom evoking a Victorian-era level of refinement . . .  in summary, Jonas should be charging more.  But I will stop here.\r\n\r\nI lied.  One more note.  The bathroom.  I grew up with three brothers who pounded on the door if I had the audacity to take more than 23 seconds in our small bathroom which they never cleaned.  So now, as previously mentioned, I like nice things, including a nice bathroom; I like to have coffee when doing my makeup in the mirror in the morning and red wine in front of said mirror when getting ready to go out at night, and this is the bathroom for such things.  It is a marble/glass/stainless steel oasis equipped with a well lit vanity mirror, removable shower head, and high powered hairdryer (#basic but these things do matter; hostel hair dryers do not cut it and even some nice hotel hair dryers will keep you drying for days.)\r\n\r\nNow that we've covered the critical points and know my hair looked good for my entire trip, I should say a few words about Istanbul.  Hearing the call to prayer throughout the day and seeing the mosques dotting the skyline makes it quite the surreal city.  Though as exotic as it was, I actually felt quite at home rather quickly.  Everyone was respectful and friendly towards me, I was able to walk everywhere I wanted to go, and consequently I found it easy to slip into life here.  Jonas gallantly offered to escort me to and from the apartment at night should I ever feel uncomfortable, but I never needed to take him up on the offer.  I have traveled all over Europe and this was the safest I have ever felt in any neighborhood I've stayed in.\r\n\r\nIn case it was not clear, I will be back.

We stayed here for a month and were overall satisfied with our stay. We had to get a few things for the kitchen (like a pot to make pasta, a sieve, etc.) since we wanted to cook at least a few days a week. This wasn’t really a problem. The main issue was that the fan in the TV room wasn’t working when we arrived and the last 10 days of our stay it got pretty hot in Istanbul. I asked about fans/air conditioner before we booked the place specifically, because my husband has low tolerance for heat, so we were disappointed to find out that the fan was not working (all other fans and the air conditioner in the bedroom worked well). We were watching the World Cup, so we spent quite a bit of time in that room. Jonas was already aware of the problem when I brought it up with him and told us that there was an issue with its engine and that he bought the fans from France and couldn’t find a matching model in Turkey to replace the broken one. He offered to send one from France, but of course the chances of the fan making it to Turkey before we left was very low. We were expecting a more immediate solution—such as an inexpensive portable fan from a local store perhaps? Luckily, I have family living in Istanbul, so we borrowed a portable fan from my sister; otherwise we wouldn’t be able to use that room very much. Jonas was prompt in his replies when we had questions and he let us stay an extra night without charging us.

It is located nearby the city center, Aliados was a 10 min walk away, going back wasn't so easy though, let's say that Porto is not a very flat city haha\r\n\r\nA big plus was the bakery downstairs, we're big fans of the pastel de nata and the ones they had were amazing!"},{"_id":"37375761","date":{"$date":"2015-07-06T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6836536","reviewer_id":"36139175","reviewer_name":"Maria","comments":"We had a wonderful family trip to Porto. The city is very live, with beautiful sights, wonderful restaurants, and many things to do. We enjoyed staying at Cristina's apartment because its very cozy, full of warmth, and with all the spaces we needed. It has a full equipped kitchen where we could have breakfast every morning, and besides there is a bakery downstairs on the same street and grocery stores. There is also a metro station nearby, but you can get to places of interest in a 10 minute walk.  Cristina was very kind and helpful, a very good hostess.

På den største altan er der eftermiddags/aftensol, hvilket var fantastisk da vi var der i oktober.\r\nVores vært - Cristina - var fantastisk. selv om vi aldrig nåede at møde hende, hjalp hun os utallige gange. Vi behøvede bare at ringe eller skrive til hende, så havde vi svar næsten med det samme. Der er masser af små hyggelige og lokale butikker og restauranter - bade på vejen og i området. Der ligger et godt privathospital nede af vejen, som er godt og effektivt. Busforbindelsen til centrum er god og let at bruge. Det tager omkring 15 min at gå ind til centrum.

She was easy to communicate with and was very responsive, both before our visit and while we were staying with her. The apartment is smaller than it looks in the pictures. We were 5 adults and a small child, and even though there were enough beds, there really wasn't enough space. The apartment is located on a main street so there was a lot of traffic noise at night which was difficult because we couldn't sleep with the windows open and we were there during a heat wave. There is no air conditioning but Cristina purchased fans for us that helped. It is a long walk to the historic district and river but coming back up is a steep hill so it is possible to walk into town (it is far) but will likely need a taxi back up. Same for a grocery store. There is a lovely bakery very close for breakfast and coffee. The apartment was very clean and had everything that we needed.

La zona no estaba del todo mal, pero en los alrederores no encuentras nada aunque esta a 15 minutos caminando del centro y no esta mal."},{"_id":"349092481","date":{"$date":"2018-11-16T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6836536","reviewer_id":"41145430","reviewer_name":"Edyta","comments":"Cristina jest bardzo gościnna.

We were able to easily walk to St Marks and other spots in the LES within 10-15 minutes. I found the area to be very nice and the room to be clean- but my mother (who is used to overpaying for a room at the Hilton) found the area a bit dark and the room/bathroom not quite as clean as she would have hoped. This feedback is of course relative- as someone who has stayed at Airbnbs and hostels around the world, I found the space very comfortable and reasonably priced for NYC. I would definitely recommend staying with Ben for anyone who is comfortable staying in a lived-in apartment and walking a block or two through less busy streets."}]}

Everything is so near plus convenient to get and find from local delicacy to fast food, from boutique to shopping mall likes Times Squares, Sogo, Lee Gardens and etc.\r\n\r\nOn top of the location are good, her apartment is great. It is very cozy, clean and comfortable. It is fully and well equipped with all the necessity you will need. You can even cook and wash your clothes. It is very nicely renovated. Although there are 6 of us but it is alright as the place is not too small and we can bond even more. Choosing and staying at Carmen's apartment indeed is a right choice for us as the experience gain is awesome. This is not the first time for me staying and visiting Hong Kong but the first time that I felt like a Hong Kong resident staying in Hong Kong. The feeling is very different from staying in hotel.\r\n\r\nBeside the great location and cozy apartment, our host Carmen is awesome. She is lovely, sweet, kind, extremely helpful and extremely friendly. She goes all out to make us comfortable like getting the apartment ready before we even arrived like turn the light on and turn on the air condition, prepared all kind of beverages for us in the fridge plus she even prepared coffee and tea in-case we want to make hot drinks instead. She even waited for us at the arrival to welcome us.\r\n\r\nThe overall is great and awesome. I will definitely stay in Carmen's apartment again for our next visit to Hong Kong.\r\n\r\n"},{"_id":"2777015","date":{"$date":"2012-11-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"685373","reviewer_id":"3262331","reviewer_name":"Ann","comments":"Carmen's apartment was everything we expected from the desciption on Airbnb.

I was pleasantly surprised. For this particular unit, whilst the building itself is not exactly pretty, the flat itself was in an extremely convenient location on HK Island and was well kept inside. We used it as a base for 4 nights (3 days) and it was perfect for us as a family of 2 adults and 2 children (14 \u0026 11). We were out most of the day and only used it to collapse at the end of it. It was good to come back to a place where you can get yourself a snack/drink without paying the world for it like you do in hotels. There were no English speaking channels on the TV but the DVD player seems like a good idea even though we did not use it. There are two windows in the apartment (one in each of the bedrooms) that look straight into a fairly ordinary set of units/lane way and hence not noted in the pictures on the website.\r\n\r\nOver all a really nice, clean and comfortable enough unit to base yourself in for a few days in HKG if you do not want to pay the expensive rates of a hotel. Carmen was a wonderful contact, very generous with her information. easy to communicate with and organised a transfer to the airport on our behalf. Her unit was well equipped.\r\n\r\nWe would definitely use this unit again for our travels in HKG."},{"_id":"3030510","date":{"$date":"2012-12-05T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"685373","reviewer_id":"3562981","reviewer_name":"Alvin","comments":"Carmen and Eric (Carmen's husband) are fantastic hosts.

But if you are like us who went out all day and went back only at night to sleep, it didn't really matter. Carmen was very helpful and a wonderful host. From her tips that she sent via mail to arranging our pickup for airport transfers, greeting us when we arrived at her apt., to accommodating requests for a rice cooker, everything was handled beautifully. The beds and sofa bed were comfy and we had good rests. It was really helpful that the elevator is at the ground floor without having to go up a few steps up (some apt we saw from the outside was like that). Place was very convenient and close to the Causeway Bay MTR. Note: if you have problems going up/down steps, take the only elevator at Sogo exit.

Typical Hong Kong size so don't expect it to be super spacious. We didn't get to meet the host, Carmen as she was away during our stay. We were provided with self-check-in instructions which were quite easy. She also messaged us to check if we were ok and told us to contact her if we had any issues.\r\n\r\nAs it was the first time my one year old baby travelled, we were quite anxious if he were to like the flight or the stay. Turns out its not that bad! Had requested Carmen to provide a pail so that we can bathe the little one but Carmen was so nice she provided a big baby bath which we were really grateful for.\r\n\r\nShower was good, as heater is provided with relatively good pump you would have no issues such as cold trickling water. Washing machine is functional, washing powder is provided too so no worries if you want to do some washing. Cooking utensils were also adequate, we brought a small pot and were able to cook baby's meals using everything provided including the induction cooker and the utensils.\r\n\r\nIt is on the second floor but you cant hear much noise from the streets.\r\n\r\nTheres a great tv in the living area with channels and DVDs provided.

Her cute little apartment had everything we could need during our 4 day stay - so much attention to detail and caring for her guests. From a rice cooker and water kettle to a set of umbrellas, it all saved us plenty of time, effort and money! We could make ourselves breakfast and even a light dinner on a couple nights, thanks to all her kitchen supplies.\n\nWe didn't get to meet Carmen but all her instructions were super accurate and we didn't lose our way at any point. The door lock system was so convenient. We used bus A11 to get to her place from the airport. I suggest it to anyone who's thinking of taking public transport. It couldn't be easier. For all the sightseeing, we used the Causeway Bay MTR station as our starting and end point. Again, very easy and short walk from Carmen's place. We bought an octopus card as per her suggestion, which made things much faster and easier as well. \n\nIf we ever go back to Hong Kong, we'll definitely consider this place again. It had a solution for all our needs. Please don't be intimidated by the small size of the apartment. It is very efficient and well organized and the sleep quality is great!\n\nCarmen is very responsive and throughout our trip, I was able to ask her questions and she would answer within a few mins. \n\nThank you so much for the wonderful stay in Hong Kong!

Carmen was not in HK during my staying period, but it doesnt bother. Carmen almost answer my question/providing her help immediately whenever i ask. For example, on the second day i told Carmen the detergent was depleted ,she asked her friend put the detergent in front of the door without interrupting me(it was 11pm that time). Only one thing need to be improve, the water heater, it's not stable. It could only provide very limited hot water even if i already pre-heat 25mins before using.

Carlos was very responsive to my initial inquiry and to all subsequent inquiries about the house.\r\n\r\nAlthough Carlos was out of town, he arranged for Vitor to be available to us during the rental.  Vitor was very helpful.  We had to open some locked windows and Vitor came within an hour to fix the problem.  Also, we had a hot water issue, but again Vitor was at the house and fixed the problem immediately (so fast I didn't have a chance to read his response email - he arrived before it did!).  These issues happen and the most important thing is to get them fixed as quickly as possible.  I was impressed with the level of responsiveness.\r\n\r\nThe house is well designed and charming.  The pictures are accurate - the house is beautiful.  The beds are very comfortable.  We used all the appliances and all worked.  There are plenty of pots and pans and sufficient dishes, glasses and cutlery.  We bought fish at the Bolhao market and had a great dinner at home one night in the dining room that we cooked in the kitchen of the house. The internet was also fine.\r\n\r\nThe host supplied a decent baby bed and a very good high chair for the baby.  The house was very clean upon arrival.  The locks work well, but are tricky for North Americans.  Be sure to try them with the host present.\r\n\r\nIt isn't clear from the pictures or description, but there are multiple levels to the house all reached via a spiral staircase in the middle.  There is one double bedroom on the ground floor that has its own 2 piece bathroom.  People using this room have to go upstairs to someone else's bathroom to bathe or shower.  (The other two bedrooms have beautiful ensuite full bathrooms). This was not a problem for us at all.  There is also one other 1/2 bathroom in the house.\r\n\r\nThis house is in a very residential neighbourhood but in the old part of town.  It's about a 10 minute walk to the restaurants along the riverside.  We walked to the port houses from here - about 20 minutes walk with a great view of the river the whole way (and we were pushing a stroller).  There are a couple of good neighbourhood cafes very close by and a small grocery store a few metres away where we could buy meat, cheese, wine, milk etc. - limited selection, but all the necessities are available.  The location is reasonably quiet at night too.  It's a good location to be in to feel as if you are living like a local but close enough to walk to the main sights or catch a bus if necessary.  The tram to the beach at Foz do Douro stops nearby as well.\r\n\r\nI would stay here again."},{"_id":"38316529","date":{"$date":"2015-07-14T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6868273","reviewer_id":"21307293","reviewer_name":"Marcus","comments":"Carlos was super friendly and helpful.

Espaçosa, acomoda seis pessoas com bastante conforto. Minha única consideração: o quarto voltado para a rua é bem barulhento. Se vc tem o sono leve, opte por um dos outros dois quartos ou leve protetores de ouvido. Além dos carros, bondinho e ônibus, o bar que fica na esquina da frente abre cedinho e se ouve tudo...

Bien qu'il y ait 3 chambre - 3 lits double, la maison n'est agréable que pour 4 personnes. La literie de la chambre au rez de chaussé est veille, le matelas peu confortable et il n'y a pas de salle de bain. Il faut donc passer par une des deux autres chambres pour accéder à une salle de bain. Aux petites heures du matin il faut s'attendre à avoir un peu de bruit (tram, poubelles, personnes qui parlent dans les rues,...) mais je pense que tous les appartements à Porto sont les mêmes sur ce point !"},{"_id":"96099050","date":{"$date":"2016-08-21T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6868273","reviewer_id":"4438030","reviewer_name":"Nicolas","comments":"Great house in a remote location but close to everything! \nWelcome was great and we enjoyed all the amenities!\nDon't forget to try the restaurant just next to the house that is great value for the quality!\nNote that the house has lots of stairs and might not be suited for those who would have difficulties climbing and going down stairs.

She also provided us with a contact by (Hidden by Airbnb) for taxis, which was really convenient, to enable us to get our bearings. The house was beautiful, better than we could have imagined. We were 4 ladies who have been friends for nearly 40 years, and just loved the whole Porto experience. Would highly recommend Porto, and also The Ivy House. The Portugese people we met in every situation, were so friendly, and helpful. The position of The Ivy House  for us was great, it was on the tram line,bus line and the Red and Yellow tourist bus line, worthwhile using. We had the best time ever.

Also the little restaurants close to house were very nice, good food and drinks and very good prices. Being in the ivy house means to be in the centre of the lovely Porto.

Backsons is a great restaurant close by and the casual corner establishment which is practically under the house is just great - the lady who owns it is so friendly and helpful and her food is terrific. go to the odd looking vintage shop/warehouse along the road which houses a bar as well as antique stalls - very funky! we used all these places over and over. the wee bar/cafe where football is on a screen evry night is good fun and the owner so kind - on our last night he sent us home with a gift of a special bottle of port! these places are out of the main tourist streets and made us feel like we were locals.

The place is immaculately maintained with nice, clean design and the views are phenomenal to wake up to.  We were only in town for three nights so did not make much use of the kitchen as we wanted to experience as much of the local food as possible.  We ate very well on both the Porto and Gaia neighborhoods. \r\n\r\nThe location is right on the River Douro across from Porto, right near the bridge.  We enjoyed the quick 5-10 min walk across the bridge to Porto to explore the historic center, taking in the views and exploring the neighborhood on foot.  It's a bit more quiet on the Gaia side which we appreciated and in our opinion the better side to stay on for easy access, better views and a bit more quiet to come home to each night. \r\n\r\nWe would come back and recommend this to anyone in a heartbeat!"},{"_id":"46517256","date":{"$date":"2015-09-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6871500","reviewer_id":"27660749","reviewer_name":"Perrine","comments":"Superbe appartement avec une vue splendide sur porto !!!

Overall a very good experience.\r\nIf like me you come in October, be aware there is no heating in the apartment, so it can be a bit cold and (being by the river) humid. However Marcelo told me he would bring a couple of electrical heaters for the next visitors, apparently they were just removed for the summer.\r\n\r\nThe main room, with the lovely view, is both a bedroom (queen size) and a living room (sofa, TV, table \u0026 chairs) with a tasteful \u0026 modern decoration. There is another bedroom with two single beds but no window. The kitchen is small but functional. Although the apartment can host up to four people I'd say it is ideal for two (e.g. a couple).\r\n\r\nEven though you should enjoy Porto instead of watching TV I should mention the flat screen is very big and I could even connect my laptop using HDMI :)\r\n\r\nBottom line - slightly pricey for Porto but worth it.

I was so happy for that! Guillerma is a strong and very nice person, we had great conversations. Only one thing to mention is that the room is not exactly a room, much more a covered area with a bed, drawer etc. But privacy was totally no issue for me, as she is very quiet and respects silence allot. I totally recommend that stay, also because it couldn't be more local – Williamsburg is the place to be, many coffee places and restaurants around.

Ela é uma mulher agradável, com uma energia maravilhosa e vibrante, e isso se reflete no apartamento, cheio de vida e personalidade. Apesar de ser um quarto semi-privativo (o que consta na descrição), em nenhum momento senti minha privacidade desrespeitada. Dormi até tarde alguns dias e foi muito tranquilo. A cama é ótima. Amei os travesseiros! Ter um abajur ao lado da cara também foi bom para poder ler até mais tarde. O banheiro também é limpo e organizado. \n\nQuanto à localização, não poderia ter sido melhor.  Fica a duas quadras do metrô, em uma rua com movimento de pessoas até mais tarde. Mesmo voltando depois das 23h quase todos os dias, pude vir a pé até o apartamento em segurança. Por perto há também boas cafeterias, bares e livrarias deliciosas. \n\nAh, e sem esquecermos do Harry, o gato.

Also one thing to note is that there are 3 bedrooms in the apartment that are also being rented out on AirBnB. So other travelers may be staying there too. It may  not be the best for someone who needs a lot of privacy. \r\n\r\nThe apartment was very clean and well kept which was a plus. The location was also great!

The only con was that we could not turn the A/C ON and it got hot at night.\r\nIf you are driving, we park at the Stationnement Place Du Parc (3625 Av du Parc) for $20 every 24 hours. it is 7 min walk from the appartment"}]}

The location is super convenient, as the Central Mid-level Escalators are only a few meters away, so it is very easy to get to the city center without getting into a cab or a bus. There are ample groceries and departmental stores around. The flat itself is tastefully furnished and maintained in top condition by Sabrina's super efficient housekeeper Perla. Three people could be accommodated easily. Only the bed in the smaller room is pretty small, even for a person of average height and build. But the room size would not allow for a bigger bed to fit in. The kitchen is well equipped, and there are 2 bathrooms, which makes it very convenient. We enjoyed every bit of our stay, and if we ever go back to Hongkong, we hope Sabrina would open her doors to us again :)."}]}

I studied in England, lived there for seven years( considering its a long time)  I sometimes confuse my nationalty :)  I love music both listening and making. I play violin and guitar and besides Im a dance teacher too. I am a nature person who runs away to the mountains and lakes and camp there in her tiny spare time. I work busy hours because ı only work with business people.\r\n\r\nMy place is very central which is in a walking distance to all puplic transports and easy to get to and find. We have three bedroom in my big flat and ı sometimes I invite my students in the living room for lessons but very rarely. If you see people laughing around dont be surprised :) The building is not pretty new as nearly all flats are the same in Kadikoy area.  My neighbourhood is very safe and everybody knows eachother here and all of them are lovely people. I used to have a dog in the last years as you read in the rewievs but my friend  took her from me to a lovely farm where she is free and happy. House will be very clean when you checked in and I dont do a deep cleaning until you leave so try to be nice and tidy :) There are no rules in this house!!!

Some of them stayed for a day and some of them stayed for three months bu we still keep in touch with most of them. I love meeting new people, listening different stories, learn abour their culture.

Make sure the host knows how many are staying there (2 is good, 3 would be VERY COSY).  We only had one bath towel, and one very rough (think old hotel) towel for our showers.  We also found 2 extra pillows but no pillowcases (so we couldn't use them).  Bring your own paper goods...and ask for another bath towel.  I will definitely visit here again when I go to NYC.

The wifi was quick and didn't drop out once.  When we first arrived I wasn't to sure of the area, but after the first day I had no issues at all.  I found out that the area is filled with students attending NYU.  I felt safe the entire time I was in NY.  Roman met us out front with the keys and couldn't stay to chat, but was very quick to respond through email and txt.  The door to the apt was a little tricky, but once I realized that the first turn unlocks the door, then the second releases the latch so it opens, I was good to go.  Romans spot is a pretty close walk to Little Italy, China Town and Greenwich Village (very cool spots to walk around) and a close, quick subway ride uptown.  We walked most of the time, but it was good to know we had options.  There is a great little Mexican place a few doors down from Romans spot which we ate at and I would def. recommend that.  Walking from Romans to uptown every day is a little hike (so bring a good pair of shoes) but we were able to do it.  Overall my NYC experience was fantastic, and our stay at Romans was just as good.

Also, the comforter pictured was not the one listed.  It was a cheap tiger blanket that looks like it could have been purchased at the swap meet.  We took plenty of pictures to document the problems.\r\n\r\nAs for service, that was strange from the beginning.  It was clear the owner did not meet us because he could not point out the apartment.  Once in, I looked for an iron and found a board.  There was no iron and I texted the owner who said there should be one.  When I let him know it was not there, he said it was not part of the ad and I would either need to buy one or get my clothes pressed.  Luckily I had a sweater nice enough to wear to a meeting.  As someone who deals with people on a daily basis, you never say that.  It is the equivalent to saying \"Sorry that is our policy.\"  He could have said, \"I am sorry.  I am out of town right now.  I wish I could help more.\"  That is less of a put off than what I got.  When I did contact the owner about the physical issues, he said he has been having issues with cleaners for a while.  With the owner being out of the country, I would think a professional property manager should be in place to ensure the place isn’t in bad shape.\r\n  \r\nOn our part, we should have contacted airbnb from the beginning and just left.  Since it was our first experience, I was not sure what to do.  I contacted airbnb afterward and have been working with them since.  This experience is clearly not the norm since we stayed at a nice place in Philadelphia afterward from airbnb.\r\n\r\nSome positives...  The kitchen seemed to be pretty clean, but we did not use it.  It had reliable WiFi and a nice TV.  The location is the best thing about it.  You can walk to a lot of good restaurants, bars and shops.  I also felt pretty safe at any time walking around.  These do not make up for the physical problems with this place and an owner that doesn’t seem too concerned with meeting his tenants needs.  \r\n \r\n"},{"_id":"4133333","date":{"$date":"2013-04-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"695002","reviewer_id":"4475423","reviewer_name":"Laura","comments":"El apartamento estaba igual que se muestra en las fotos, muy bonito,acogedor y reformado recientemente.

Before arriving, I was a little afraid that things might not work out and that we would have to wait, but everything was so easy with him.\r\nThe apartment itself was great and looked just as advertised on the pictures.\r\nI would like to say something about the location: To be honest, before booking the appartment, we didn't know the exact address, we only knew that it was located in East Village but after booking we could see that it was in Alphabet City and I wasn't very happy about that because of what is being said about this part of town. The day we left for NY, I was really nervous about the area. BUT the location is simply amazing! It is absolutely safe and I didn't feel weird at any time. The L-train is very close by (connecting you to all major subway-lines and all of NY's must-sees within minutes) and so are many great places such as bars, restaurants, diners, and the post office.\r\nAll in all, considering the three most important aspects for picking a place to stay, host, apartment, location, I can absoultely recommend this place."},{"_id":"7629653","date":{"$date":"2013-09-27T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"695002","reviewer_id":"8692257","reviewer_name":"María Camila","comments":"We had a great time in Andre´s apartment.

Located in a good neighbourhood, lots of fun restaurants and close to a subway stop and two parks.  It has a separate bathroom, no separate bedroom. It fits two people fine, but for three people it really is too small. It's quiet, functional, not very cosy, a little cluttered (with cables and boxes), and, unfortunately, not very clean. When we arrived, we had to ask for clean sheets (the sheets on the beds hadn't been cleaned and had hair and stains on them) and also for someone to clean the apartment the next day, because it hadn't been cleaned.\r\nWe were met by a friend of the owners, who was really friendly and kind enough to wait for us to arrive in the evening, even though we were an hour late because our plane was delayed. He was available at all tines, which was lovely - he eve came back at night with the clean sheets. He tried to help with the cleaning, but after he came in the next day, most of the apartment was still really grubby, especially the bathroom. I noticed one of the other guests commenting on this, but didn't pay much attention to it at the time. However, we travel a lot, and this is the first time we were a little disgusted by our surroundings. \r\nThe apartment basically contains everything you need though (tv, microwave, stove, cutlery, dishware, cooking oil, paper towels, matches, candles, condiments), and has an excellent shower (we didn't use the bath because it was too grubby). No hair dryer of kitchen towels, so you will have to bring these yourselves. The bed had a soft foam mattress, we slept very well on it. They were also very flexible on check in and check out, we arrived at ten thirty at night and checked out around two o'clock in the afternoon.\r\nAll in all, we had a great stay in NY, but I don't think I would rent this apartment again. For what we paid for it, it just didn't offer enough value, eventhough the neighbourhood was great. Plus we paid 31 dollars in cleaning costs and ended up cleaning the essentials ourselves.

We were a bit disappointed as he told us he would meet us at the apartment to greet us and give us the key, however when we arrived from the airport he was not there. If it weren't for the fact that I could get wifi on my phone to find out he had left the keys at the pizza restaurant opposite, we would have been stranded. The phone number that had been provided to us was also different from Andre's actual number, which certainly didn't help getting in contact with him! The apartment had clean sheets and towels, however that was basically it - no mugs to make tea/coffee, one roll of toilet paper to last 10 days, no information at all about the area or NYC, one towel each to last our entire stay, no soap etc etc. We also didn't find the apartment to be very clean, with old food left in the fridge and dirty cutlery in the draws. The bed was the most uncomfortable bed we'd ever slept on, with half the slats underneath broken and the mattress half falling onto the floor! The location was good with restaurants, supermarkets and subway nearby. I don't usually like leaving negative reviews, but we really didn't think this apartment was adequate or left for us in an appropriate state. If you're looking for a very basic place to stay in New York, this apartment might appeal to you, however I wouldn't recommend this to my friends.

The location of the apartment is so convenient to discover Manhatten, Chelsea and Brooklyn - and of course the East Village itself. Being on the L line (subway) makes it very convenient to get anywhere within no time. Lots of nice restaurants and coffee shops and bars around. Katie provided quick responses to my questions. She was very helpful and accommodating when it came to the pick up of the keys (thanks again!!). The apartment was clean. Bedding and Towels were provided, so were bin bags, soap, toilet paper, washing up liquid. Great service! Note: no iron available, so bring one if you feel you'll need it. I would also recommend bringing some ear plugs if you are not used to the noise of a big city."},{"_id":"16428956","date":{"$date":"2014-07-27T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"695002","reviewer_id":"1118352","reviewer_name":"Rolf","comments":"We spent two nights in Katie's apartment.

She was not able to meet me personally for the check-in (work reasons) but she made arrangements to have a friend prepare the apartment so the check-in was very quick and simple. Her studio in the lower east side is conveniently located near many popular restaurants and bars. Everything is within walking distance and if you needed to go somewhere farther, the 6 train is still within walking distance. If you ever do stay here, I can recommend a biscuit place which is literally right downstairs. Great food and it is open 24 hours. Overall, the apartment and neighborhood is great. The nightlife around there is nice but will not disturb you when you are sleeping. Great price for a 3day 2night stay. I will probably stay here again when I have another little weekend off.

The bathroom is narrow, but serviceable with a nice new showerhead.  The kitchen was spotless and fully equipped, the large table doubling as a convenient workspace. The bed was a futon and not altogether agreeable to one accustomed to a regular mattress -- but, soon to be replaced, I'm told.  Here's the astonishing thing: the place is extraordinarily quiet for Manhattan -- almost preternaturally quiet  -- a welcome respite from the din of the city and a boon for sleeping! The neighborhood is rife with restaurants and other amenities, and  not least of all,  Janice, the host, was a most congenial, helpful and a responsive communicator."},{"_id":"271883081","date":{"$date":"2018-06-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6958924","reviewer_id":"4772111","reviewer_name":"Thilo","comments":"Eine kleine aber feine Wohnung.

As Terry had mentioned, the room did not have a window - not ideal but not an issue if you're exploring the city, and the living room / patio are nice for hanging out. The AC motor for the apartment is in the room and is noisy, so not great for light sleepers. The roof is an amazing space with an incredible view of Manhattan.

The room and flat was cleaned by a professional company before we arrived so it was very clean. The private bathroom and the washer/dryer in a room was very convenient and worked well as we used it once.   Rawan make some space in her closet and left few hangers for us that was well appreciate, she left as well in a bathroom shampoo and others staff to use, we had our stuff so we didn't use it by it's a nice gesture . The air conditioning was working well, it was very warm during our time in New York 35 degrees, we used it only when we arrived and cut it during night time as it was a bit noisy but obviously we are happy to have it ! We used the kitchen, there is everything you need to prepared your meal (toaster, fridge, kettle, microwave, oven, appliances). In a flat there is two other rooms, one is occupied by Rawan roommate and another one near to the kitchen area dedicated for other airbnb person. During our stay another guy arrived 2 days after us very nice, we had few talk together ! If you are coming by car it's a good place to stay as you can park in her street or the next one for free just be careful with the sign the Thursday morning between 8.30 to 10am you have to move you car to the other side and the same thing for the Friday morning. If you move your car at 8.15am you will find space, lot of people are going to work at this time.\nRawan was very helpful as I booked the wrong date, she accommodated me, she answered to me in a minute as soon as I had a question for her. Thanks again for all your help, you have been pleasant to deal with. \nThe tube station is at five minutes walk I advised you the Clinton/Washington one the G line as the street is nice to walk. If you want to go to Times Square you will have to change for the 7 ( purple line) at court square.\n"},{"_id":"93366613","date":{"$date":"2016-08-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6972673","reviewer_id":"57048144","reviewer_name":"Kennedy","comments":"Rawan was terrific.

Pool is at least as good as the pictures indicates. Our teenager gave it high marks, and especially with the slides, would expect it to be popular with younger kids too. No hesitation about recommending Candace and this location."},{"_id":"72137115","date":{"$date":"2016-05-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6974185","reviewer_id":"48446091","reviewer_name":"Alexis","comments":"This condo is BEAUTIFUL.

My boyfriend and I visited New York for the weekend, so it did the job. The room wasn't set-up when we arrived due to a personal issue she had with an old tenant. However, she got in contact with us in advance and mentioned the problem. The room could've used some dusting and there was a fly problem. \n\nMy boyfriend and I got back late one night and we had trouble unlocking her door. After so many attempts we decided to give her a call to see if she was at the apartment. We proceeded to call her a few times and she not once picked up. We waited outside of her apartment for several minutes and luckily we found someone kind to open the door for us, only to find Sarah up roaming around the apartment.  The location was fairly convenient and the subway was at close proximity.

It's super close to the subway and the express lines, so you are in midtown in only 10 minutes! It's REALLY convenient!\r\nThe room is also very quiet and perfect to have a rest. No street noise and we had no problems with noises from neighbors. \r\nSarah is fantastic and a great host. She is super kind and fun and answers all the messages very fast. She was amazing with our son! Thank you, Sarah for being such a great person! :)\r\nWe found the room and common area in the apartment to be a little bit dark. But we also spent quite a lot of time in the apartment. If you plan to visit the city, I don't think this should be an issue. \r\nThe only detail that made that we didn't feel totally at home was Sarah's roommate. Maybe it's just the way she is or maybe she had a couple of bad days, but we had the feeling that we were disturbing her and especially that she wasn't very happy about the presence of our baby boy. That's just a feeling and something very personal and subjective, but still I wanted to mention it. I'm sure, guests who aren't traveling with a baby and who don't spend much time in the apartment won't have this experience at all and in any case her roommate is most of the time out of the house. \r\nAgain, this is such a convenient place!! It's looks a bit far on the map but it's sooo close to everything! I would recommend it to anyone who wants to visit the city with a small budget.

The bedroom was clean and the bed was very comfortable. The distance to the subway is 4 minutes by foot and the ride to Times Square is only 10 minutes with the express subway. We never felt insecure in the neighborhood so please forget about the Harlem Story’s. These are so 1990. It was my third stay in Harlem and every time was great. \n\nThe problem is that the walls of the apartment are very thin, so you hear all the noise. Whether the conversations of the neighbours, the barking dog and crying baby of them or if someone in the apartment turns on the stove or is making any other noise. \nSince Sarah works in the evening and comes home late at night, you really hear every step when she prepares something to eat then. We bought ear plugs, so it was okay. We therefore really recommend that anyone who does not sleep like a stone should take ear plugs. We were around Helloween and Sarah had a very tight schedule so we barely saw her. It was absolutely no problem for us because we like being independent. Unfortunately, you also saw the absence in the cleanliness of the bathroom and the kitchen. There are dust and dirt in the corners. I do not want to say that it was absolutely bad, but it was not really clean either.\n\nThe fact that Sarah works at night you should be very considerate in the morning, so it is better to get the breakfast away from home, otherwise she will notice everything and her sleep will be interrupted and since you are good guests you don‘t want that to happen ;-)\n\nYou have to live out of the suitcase. It would be great to have a little rack or closet in the room to store the luggage. Also a small mirror on the wall would be perfect, so one could get ready in the bathroom and the other in the bedroom. But these are only little suggestions no real big problems. \n\nConsidering the price for a New York accommodation, I'd like to point out that you can not expect a 5 star hotel but a solid place to stay if you're in NYC all day.\n\nTherefore the following points:\nPrice: 5 out of 5 points\nCleanliness: 2,5 out of 5 points\nNoise: 1,5 out of 5 points\nHost: 4 out of 5 points\nNeighborhood: 4,5 out of 5 points\nEquipment: 2,5 out of 5 points\n\nTotal: 3,5 out of 5 points"},{"_id":"208677669","date":{"$date":"2017-11-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6977204","reviewer_id":"24601907","reviewer_name":"Kathleen","comments":"Easily reachable by subway and walking distance to Columbia University.

I would just suggest to put a plank of wood on the bedhead to avoid the building opposite to have a view on your room like they have now. \n\nSarah is a joyful person and it’s visible that she wants you to enjoy your stay, but you have to follow the rules, so many rules. In fact, they are not really constraining at least for someone who just wants a place to sleep (which was our case), but when you receive a message at 2am to remind you to put down the toilet seat, or, more serious, when you wait 30min outside in the rain because « the check-in was at 12, not 11:30 » while she was at home, it put some stress on your nerves. We understand that she might not have been ready, but we were here in advance, not by choice, but because of the rain, she could have proposed to wait in the hall for example. \n\nI’m not saying that Sarah isn’t a good host, she is kind and you quickly understand that she wants you to have a great stay, but she forgets that for most, you are in a city you don’t know and even if you want to be faultless, you won’t always be.\n\nIn short I would recommend this place, but remember that you’re an extra and must not be noisy."},{"_id":"305643078","date":{"$date":"2018-08-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6977204","reviewer_id":"21294103","reviewer_name":"Oceane","comments":"Bon séjour chez Sarah malgré que nous ne l’avons vue qu’une seule fois pendant notre séjour ..."},{"_id":"307515142","date":{"$date":"2018-08-14T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"6977204","reviewer_id":"46899840","reviewer_name":"Simon","comments":"Excellent place and very clean.

In fact, we had only 1 neighbour as the lots on all the other sides were empty so we were surrounded by beautiful lush greenery. It's pretty much equidistant to Hilo, Volcano, and Kalapana/Kapoho areas so a great central location for exploring. The house had absolutely everything we could possibly need or want to enjoy our stay - maps and guidebooks, a fully-equipped kitchen, a huge lanai, snorkel gear, great wifi connection, good cell phone reception, lots of extra linens and towels, a big bathroom, laundry facilities. On top of that, we were greeted with a beautiful fresh fruit basket and Kona coffee when we arrived! Kirsten was so great in terms of making sure we were ok even though they live in Alaska. They sent regular emails to check in to see if we had any questions/concerns. It's a shame we didn't get a chance to meet in person.

We really liked your place.  Thanks for the breakfast on arrival and for the fresh pineapple (the person overseeing the property, I assume, left it for us downstairs one day).  Your tip for the discount Hawaii car rental was great and we ended up using it.  With the free additional driver, it was the cheapest option.  We also made use of the Big Island Revealed guide book that you had available at the house several times during our stay and enjoyed all the little extra comfort at the house.  We made use of the little cooler and beach towels on one outing.  The washer and dryer were convenient too.  It was nice to come back and relax and watch a little TV in the evenings then wake up and have coffee and breakfast before venturing out for the day.  \r\n\r\nWe loved Volcanoes National Park, went there two different days.  We were celebrating our anniversary which turned into an engagement atop the volcano!  We then had dinner at the Volcano House's Rim restaurant which was perfect.  Besides that we liked \"the strip\" in Pahoa and tried out the Thai and Mexican restaurants there.  I'd only been to Oahu before and liked the Big Island better.  There was more beautiful natural surrounding to look at, it was less touristy, and I thought the food was better.  I'm vegetarian and it was pretty easy to find good options for me.  \r\n\r\nWe went zip-lining one day in Kapa’au and used Big Island Eco Adventures II.  We'd definitely recommend them.  Not only did it allow us to see a different part of the island by driving to Kapa'au but our tour guides were super cool and gracious.  It was my first time and they were great at helping our tiny group of four feel safe and comfortable.  I hadn't been on others for comparison but my partner was talking about having to brake and land yourself on other zip lines.  This one was more hands free because the tour guides helped with each \"landing.\"\r\n\r\nI also went for my first ride in a helicopter.  We did a volcano and waterfall helicopter tour using Blue Hawaiian helicopters.  We also had a good experience with the people there.\r\n\r\nWe stayed seven days and did much more then I mentioned here.  It was a good amount of time to stay for.

She also sent a quick note on the day before I left to say Thanks and Goodbye.\r\n\r\nThe location is ideal for exploring Pahoa, making short excursions and going on day trips - before you start, get your smoothie or coffee at the Tin Shack Bakery, it's only a few minutes drive.

Their home has everything you need and she generously offers the use of their beach and snorkel gear to her guests. The home was clean and ready upon our arrival and we were greeted with a bowl of fresh fruit, which was delicious!  Do not underestimate the convenience and importance of their safe drinking water.  If you are on the fence about staying here or elsewhere, do yourself a favor and factor that into the decision.  We always had plenty of hot water for showers and dishes and had experienced no negative issues at all!!

The location is beautiful and serene -- well removed from the Highway 130 traffic and the relative hubbub of Hilo and Pahoa.  The home, with its open floor plan, is indeed well-built and well-kept (and very private).  The wrap-around lanai, with its views of the many tropical plants, was a major plus, and it was a joy dining on the lanai.  The road leading to Kirsten's street had an interesting and fun, gentle roller-coaster section.  Coming back at night was a bit challenging, because we couldn't figure out how to access our car's \"trip meter\" (with the tenths of miles -- Kirsten's instructions involved tenths of miles), but Karen had the foresight to count the cross streets on the way to Highway 130 so that we could recount them on the way back.  And we eventually recognized landmarks, such as the street just before theirs that had a street sign at a 45 degree angle.  The location of the home was perfect for accessing the beautiful Kapoho tidal ponds (some of the best and easiest snorkeling we experienced), and the home is about as close to Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park as is Hilo.\r\n\r\nWe were there during an unusually dry and warm period, so it took a while to get the house cooled down at night by opening the windows and turning on the ceiling fans, but the house was always comfortably cool by the time we were ready to go to sleep.  And we were able to hang out on the cool, breezy lanai while waiting for the house to cool down.\r\n\r\nWe never spoke with Kirsten (who is in Alaska most of the year) or her local contact person, Vonda, but then we didn't need to while there, because we had no problems with the home or with finding what we needed.  There was always plenty of hot water, even when we both took showers and used the clothes washer the same night.  The water was still hot the following morning -- and to think that all that water is heated by the sun.\r\n\r\nKirsten made us feel welcome by arranging to provide fresh fruit upon our arrival.  We were also welcomed by the soft, sweet chirping of the coqui frogs.  Some people don't like that sound, but from what we hear, that is because there are so many frogs in some places that they are very loud.  We experienced much louder coqui sounds near the Hilo Bayfront, but we love the sound, along with the songs of the many tropical birds in the Puna area.\r\n\r\nIt was very easy to communicate with Kirsten by e-mail prior to our trip to get useful information, such as the easiest tidal ponds to access.  We wouldn't hesitate to stay at Kirsten and David's house if we return to the Puna area."},{"_id":"20048542","date":{"$date":"2014-09-22T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"69935","reviewer_id":"1912748","reviewer_name":"Lisa","comments":"Nice big studio layout house with nook for bed.

There were no surprises when we arrived at the place, and everything was labelled so the inner workings of the house were easy to use such as the ceiling fans and washer/dryer. The house itself was easy to find and the neighbourhood was pretty quiet given the nocturnal frog noises, almost musical by nature.

The floor is large enough for one or two more but I would not enjoy the wait to use the bathroom with 4.  \r\n\r\nKitchen was great as we prepared every meal at home.  The bathroom was fine and the night light was such a nice touch for me.\r\n\r\nWe never turned on the tv but the wifi was fine even if I felt it was a bit slow given all my pics, going and coming.  Even my wifi at home in Calif is slow under my load.\r\n\r\nWasher and dryer were a nice bonus with all our activities.  A big box of beach and snorkel equipment were an unexpected bonus.  Maybe I should learn to read all the fine print.\r\n\r\nBring foam earplugs.  The home is in a wonderful rural setting so the frogs are loud and compete with the dogs.  The roosters announce the mornings.  After the first night I felt at home and some nights did not bother to use my foam earplugs.\r\n\r\nIn summary, I hope to rent this unit again.  Staying in a real home in that setting made our week that much better.\r\n\r\nThe location is great for lava flow activities.

Paradise indeed! What a beautiful house. Remember the bit in This Is Spinal Tap where the amp went up to 11. Well if I was scoring this house out of 10 then I'd need to go up to 11 too.\n\nThe house is beautiful. It had absolutely everything we needed (and more). Really beautifully decorated and very comfortable, we felt right at home. \n\nNo air-con but this is on the cooler, wetter side of the island and not needed, the room fans were more than enough and it was wonderfully cool in the evenings. The water is filtered rain water, solar heated for the shower. So the shower wasn't scalding hot but a sensible comfortable  temperature and that wonderfully soft rain water means you are going to be economical on the shower gel!\n\nIt's in an area carved out of o'hia tree rain forest and you get the impression of being in the middle of the forest particularly on a wet evening when the birds and frogs chorus. The effect isn't spoiled by traffic either, I think we only saw a handful of cars pass during our entire stay.\n\nKirsten is a great host, amazingly superb communication throughout the entire process, and unbeknown to us conspired with my daughters to provide a wonderful gift parcel, waiting for us on arrival. That was in addition to Kirsten's own fruit and flowers.\n\nIf you are looking to visit Big Island and want something different to the usual Kona tourist experience, this accommodation, half way between Hilo and Volcano is ideal.

The location was perfect for us urban Honolulu residents - far away enough from the city to feel relaxing but not so far where we felt isolated. It's conveniently located near Pahoa Town and only about 20 minutes or so from Hilo.  Also because it's off one of the main highways on Hawai'i Island (130), it was super convenient to get to pretty much any destination (and we traveled all over the island during our two weeks).   \r\n\r\nThe house itself is lovely. We arrived in the late evening (and it's very dark!) but Kirsten's directions were clear and helpful so we were able to get the key without any issues. She also arranged a very thoughtful fruit basket and the house was very clean, airy, and very cozy. One of my favorite spots was the deck - it spans one side and the back of the house, so we ate breakfast outside a lot to take in the pretty scenery; it was also a wonderful place to work because it was quiet and fairly cool during the day.  The bedroom area was cool and breezy at night (and we've been having major humidity here), so no need for a/c at all.  And, like Kirsten said, the water coming from their catchment and filtration system really is delicious!  No problems with any of the equipment or facilities while we were there.\r\n\r\nKirsten was a great host.

There is a very lovely cat and dog who are mostly outside and completely no issue.  The directions are perfect and the photos are a very good depiction of the reality. There's plenty of room to park the car. I was able to wash some clothes in the washing machine.  As it's a humid climate things can take a while to dry if you hang them on the rack inside or the lines outside. Ted always replied very promptly to my requests for information.  Keo is a super young man and I enjoyed our conversations as he showed me his school programs.  The location is excellent as it's only half an hour to Kalapana and about 1 hour to the National park visitor centre and Jaggar Museum where the lookout for the Kilauea Volcano active crater is.

Ted goes beyond the call of duty in making sure we are comfortable with getting up early to prepare coffee for us (sometimes at 4 a.m.) on the day we were leaving as we had to finish packing so we were up early! Ted had wonderful suggestions of where to eat and sight see. Pauline took very good care of us prior to our arrival with suggestions of where to shop for groceries since we like to eat healthy! It was our second time to Hilo but did not know that Target offered such great deals! At times Ted and John (my husband) would have a blast teasing me as I can be gullible and I am sure Pauline heard me calling her name as I was outnumbered with being the only female for a few days until other guests arrived but it was fun just like being part of the family.  We had the most beautiful and spacious room and bathroom, awakening to the Hawaiian sunlight and the sweet aroma of coffee brewing; doesn't get any better than that.  Ted even offered some of his delicious cooking (steak and pancakes) when we had first arrived as we were forced to stay in during the first two days of our trip due to working  on our taxes.  If you want a place that you can call \"home\" and not feel like a simple guest then you must stay at Ted, Pauline and Keo's beautiful home-you will feel like family after you arrive! We are already planning our next trip there in 2018  and have only been home 3 days, when the Merrie Monarch takes place again!

They were very helpful and concerned about our wellbeing and communication was very easy going, interesting and fun. After 2 nights we got the possibility to move in the biggest of their 3 guestrooms and enjoyed the space we had there very much. Coffee was already prepared every morning by Ted, and it was nice to have breakfast outside on their terrace overlooking the big garden. The house is situated in a silent, natural area and a perfect place to visit the Volcanoes National Park, the lava viewing area, Hilo and the beautiful east cost up to Waipio valley, also the value for money is great.

Mr. Bones is a lovely cat, loves cuddles and attention, but because the flat has no walls between areas it will go on the bed and make noise, if you are not use to this it would probably wake you up.

Very convenient!  There is also a grocery store very close by.  Jayanthi also provided me with some information about things to do and see all around the city; especially some great music shows happening in town.  The apartment is in a secluded corner of the neighborhood, and the apartment is quiet at night so I slept well during my stay.  The room was comfortable and the bathroom was perfect.

Also, if cooking is your thing, you'll love having conversations with them. I booked it for my bassist who came in from Spain for a few days.

Mit der Q Linie welche nur eine Straße entfernt  ist,kommt man sehr gut hin und zurück (Alternativ B Linie ca. 3 Straßen entfernt). Mittelgroße und kleine Lebensmittel Geschäfte sind genau wie diverse Imbisse(subway...) in der nächsten Straße vorhanden. Auch wenn es auf den ersten Blick anders scheint, ist die Gegend sehr sicher (haben täglich fast 10 Polizei Patrouillen gesehen) Bis Mitternacht hatten wir keine Probleme und später waren wir nicht unterwegs. Von JFK mit dem Taxi haben wir 40 Dollar  bezahlt. Mit der Subway ginge es auch recht gut aber unser Flug hatte 9 Stunden Verspätung daher hatten wir keine Lust darauf ( Nochmals danke für den problemlosen Late Check in). Das Zimmer ist nicht sehr groß, aber zum schlafen völlig ausreichend  (man fährt ja nach New York  für sightseeing und nicht zum Zimmer sitzen) Die Sauberkeit der Wohnung war sehr gut und zu den Straßen und Häusern muss man sagen,tjadas ist New York.

I honestly was barely there, because I was very busy but the little bit of time I did spend at the apartment was solid. The place is clean and homie, there is a great kitchen and Jayanthi was so gracious to let me use whatever I wanted and even offered for me to enjoy some of the drinks they had in the fridge whenever I pleased. Jayanthi was so laid back and friendly and yet very respectful of my privacy and space. The apartment, just like the room, are pretty small but cozy and comfortable. If you are looking to spend lots of time at an apartment or want to have a romantic vacation stay and dont mind spending a little more for a bigger more open room, then this might not be the place for you... \nBUT, if you plan on being in and out and mostly want to go out to the city, explore and visit new york AND have a homie beautiful space to lay your head, take a lovely shower, be able to cook some home made food and relax at the end of the without breaking the bank or worrying about what time you come back home without having go answer to anyone, then this place, then Jayanthi's IS THE PERFECT PLACE FOR YOU! The place might seem a little far from the action, but it is soooo close to the Q subway (and a few other ones) which take you directly into thr heart of Manhattan in less than 20 min. The neighbourhood has lots of jamaican and carribean residents and can seem a little grungy, but I definitely felt safe walking around and during the day it is lovely to explore the area, check out some unique food and cultures. Awesome stay!!! Good value!

Rebekah provided fresh flowers, fresh tropical bananas, BBQ grill with everything we needed to grill, and every possible thing needed for the beach: boogie boards, surf boards (to rent) with a roof rack, sand toys, snorkel gear, beach chairs and umbrella, beach mats and towels!  We loved every minute of it. Bonus: there's an air conditioning unit both in the front room AND the bedroom so the whole place cools down fast.  We loved our trip and can't wait to go back!

We ate all of our meals out, so we didn't really make any use of the kitchen (other than the ice cube trays in the freezer), and we didn't need to use the laundry facilities, but they were available.  \r\n\r\nWe had a problem getting the AC to turn on, but Rebekah came right over and got it working.  It was very hot and humid during our stay, but the AC units in the bedroom and living area, and the various fans cooled off the rooms sufficiently so that we were comfortable.  \r\n\r\nThere are several nice beaches within close proximity.  The next morning, we made use of the beach chairs and boogie boards that they had available for a quick visit to the beach before returning to shower, pack, and checkout.

But this place is so comparable in almost everything and for the difference in price, much cheaper here,  overall, I rate this place better, my personal view.\r\nTwo things, both were clearly described for us and knew what to expect checking in, my wife and son found lacking were: airconditioner for the wife and wifi for son. My wife found using the fan better than the airconditioner and my son found that wifi is stronger in the kitchen, after moving around a bit.\r\nMe, personally I don't like using airconditioner, I rather open the windows or go for a swim, and prefer to get off the grid when on vacation. \r\nI think this a perfect place to stay during winter months if you can't handle living without a strong airconditioner in the summer months.\r\nI prefer minimal interaction with hosts.

Clean, well equipped, and walking distance to the clearest watered beach we saw on Oahu. Perfect for a couple or small group or family that wants to get away from the city/waikiki vibes and just hang on the beach all day. Very close to grocery stores and food trucks, and across the street from the Polynesian Cultural Center. Rebekah provided clear directions, and had a helpful binder with suggestions for food and activities. \n\nTips for the area:\n- This is a Mormon community. They don't serve nor sell alcohol in the area. Closest was Tamura's market a few minutes drive south.  They also barely serve coffee anywhere, so we walked over to the Courtyard Marriott across the street to get our morning dose of lattes.\n- Eating out. There really aren't any sit down restaurants in the neighborhood. All food trucks, or casual/take-out type places. All of these are good, but if you want to have a nice dinner with drinks, you'll have to drive up to Turtle Bay (15mins north). \n- Beaches. The beach across the street had the clearest and calmest waters we saw during out trip. AND, barely anyone around. The softest/white sand beach we went to was Waimanalo which is about an hour South of Laie. We attempted Lanikai, but there was a crowd and they don't allow parking in the area on the weekends, so we skipped it.

However if your plan is to visit the south or south east of the island you may consider to look for another place.

We were staying at various sides during our Oahu trip, so it was nice to experience this part before Waikiki. Her family lives there and there was noise from cars coming and going, laundry being done, dog barking, but that was not unexpected or annoying.\n\nLocation, while out of the bustle,  was still convenient to many beaches and hiking. Grocery and restaurant options were limited and had more chain offerings. We didn't care since we cooked many meals while staying here. The kitchen was very well stocked with cooking supplies. Bathroom offered clean towels and soaps. Rebekah's place offered everything needed for a home away from home. She had legos out for my kids, which they didn't want to stop playing with - even with world famous beaches beckoning. \n\nMy biggest issue with this place was the smell. It had such a strong moldy, mildew smell upon arrival. We opened windows to air out a bit but it made for a disappointing stay to an otherwise great property.  The pillows and upholstery were pretty offensive to me and husband (who does not have a very good sense of smell).

The home was very clean and having a full kitchen was very nice. The A/C was enough to keep the rooms cool and we were very comfortable. Clean linens for all the sleeping spaces, plenty of towels in the bathroom, and even provided beach towels which was extra great because we forgot ours. The included use of beach chairs, umbrella, and beach toys was awesome and trust me very useful! They also have a nice variety of surfboards and body boards you can rent. Rebekah and her family live on the premises but you'd never know it as they were very quiet and respectful. They were helpful and accommodating to find a solution to an extra need we had that came up. They really are good people and very welcoming. Rebekah's place was spacious which is a nice change from staying in crowded hotel rooms and I highly recommend it.

A small, but amazing place that's located centrally. Multiple times me and my friends were very surprised how close this apartment was to everything. Tools and utensils were provided with little wine cups that were very cute. The only problem we had was forgetting to close the window that made it very noisy in the morning. Closing the window would dramatically reduce noise levels so that is a reminder for future guests. The apartment was clean and cozy. Highly recommended for a group of 4-5.

There were comfortable couches for a lounge and sitting area, and the little table where we ate was good for 2 people and we always had a \"romantic meal with a view,\" at no additional costs like the fancy restaurants. The bed was comfortable and the pillows were not thin and there were 2 \"tempurpedic-like\" pillows that my husband and I---and our necks appreciated.\nThe home also included dish soap and sponge, paper towels, soft Kleenex tissue boxes, liquid hand soap in the bathroom and liquid body soap with shampoo and conditioner. The home also included a portable fan  and hairdryer :) I share this information because if your going to stay in this place for a week, you would want to keep it clean because it started clean---and also because it's good to maintain the home so it continues to be comfortable. Furthermore, Kurt really pays attention to details. He had plenty of hangers for our clothes, the iron and iron board were of good quality and there was a mat and umbrella that we used as we did scenic stops and picnics.\n\nThe home's location is awesome and if you need any emergency items go to the ABC store below or meals without the hassle, you could call Teddy's burgers and just pick it up next to the lobby! Call ahead and order because the lines get long fairly quickly.\n\nThe views are amazing and we felt privileged to have such a view at a fraction of hotel prices. And we had the convenience of heating our left overs which saved us money--unlike hotels. We didn't cook, but the fridge is big enough to store groceries if needed and there were enough pots, pans, and utensils for meals. \n\nAs a host KURT IS GREAT!\nHe responded quickly to my questions and he turned on the AC prior to us checking in. He was kind and thoughtful.\n\nWe would love to stay again!\n\nMahalo Kurt.\nGod bless!

You will wake up each morning to a beautiful sunrise over your unobstructed and closeup view of Diamond Head. Incredible! You will be walking distance to all of Waikiki and the bus ($2.50 one way) and trolley system is so efficient  that you are not long from Pearl Harbor on the west to Hanauma Bay on the east and even places beyond. Leonard's Bakery with its malasadas is a 10 minute walk up Kapahulu. So ono! The building is well maintained, and the unit is very clean and comfortable. It is small, but you aren't coming to Hawaii to sit in your room, are you? Although Hawaii Grand is at a relatively busy intersection (Kalakaua and Kapahulu) we did not find traffic noise to be an issue. There is a glorious view from the 10th floor sun deck - a good place to have a drink or pupus in the late afternoon. The pool is small and not very nice, but you are 500 feet from Waikiki Beach. It was very easy dealing with Kurt. He checked with us before and during our stay and always got back to us promptly if we had any questions. We had a great stay.

Rechtzeitig vor Ankunft hat Kurt uns den W-Lan- und Zimmercode mitgeteilt. Außerdem war er immer erreichbar und hat noch eine zweite Ansprechpartnerin für Probleme genannt. Die Lage ist sehr schön, da der Strand nur ca. 150 Meter entfernt ist. Dazu kommt der tolle freie Blick über den Zoo zum Diamond Head Krater und, wenn auch etwas schräg, zum Meer. Die Klimaanlage ist neu und einfach zu bedienen. Das Zimmer ist groß genug, dass gilt auch für das Badezimmer. Die Küchenzeile ist groß wurde von uns aber nur für das Frühstück gebraucht. Es sind nur 2 Kochplatten vorhanden, aber wer kocht schon wirklich, zumal die Lebensmittelpreise sehr hoch sind. Das Zimmer war auch sehr sauber, Staubsauger und Ersatzmüllbeutel sind vorhanden. Den kleinen Balkon mit in den Wohnbereich zu integrieren und zwei große Fenster einzubauen hat uns gut gefallen, da dort ein Tisch stand an dem wir jeden Morgen gefrühstückt haben mit dem tollen Blick. Allerdings spürt man, dass man in einer Großstadt ist. Das tägliche Leben beginnt sehr früh am morgen. Lebensmittel kann man gleich in der Nähe in den ABC Stores kaufen. Die öffentlichen Verkehrsmittel fahren je nach Ziel in der Nähe ab. Der Pool ist klein und ungünstig im Innenhof gelegen. Allerdings waren wir nur am Strand. Der Strandabschnitt hat uns besser gefallen als der Rest von Waikiki, da der Strand an den Hotels nicht tief ist und voller ist an unserem Strand.

We absolutely loved everything about our stay! The bed was comfortable and we had every necessity we needed. The view of Diamond Head \u0026 the beach were fabulous! The location is terrific! A few steps away and you are on the beach. There is a Starbucks and an ABC store very close. We couldn't have asked for a better location or a better host! The deck on is terrific! We had our coffee and tea out there most every day. Met lots of nice people. Kurt helped our with ideas for transportation from the air port and answered all our questions. The staff at the Waikiki Grand were so nice and helpful. We rented a car for two days and used the parking. The laundry facility is great. I can't say enough about how pleased and happy we were? I know where we will stay next time we go to Hawaii! Thank you for everything\r\n thing Kurt!

He was very responsive to emails and texts. The pictures hardly do the views justice. Kurt was gracious enough to let us check in early! The place was clean and inviting. The room's set up makes it easy to feel like you have more space than there is. We loved the views and AC. The 10th floor sun deck has the most amazing views of the ocean and Diamond Head. We also loved the fact that Starbucks and plenty of ABC stores are so close (right around the corner). We had the chance to enjoy the Honolulu Zoo since it was practically right outside the door. We could see flamingos and hear zoo noises from our windows. The location is equally as great for quiet since you are farther from the main hustle and bustle of the Waikiki crowds.  It's about an 8 min walk to the famous Duke statue. So nothing is really that far away. We tried the burger joint downstairs for a quick breaksfast one morning. Also it's a great location for shuttles for tours. Thank you again to Kurt for the use of his wonderful condo and our 1st AirBNB experience."},{"_id":"76358687","date":{"$date":"2016-05-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7073250","reviewer_id":"46697826","reviewer_name":"민진","comments":"Good location, good accommodation facilities .

Kurt and his assistant Irene are very personable and while we were there, responded to all our inquiries very quickly.  It was the best time ever.

Den är precis som bilderna visar och utsikten är lika härlig. Underbart med stranden på andra sidan vägen, och trevligt att sitta och titta på flamingosarna på zoot. :-)\nLäget är även toppen om man har bil; man kommer snabbt ut på motorvägen och vidare åt alla väderstreck, och vi fick bästa tänkbara hjälp av värden med parkering.\n\nLägenheten var precis lagom för oss två. Köket var mycket bra utrustat och badrummet var rent och fräscht. Mycket bra garderob som rymmer både kläder och resväskor. Bra Wi-FI. Tyst och lugnt, vi sov jättegott. \n\nKurt var en toppen-värd som alltid fanns tillgänglig med fantastisk service.

The entire studio was completely spotless and sand-free upon our arrival, and the views were breathtaking. We did tons of excursions throughout our stay in Oahu, but even during some days when we stayed closer to Waikiki spending time in our room, we thoroughly enjoyed the simultaneous views of Diamondhead and the ocean. We even saw some adorable pink flamingos at the zoo across the street. If we had any questions, Kurt responded and took care of us. We also accidentally left some souvenirs, and Kurt sent them immediately to us. These kind of hosts are diamonds in the rough- and we cannot wait to stay here again!!!

The views out of your window are breathtaking! You are also able to escape to the 10th floor sun deck to enjoy the views even more! On a quiet evening, you can hear some of the animals in the zoo just across from your room. It's fantastic!\nKurt's communication: 5 star! He kept us informed of check in/check out processes and if we had any questions he was super fast getting back to us. \nParking: if you have a rental car, it's totally worth spending the extra for the parking spot. It's easy to get to and a secure location. \nThings to do: are endless! Even if you don't have a rental car, there are heaps of things to do within walking distance! Look up the free hula show on Waikiki, enjoy the Friday night fireworks, go shopping, enjoy the many restaurants in the area, or just sit/swim/surf at the beach! \nThe room: has a bunch of amenities! Before renting a chair, umbrella, or snorkel gear - take a look at what is available in the room! The kitchen was great for us as we cooked a lot of meals in our room and I loved all the tile and cabinets. Huge TV for relaxing after a long drive around the island, etc...\n\nYou couldn't get a better place, again, this really is The Absolute Best!"},{"_id":"193483937","date":{"$date":"2017-09-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7073250","reviewer_id":"98958813","reviewer_name":"Mary","comments":"Staying at Kurt's place gives you the best of both worlds.

Kurt provided us with easy to follow directions and easy access whenever we had a question. The amenities were all there, from filtered water, cooler, snorkeling equipment, lawn chairs, cleanliness and much more. Be sure to take advantage of this location to explore the many restaurants lining the beach for entertainment and dining.  Even on the beach itself, we had access to performances.

Due to availability, Kurt communicated that I was granted an early check in. The studio took my breath away upon entry! The green colour mixed with the beachy and inspirational art decor set the tone for the stunning open air window view. WOW!!!! It has to be the absolute best view of Diamond Head in Waikiki with the ocean at your fingertips. The sundeck provided a serene spot for videos and photo memories of spectacular sunrises.  Set at the quiet end of Waikiki, across from the zoo and park, the studio provides a luxurious blanket of greenery to gaze and daydream at with no concrete obstruction. The location can't be beat, still walkable to enjoy the fun things of Waikiki. I like the option of open air windows to breathe in the aloha and if you prefer quiet time at night windows closed with the air on.

The location was phenomenal being one block away from the beach. 5-10 min. walk to some of the best restaurants we’ve experienced. There’s an option for onsite parking spot which we found convenient since street parking was the only other option. There’s an ABC store that’s a 2 minute walk along with equipment rental(mopeds, bikes, etc.). Starbucks is two doors over near a Tucker and Brevy (restaurant that will pack food for you to take to the beach!). \n\nKurt was extremely friendly and easy to work with.

The name of his condo says it all, it is the absolute best place to say in Waikiki! The views from his condo were unbelievable! You were looking at the beautiful blue ocean when you looked right and Diamond Head when you looked left! It couldn't get any more perfect than that! Being at the end of Waikiki Beach was also a huge bonus as it was much quieter there but you could still easily access the rest of the beach and strip with a simple walk. Kurt's place inside was fantastic! He provided you with all the necessities of home that you needed such as shampoo, conditioner, soap, a Brita for water, all the kitchen utensils you would ever need plus all the beach things you would need such as boogie boards, beach chairs, beach umbrellas, etc. When we arrived there was a personal welcoming note from Kurt which was a nice touch. Kurt's place is an amazing place for the value! I will definitely be staying there again if I ever go back to Hawaii.

It’s got gorgeous views of Diamond Head, the zoo (you can even see the flamingos!), and the ocean, and it’s just a short walk from all of the shopping but far enough to avoid the crowds. The beaches are right down the street and there’s a Starbucks, Jamba Juice, an ABC store, and just about anything else you’d need to grab right around the corner.  The apartment is in a great building that’s easy to find and everyone who works there was friendly and accommodating. \n\nThe room itself was perfectly clean upon arrival and it even had a personal welcome that made us smile!  It’s the perfect size for two but can accommodate more, and there’s even a shared roof deck on the tenth floor with plenty of seating and more gorgeous views. \n\nKurt and Irene were incredibly welcoming, friendly, and easy to get in touch with.  When they describe the place as one of the best spots in town, they’re 100% right! It’s a cute apartment with gorgeous views in the perfect location at an affordable price - you really can’t beat that. Mahalo Kurt - we loved it!

We swam, played in the surf and sand, went boogie boarding, snorkeling and watched surfers right there on Makaha beach!\nThe entire back side of the house faves the ocean with ocean views from three of the four rooms.(2 upstairs with balconies and one downstairs with an ocean view from the window, and one downstairs bedroom faces the street.) The main living area is upstairs, so do plan on walking up and down a lot. \nMelody and Kenji were fabulous hosts and we would stay here again in a heartbeat!"},{"_id":"285114936","date":{"$date":"2018-07-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7099038","reviewer_id":"109856270","reviewer_name":"Todd","comments":"The house is great and very comfortable!

It has a very beautiful shopping mall which has multiple food joints, nice retail brands and a cinema hall, at a walking distance. The Porto FC stadium is just 200 meters from the flat. Joaquim himself is an amazing host and he ensured that our trip was made memorable. Joaquin's colleague Paula ( who helped us with check in check out and explain the things about Porto ) was extremely gentle and really appreciate her responses to all our queries. She took good care of us. Overall ten on ten to Joaquim and his property. Just one minor suggestion , the cloth stand on the balcony needs to be changed. Rest everything was absolutely fantastic .

The layout of the property was perfect for our needs, with our 18-month-old son able to have his own room. We also appreciated being able to keep our hire car parked safely in the secure carpark. There was a heatwave in Porto where it was hotter than usual, so we found the apartment a little hot at times. There's no air conditioning or fan, so we kept all the windows open at night to catch any through-breeze. During the day, my son and I retreated to the nearby shopping centre, where it was cooler, while my husband went to some meetings. The location of the property is a bit further away from Porto centre, but that suited us well, as it meant that my husband could easily get on the freeway to all his meetings. And the close proximity of the shopping centre (3 minutes walk down the road) was perfect for me. As a host, Joaquim was very quick to respond to my enquiry and very accommodating! We literally booked the property the morning of the same night we stayed! Joaquim was very easy to communicate with. All in all, a very positive experience!"},{"_id":"92844969","date":{"$date":"2016-08-10T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7110749","reviewer_id":"36947940","reviewer_name":"Susana","comments":"Joaquin ha sido amable con nosotros, pero la casa no cumplió con nuestras expectativas.

Things move at a slower pace without a skyscraper or stoplight in sight. Many residents still practice traditional Hawaiian customs, including warm hospitality. The small town of Kaunakakai has everything you need with a large dose of small town charm. Head to Kanemitsu bakery for a tasty brunch or late at night in the back alley for their famous hot bread - the perfect late night sweet treat. Molokai Pizza Cafe and Molokai Burger serve up familiar foods as well as local specials. Pick up groceries and other essentials at Friendly Market or Misaki’s. Souvenir shop in all of the locally owned businesses in town. If you’d rather explore the great outdoors, Molokai has everything an adventurer needs. The island has beautiful hikes, pristine waterfalls, incredible views and spectacular beaches without the crowds. From the hot and sunny west side to the lush and green east side","notes":"Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions regarding rates, additional accommodations, transportation, etc..","transit":"I highly recommend getting a rental car when visiting the island of Molokai. There is limited public transportation and a few taxis, but to truly experience what the island has to offer the freedom and cost of a rental car can’t be beat. The roads are not crowded and are easy to drive. With one main road, things are not hard to find. If you need help finding a rental car or if you have any other questions regarding transportation, please let me know!","access":"This condo includes all hotel amenities (except for daily cleaning) such as a beachfront pool and lounge, hammocks, a gazebo, free parking, ice and vending machines, free WiFi, lush and tropical landscaping and a sense of ‘Ohana (a family type of hospitality). It’s only a short walk (less than 2 minutes) from the condo to the beachfront pool and the hotel’s restaurant \u0026 bar. The condo is a 5 minute drive to Kaunakakai town which has grocery stores, restaurants and unique shops. It is centrally located, which gives visitors access to all that Molokai has to offer.","interaction":"The guest(s) of the condo have the entire unit to themselves, and is ideal for privacy - so there isn’t much contact with guests during their stay. But if you have any questions, concerns or curiosities leading up to your stay, please feel free to reach out to hotel staff or myself.

The host was quite professional, cordial, and exceptionally responsive. The hotel is a pleasure to stay in - very relaxing and unlike the polished and glitzy resort style hotels so often found in the islands. And their restaurant-bar veranda at the water is a tropical treat - there are even delightful and sincerely friendly local Hawaiian musicians entertaining  every night.

There were some nice extras too like the beach chairs in the room which came in handy as we took them with us all around the island. We also got to borrow snorkeling equipment from the front desk for free. Also, when we lost our card key for the room, we didn't have to contact our Airbnb host. Instead, the hotel just made us a new one. Oh, I would also like to mention that the Wifi is through the (Website hidden by Airbnb) free and was pretty good.\r\n\r\nThis location is a pretty central spot on Molokai, just minutes from any direction.

Molokai is the kind of place to experience rural Hawaii. The Halawa Valley Cutlural Hike is incredible and your experience at Kalaupapa will stay with you long after. The Macadamia Nut farm is interesting. Food is expensive and choices are limited; however Kumu Farms is a good place for local produce. There are only 2 gas stations on the island.

I came a few months back with a friend and stayed here after doing the mule ride to Kalaupapa (an unforgettable trip). This time around we just wanted to relax and have a weekend getaway from Oahu. So first of all, you can’t beat the location! Raymond’s place is located at the Hotel Molokai, just a couple miles outside of the main town of Kaunakakai. The bar/restaurant attached to the hotel is just footsteps away from your room, and it’s open 7 days a week for lunch and dinner. We had dinner one night  there and sat right on the water and watched a beautiful sunset. The big bed in the room is so so comfy—it felt like a pillow. There are extra bathroom towels, beach towels, beach chairs, and  keurig coffee available. Check in was simple and the a/c unit cools the room quickly. This room and the hotel in general are not what I’d consider luxurious, but rather quaint and comfortable and pretty perfect for anyone who would be interested in visiting Molokai. If I come back again, I’ll probably request to stay at Raymond’s a third time."},{"_id":"262429568","date":{"$date":"2018-05-08T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7112790","reviewer_id":"1668616","reviewer_name":"Mary","comments":"The place was just what we needed!

Heed the advice, and rent a car in advance!  Otherwise, your adventures will be severely limited.  There is intermittent bus service, no Uber/Lyft, and very few taxis.  The walk into town isn’t bad though.  There are bikes available to rent as well.  \nThe hotel has a restaurant, that’s open from lunch though dinner.  It’s right by the water, so beautiful views, and breezes.  The lunch prices are good.  Paddler’s Inn and the bakery in town, were also good choices. \nThe room was just that, a hotel room, basically.  There’s a microwave, and a nice size small fridge.  It had a Keurig coffee maker, but I’d suggest bringing your own pods, as there was not much choice in what I was offered. There was a nice size tub/shower (low water pressure) separate from the sink area.  The sink drain was having issues draining.  \nThere’s a nice, small patio where you can relax.  It has a glass door that doesn’t lock, and a screen door that can be chained.  There is a tear in the screen right where you could unlock the chain.  \nThe room also has a nice tv, with cable.  Cell service isn’t readily available, but there’s a phone in the room that includes local \u0026 stateside coverage.  There’s WiFi, but it’s spotty at times. \nThe room included 2 beach chairs, a sand mat, and beach towels.  \nThe pool has nice chairs, and there are hammocks with a great view.  The ocean there is very shallow, with a mud bottom.  Bring water shoes.   Perfect probably for kayaking or SUP, but wasn’t sure where to rent those.  The hotel does have an activities desk where you can sign up for tours.  You can also do that in town.  The hotel has a shuttle that you pay to use.  \nI never saw Raymond, and communication with him wasn’t timely (other than him letting me know when the room was ready for me)."},{"_id":"367001963","date":{"$date":"2019-01-03T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7112790","reviewer_id":"24085914","reviewer_name":"Linda","comments":"Raymond’s place was great to stay at.

They left us tips of different restaurants and neighborhoods to explore. The apartment itself was very modern and extremely clean. Great size, incredibly big for NYC. It was the perfect size for two people in the bedroom and another on the pullout couch in the living room. The air conditioning was wonderful as our visit was during a hot week in August. The wifi was reliable which was helpful.  It was walking distance to Columbus Circle with many trains available. They were even flexible and let us check out at 4 PM and leave our bags while we enjoyed the City.  I would definitely recommend Gill's place!!

Roughly equivalent in price to all 2 bed hotel rooms we could find, so reasonable value for us. Gill arranged an easy key pickup and allowed a late checkout (which was a breeze.) Grew up with steam heat, so the nuances of that heating method were understood and expected.

The apartment is modern, fancy and cozy. It's right in the middle of the city excitements; but the apartment itself, facing the back of the building, is well shielded from city noises.

Tiene una cocina a gas que no funciona por lo que no fue posible cocinar ciertas comidas debido a solo contar con 2 hornallas eléctricas, lo cual NO fue avisado ni tampoco solucionado a pesar de habernos comunicado con Gill. A pesar de solicitarlo nos entrego un solo juego de llaves. Cuando le preguntamos si el departamento contaba con lavadero dijo qué no ,cosa que no era cierto ya que se encontraba en el subsuelo, pero el no quería que los vecinos nos vieran ya que subalquilaba el departamento y eso NO esta permitido. Las dos veces que nos encontramos fue en una cafetería a media cuadra del edificio ya que aclaró que si alguien nos preguntaba éramos amigos suyos. Todo esto nos hace pensar que evidentemente en dicho edificio no permitían subalquilar  , y por ende se manejaron las situaciones de esa manera. Por todo lo expuesto no aconsejo alquilar el departamento de Gill ya que cuenta con muchas deficiencias.

Dessa vez a experiência não foi tão boa como da primeira. Abaixo uma lista dos aspectos positivos e negativos do apartamento.\nPositivos:\n- A localização é excelente! Perto do Central Park, ao lado de shops, restaurantes, cinemas, mercados, farmácias e, mais importante, bem perto do metrô. Essa estação é das melhores da cidade, pois há trens para várias regiões;\n- O flat é grande para padrões de NYC, limpo, tem ar-condicionado, bom banheiro e quarto confortável;\n- A região é segura e longe da confusão turística!\nNegativos:\n- O anfitrião não foi nos encontrar no dia do check-in (pegamos a chave em outro prédio, com o porteiro, há cerca de 12 quadras de distância) e o endereço listado no recibo do Airbnb não estava correto. Ficamos na porta de um prédio qualquer, perdidos. Ele não atendeu seu telefone quando liguei no momento. A sorte é que meu marido se lembrou do local certo, pois estivemos hospedados ali 2 anos antes e daí conseguimos chegar. Sugiro que organizem com o anfitrião sua chegada para não terem esse problema;\n- Se você pretende cozinhar durante sua estada, pode ser frustrante. O fogão a gás foi substituídos por aqueles elétricos de acampamento que demorava cerca de 20 minutos para se ferver uma panela d´água. Fora isso,a cozinha é bem equipada, com microondas, máquina de lavar. Se você não pretende cozinhar não deverá ter problemas!\n- Não compre nada on-line se ficar aqui. O anfitrião pediu que quaisquer compras fossem entregues em outro endereço, por questões de segurança, já que nesse outro prédio tem porteiros 24h que poderiam receber os pacotes que chegassem do correio. Esse outro local fica cerca de 12 quadras de distância e fui lá algumas vezes para recolher algumas compras. No entanto, 04 pacotes simplesmente desapareceram, apesar dos correios e empresas confirmarem suas entregas nesse endereço. Fiquei com o prejuízo e foi bem desgastante. O anfitrião não encontrou minhas compras até hoje e não encontrou solução para meu problema. Mas, novamente, se você não fizer compras on-line, isso não será um problema para você.\nDepois desses desgastes não acho que voltaria a ficar aqui. Mas, volto a dizer, em termos de localização, é muito bom."},{"_id":"188204607","date":{"$date":"2017-08-28T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7116864","reviewer_id":"34874470","reviewer_name":"Jim","comments":"Super location for visiting Fordham or Lincoln center."},{"_id":"194009044","date":{"$date":"2017-09-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7116864","reviewer_id":"117825896","reviewer_name":"Laura","comments":"Great location, so close to everything.

So when I wanted to check in I tried to call him and of course he did not answer during the first 30min, letting me wait outside with my fiancé...\n\nAlso their were dust in the flat (what the point of paying £150 for cleaning?) and the painting on the celling is if the paint is peeling or flaking. \n\nI was very disappointed and asked him to pay me back 30% of the booking which he agreed and of course I get no answer from him now.\n\nI think Gill is not a good host and not an honest person.

His place was simple and clean and provided just what we needed for a one night stay in Montreal. The heat was at a very comfortable level when we arrived and remained so throughout the night. The place is old, so be aware. That isn't a negative aspect necessarily, but don't expect hotel quality or the particulars of new or newly renovated bldg.

We used the kitchen only to keep ingredients for light breakfast (no stovetop use), but the fridge definitely came in handy. The living room receives a lot of light and eating breakfast at the table by the window (which actually has a quaint view overlooking a small playground) was a very nice amenity. Overall, an adequately clean, safe, comfortable apartment. The privacy was highly valued, as was the three-block proximity to the metro. A great value that I would highly recommend to other travelers!"},{"_id":"33859017","date":{"$date":"2015-06-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"712077","reviewer_id":"812763","reviewer_name":"André + Nikola","comments":"We’ve had a wonderful time at Karl’s place. The host was kind enough to leave detailed instructions of nearby places to visit, so getting around is quite easy and, most importantly, there is a subway station at walking distance so you can get quickly wherever you want. The place is as described: spacious and with a very useful fully equipped kitchen (not only the basic hardware for show, but all kinds of spices and things a person really uses for cooking). There is an espresso machine and a turntable. Both were very useful, as I could enjoy some java while listening to calypso record I had just bought (many nice places for used vinyl in Montreal!). There are some quirks one might need to get used to: since it is an old house, the wooden floors are noisy, there is a steep stairway to get to the condo, and the doors or windows might get difficult to open or close; actually one of the external windows fell onto my friend finger as he was trying to deal with a jammed latch. It bleeded badly and hurt a lot, but thankfully there was a first aid kit well equipped to deal with the situation. I do not blame the host, since it was an accident, but it is certainly related to specific oddities to what is overall a charming place to stay."},{"_id":"34417250","date":{"$date":"2015-06-08T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"712077","reviewer_id":"2972831","reviewer_name":"Genevieve","comments":"Safe area, easy access from the 720, easy access to grocery stores and the metro, and walking distance to great restaurants and pubs. All in all, I wouldn't say this matched the description exactly...when we arrived, there was no AC and no wi-fi. However, when we called Karl to ask about the missing AC and wi-fi, he was accommodating -- he came to install a window-mounted AC unit on Day 2, and he did try to get us wi-fi, but unsuccessfully. The bedroom window gives onto a sort of alleyway where surrounding apartments have their balconies. On our first night, the neighbours had a party on their balcony that kept us up until about 2 am. It was impossible to block out the noise. The floors are very creaky, which makes it difficult to be quiet (i.e. if you're getting up at night, expect to wake up everyone else in the place).

But - the apartment's condition didn't meet our expectations based on the pictures \u0026 price point (we would say it was \"fairly pricy\" - not super cheap, but not super expensive based on other listings we looked at). Would definitely stay again at a cheaper price, or if it was more polished. More details: There were multiple nights when the neighbours were loud until very late - 2am, 3am. Though the kitchen has plates, some spices, some dishes (enough to cook ok), it was not easy to cook in because there was no light \u0026 no small spoons and some other small items were missing. The bathroom was clean, but pretty rickety. There was only men's soap \u0026 no shampoo (though we were told there would be toiletries). The AC was only available in the bedroom, so it got pretty hot in the kitchen sometimes. The good: great location, clean, really attentive host, pretty spacious, and had great amenities (washer, dryer, etc). Overall I think this listing would be worth the 'fairly pricy' price if things were more polished around the house - it has a great location, great vibe, a great host, and is pretty spacious."},{"_id":"40725708","date":{"$date":"2015-08-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"712077","reviewer_id":"5651472","reviewer_name":"Mike","comments":"we didn't get a chance to meet karl but check in was painless.\r\napartment is in super great location, easily walkable and real neat walk... some good restaurants along the way.\r\nthe apartment itself is old, furniture is tired, some of it is charming :)  we had no issues, once that air conditioner in the room started doing its magic it saved our lives."},{"_id":"41111539","date":{"$date":"2015-08-04T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"712077","reviewer_id":"37319025","reviewer_name":"Rachel","comments":"Karl was a very accommodating host -- before our arrival, he provided detailed information about the location and parking instructions.

This made it an absolutely lovely place to have our morning coffees. That living room gets so much sunlight! We were also particularly drawn to this place because of the available bikes, but everything we wanted to see and do was so close that we ended up walking everywhere instead. The only downside was that the bed is ever so slightly uneven so that both people end up sinking into the middle. This would be fine for a couple but maybe annoying for friends sharing a bed.

Also not accurately depicted was the somewhat ripped and shabby furniture in the living room. Ok, so maybe not the best place for a thirty something married couple, but for those seeking an affordable spot in Montreal, this was hard to beat. What to expect: The pros: A great location, walkable to tons of restaurants downtown, and a fifteen minute walk to Atwater Market and a couple of metro stations. Also close by was a little park, which screens movies on some summer evenings. A well equipped kitchen - being in Montreal will make you want to binge on good food. With the markets so close, you may want to prepare your own meal (we just gorged on bread and cheese, mainly, but a fridge and toaster made this easy). A charming old building - lots of nice architectural touches like plaster molding, big windows and high ceilings gave the apartment an airy feel. It was clean (mostly) - the floors felt freshly cleaned, the linens were crisp and there were a couple of freshly washed towels. While there was still some trash and recycling from the previous guest, none of it was stinky, so not too bad. The cons: Parking - while Karl have ample direction in what the parking was like in the area, it was still a bit of a pain; when no street parking was available, we had to park at a meter overnight and be up and back at the car by 7am to either move it or pay. As this is a densely populated area, parking gripes come with the territory, but if you don't have to drive, you will have one less thing to think about. Transients - while I don't mind telling a guy \"I'm not interested\" when he's trying to sell me wine or stolen nail polish out of his backpack, some people might. Again, it's downtown, and this isn't the Ritz. Communication: As not everyone traveling to Canada internationally has the ability to text freely, it might be good to get instructions on how to get into the apartment in advance. While I told Karl of our travel plans, and when we expected to get there, he told me that there would be a lockbox with a key, but not the location of the lockbox or the combination, so we had to stand on the porch with our bags for a little while while we texted Karl for the rest of the necessary information we needed to gain access. He responded within a few moments, but having the info in advance would have been cooler. Bottom line - if you are looking for affordable access to Montreal and don't mind hanging out on dorm-quality furniture, this place is tops. 22-year-old..."},{"_id":"93894347","date":{"$date":"2016-08-14T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"712077","reviewer_id":"71863934","reviewer_name":"`Jordan","comments":"Karl was a very helpful host and staying in his apartment was a blast. if there was ever anything we needed he would offer to help and was very good at communicating with us the entire stay.

Parking on the street was great if you can find a spot in a free zone and keep it there, but it was difficult to figure out where to put it during the one-hour street sweeping. The wifi worked well, the area was quiet enough to sleep well, and the air conditioning was nice. The only real downside for us was that the apartment is really not for tall people. The bed is very short with a footboard that made it so my husband had to sleep on the pull out couch (not comfy!). His head also stuck out of the shower.

Very much liked it and the price for what we got. \n \nNote on parking: We drove up and threw my car in a nearby lot for $52 (CAD) for 4 days ($13/day). Was easier than dealing with moving my car and the street cleaning.  The parking in the area does require placards for certain times and free parking isn't necessarily in the immediate area.

It's also a very quiet area so we were never disturbed, and had lots of privacy. \nWe actually booked this apartment because we had booked another property months ago, and the host suddenly cancelled - we were really stressed when it happened but are now so happy it did because we were able to stay in this apartment instead, and it's much more our style.

The location is just on the outskirts of what is officially \"downtown\" (aka Centre-Ville), a block from Atwater Avenue, a big neighborhood border of sorts.  It suited me because I could walk to classes I was taking downtown, and because, courtesy of the bicycle that came with the apartment, could easily access the trails around the Lachine Canal, take advantage of the great farmers market plus known as the Atwater market, and explore neighborhoods west (like Westmount, etc.).  When you first arrive you might think, oh, the entry stairs look a little shabby, etc.. but otherwise the apartment is great inside, and the neighborhood is good, if perhaps a little off-beat.   A block or two in either direction are gorgeous looking row houses, etc, that would probably cost twice as much, if they were available, so I consider this an EXCELLENT value overall.   AC worked (important for the summer), laundry facilities in the bathroom (excellent for my two week stay, etc.).

It was great that it had A/C in the bedroom and a fan in the front room. We liked the green bike that was  included and used it to get around.

The location of Karl's beautiful apartment is perfect for a stay in Montreal: close to the metro, beautiful parks, down-town.  And the apartment itself is homely and gorgeous: what a great way to visit a city when feeling immediately at home, and that is exactly how I felt in Karl's great apartment.  Will cross fingers that - whenever I am back in Montreal - Karl's apartment will be available! Don't want to stay anywhere else. Thank you, Karl, for being such a great host.

It was clear this has not happened for a long time,  if ever. At one point, I looked beneath the couch where I was sleeping, and there was at least 2 inches of caked filth, dirt and dust. Then I began to notice is all over the house. The shower was dirty and shower curtain was stained, like it had not been changed for some time. Both of the doors are hard to lock, the front door and door to the apartment (not Karl's fault, but just a warning). When you walk into the hallway of the building your hit with a stench of natural gas (Karl said that the owner of the building is decommissioning some of the old gas pipes, so there might be a residual odor). I understand that this is an old apartment, but even more reason to try to clean it better and remove some of the junk. The house is really cluttered with all kinds of stuff.\n\nTo top it off the neighbors had a big party on Saturday night until 4 or 5 in the morning. Kept me up most of the night playing techno and yelling outside. Obviously this is not Karl's fault, but I get the feeling this happens somewhat often as the building and neighbors had a frat vibe. It was amusing that the \"house rules\" say not to have parties, well maybe thats because you can just join the one next door.\n\nOn a positve note Karl was a nice and responsive, but I don't feel that makes up for the condition of the house and lack of cleanliness."},{"_id":"326611100","date":{"$date":"2018-09-22T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"712077","reviewer_id":"2500982","reviewer_name":"Rosie","comments":"Karl’s apartment was perfect for our week stay in Montreal.

Kitchen is small (or about average if you live in a similar period block!) but has everything needed for cooking simple meals. Beautifully furnished and a great place to relax, plus amazing location. Only thing parents struggled with was traffic noise from the street, but some ear plugs and a weeks acclimatising to city life sorted that. Would highly recommend. Thanks Paul you were a great host!

However, the space of the flat itself is just right for three travelers, and we had a comfortable stay. I liked how the kitchen is well equipped as well. There extra towels and linens were a plus too. We stayed over the weekend and was able to catch the weekend market just across the street. We enjoyed that as well.

Also walking distance to Opera House, Botanical Garden so it was nice to walk around. \n\nHowever, it is also close to Kings Cross station and it could be little dangerous at night. I saw many drug addicts on the street and felt insecure. \n\nI am not expecting 5 star hotel when choosing Airbnb but I would expect more when I am still paying quite amount for the service. My biggest concern was the bathroom, not about the size but level of hygiene in it. I could see black mould from ceiling and wall, shower curtain was small and it kept sticking onto me when taking a shower and bathroom drain was rusty. I originally booked 6 nights but was provided 3 towels and no extra. It could be nice if extra towels can be provided for longer term stay. \n\nIt would be also nice if the cleaner can clean the flat more thoroughly. I still saw the hairs here and there on the floor (of course) and on the couch, not to mention underneath the bed, couch..\n\nUnderstand that there are bars, lounges nearby but the noises were quite disturbing as there were no proper soundproof. I was up until 2-3am for outside to be quiet enough so I could fully rest. \n\nDespite its great advantage of its location, I could not stand the bathroom and dusts in the house, I decided to move out on Sunday which basically I stayed for 2 nights only. This may be suitable for a single, couple, friends or family without child. \n"},{"_id":"101175505","date":{"$date":"2016-09-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7132426","reviewer_id":"57844878","reviewer_name":"Jill","comments":"Fantastic location with super easy access to public transport (we travelled via Kings Cross station every day).

I didn't see any 'drug addicts' around the apartment areas and the area has all the shops and takeaways you could need. We also felt safe in the area, and didn't run into any problems. However, On arrival, We were met by the cleaner who showed us to our apartment. The apartment itself is in a dilapidated building with marks, chips and wallpaper coming off which obviously isn't advertised. It seriously needs renovating as it's in a bad state. \r\n\r\nFor £550 over a week, and the fact that the cleaner had asked us to come back in 30 minutes when she had finished cleaning (after check in time), the floor was still covered in dust which we found attached to the suitcases as we had to put them in the lounge area due to no room for them in the bedroom, and the couch is also pretty stained (also not in the pictures). I advise you to not look under the couch... as it needs a clean before anyone does... and finally the bathroom is covered in Mould (also not in the pictures). Bath also needs a good clean, as neither myself or my parter were interested in one. Could also do with sorting out the rusty drains in the bathroom too.\r\n\r\nYou will also need to bring earplugs as an essential item, it took us 3 nights to get an 'ok' sleep due to the noise, over the weekdays too as the walls are paper thin. We live on a busy main road at home, but I can't emphasis enough that the road outside the apartment is seriously loud, don't underestimate it as it does sound like you are outside. I had to buy -85 decibel silicon earplugs for my partner just so she could sleep.\r\n\r\nThe guide to the area was good and the amenities were too, except for the towels, as we were given 2 towels between the 2 of us for a week's stay. The shower was powerful enough and didn't run out of hot water which was great. \r\n\r\nI also contacted Paul and asked about the internet issue on arrival, as the wifi is particularly slow. I understand Australia doesn't have the greatest network, but 2mbps isn't usable, so bring a 4G data package with you for your mobile. \r\n\r\nI understand that I could of emailed Paul and complained about the bathroom, towels, noise, internet, cleanliness, etc.. But I have never had to do this before or do I really feel I should need to. Previous places I have stayed have been great with air bnb, but there is a difference when unsatisfied and paying £550 for a week for the above. Believe me, I am usually pretty chilled out with accommodations, but this one really needs a thorough clean and some sound proofing."},{"_id":"102978469","date":{"$date":"2016-09-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7132426","reviewer_id":"3679185","reviewer_name":"Laila","comments":"A stylish and comfortable apartment in an excellent location for our two-night stay in Sydney.

Another thing to mention is that we were charmed by the musician living in one of the nearby apartments, whose playing added to the awesome atmosphere of the place.

Excellent saturday market and local coffee shop. Plenty of choice for restaurants and cafes. We were lucky enough to be in Sydney for Vivid festival which was amazing. The building corridors etc could do with a spruce up and the apartment wasn't as clean as it could be but nothing major. One slight gripe was we were hoping that the spare bed would be a single blow up not a double as it would have fitted in the little dressing room and given that guest a bit of privacy and we did have to move some furniture to place the air bed in an area where we wouldn't trip over it when getting up in the night.

Pros: The location of the apartment is excellent. Easy access to the train, taxis, as well as the ability to walk to just about anywhere in town. We had a lovely stroll from the apartment to the Sydney Bridge, Darling Harbour, and Circular Quay. There are many local restaurants and pubs to visit, we did not go hungry! The house manual has many wonderful suggestions. Cons: We recognize that these may be exclusive to our experience only. While communication with Paul and Luke was great, we did have some hiccups. As international travelers, we had been using WiFi wherever available so as to not incur any additional charges. We set up a time for Wendy (the housekeeper), to meet us to drop off the key. We waited 20 minutes until having to turn on our phones to try to sort out where Wendy was. After texting Wendy 3 times, she responded that she had left he key with a local business owner. It was frustrating that the plan had changed, that we weren’t notified immediately, and that we had to find this out after having to incur international phone charges. The apartment itself is as advertised. Cozy, lovely style, mostly well maintained. The double bed is a bit lumpy for our taste. The washroom/toilet is a bit dated, and could use a deep clean. The tub is rounded at the bottom so you could never stand with flat feet, it was quite slippery. While the tub is large, note that the shower is rather small and the shower head does not move. You are restricted to a small, rather tight area, as the shower curtain only encloses a small circular space around the shower head. Neither of us could close the curtain fully around us. The water pressure and hot water is outstanding. As pointed out, the street in which the apartment is located is quite noisy with bright street lights gleaming in that the blinds don’t fully block out, so lite sleepers beware, but that is a part of the city experience. Also note that the building is older. The entrance way is dark and has a musty smell. There were plenty of stairs to walk up, so if you have heavy luggage, beware. Online, the check-out time states 10am, though the manual at the apartment states 11am. Having thought the checkout time was at 11am, we were finishing packing and showering when Wendy, knocked at a bit past 10am. She was extremely abrupt, to the point of being rude. She insisted that the check out time was 10am, and suggested twice that we should have ‘checked our email’. She also brought a tradesman with her and was wanting to come in with him to start cleaning. I told her that my husband was in the shower and I did not feel comfortable having her and another person inside the apartment..."},{"_id":"158249086","date":{"$date":"2017-06-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7132426","reviewer_id":"63447909","reviewer_name":"예리","comments":"한국 게스트들에게 꼭 도움이 되었으면 합니다! 우선 인테리어 부분은 사진과 동일하였으나 곳곳에 거미줄, 다른사람의 머리카락 등 청결부분에 문제가 있었습니다 ㅜ 라면을 먹고싶어서 주전자를 사용하려 했는데 물때가 심각하여 결국 포기했고 창문을 닫고 자려고 손잡이를 잡았더니 부러지더라구요; 전 다시 시드니 간다면 절대 이용 안할겁니다"},{"_id":"158884534","date":{"$date":"2017-06-09T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7132426","reviewer_id":"49240636","reviewer_name":"Gustavo","comments":"Great location in a very old building.

Unfortunately he is not based in Australia and his local contact Wendy, the cleaner, was unhelpful and caused us to lose the first day of our holiday. The lock on the front door broke on the first afternoon and she originally said she couldn't get someone until after 6pm the following day. Thus we had to babysit the flat all afternoon and evening as we couldn't lock the door. We eventually got in contact with Paul who agreed to call an emergency locksmith. The locksmith didn't arrive until around 7.30pm, and it took until almost 8pm to fix the problem which Wendy was alerted to before 1.30pm. \n\nAdditionally, Wendy agreed to watch the flat for us when the problem first occurred so we could get lunch. We picked up takeaway so as to return quickly but found her walking down the street two blocks away on our way back. The flat had been left unattended, unlocked, and with the door slightly ajar. This was completely unacceptable after having promised to stay and watch our belongings and Paul's flat. \n\nOverall, the apartment was decent. It is in an excellent location with just a 30 minute walk to the Opera House through the beautiful botanic gardens, and lots of cool cafes and restaurants on the street and nearby. The apartment has the potential to be great however it is not currently being maintained adequately, with some broken window locks, burnt out lights, and mould in the shower. Having had a bad experience with Wendy we did not contact her again during our stay and instead put up with these issues. Again, Paul was very helpful and did everything he could to help us. We did love staying in the area and would do so again, and hope that Paul is able to get a better cleaner/local contact in the future.

The full kitchen had everything we could ask for, and we were able to save a few dollars by cooking in - although the nearby amazing restaurants and cafes definitely drew us in!!!

Aloha and Welcome!!   What a fun, charming and sweet place!  The cabin is spacious, light, airy and super clean with 3 comfortable beds and a hammock.  We were totally impressed, loved how clean it was and how easy everything was.  Lana and her husband Aaron and their adorable family are super friendly, knowledgeable and enthusiastic hosts, they went out of their way to ensure we had everything we needed and even shared some of their amazing garden produce with us.  The property is basically one big garden with tons of fruit trees and neat little flora and fauna.  We were treated to a neat coconut demonstration and loved playing with the friendly dog.  \r\n It is not your typical house, the shower and toilet are outside the main room, but private and clean, and just around the door (you don't have to walk far).  The water is on a catchment system and fresh drinking water is provided by the hosts. There is a small fridge and a two burner gas camping stove.  Simplicity at its finest and it works here, really well. We felt like we were a part of the jungle but safely enclosed from all the pests that come with the jungle, you just walk in and feel transported.    \r\n    We felt safe, comfortable and really enjoyed staying here.  The coqui frogs sing all night as the stars dance in the dark night sky (hardly any excess light around here, I believe there is a light ordinance).  It was neat watching shooting stars from the 2 loft beds.  There were 2 twin lofts, a full bed and a hammock all which were comfortable and clean as well as a couch.   \r\nPerfect jungle retreat, eco-conscious and worthy of your attention.  We will definitely be coming back and staying here next time we have family or friends visiting to see the current lava flow as the location is perfect and just the thought of this sweet place has us wanting to move in next door.

Simple description: It was an awesome, inspiring, nature rustic retreat. It's roughing it with amenities, immersed in jungle nightlife with coqui frogs. It's great for seasoned campers/travelers and those seeking an adventurous \"roughing it,\" jungle kind of experience, i.e., people who want to unplug, get off the grid, and connect with nature. It's secluded, but close to the ocean, nature parks, \u0026 volcanic activity. Lana and her family were super nice and community-oriented. They greeted us every morning with fresh coconuts – what a welcome surprise – and offered tropical fruit from her garden. She also lent us snorkeling gear. The space includes a stove, mini fridge, and running non-potable water. It's best to pick up groceries in town before arriving since it's secluded. Before we arrived, she emailed us a list of local attractions and information as well as provided a binder after we arrived. We chose the space because we sought to camp in Hawaii, but since we're from the mainland, we didn't have any camping gear with us. This was the next best thing. We got a unique, outstanding Hawaiian jungle experience we'll never forget. We LOVED staying there and would LOVE to stay there again.\nWe stayed at Lana's because we wanted a few days on the Big Island to see Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. In addition to the park, we went snorkeling with sea turtles at Black Sand Beach, witnessed an active lava volcano (Mauna Loa), swam in geothermal ponds, hiked in lava tube \u0026 on a caldera, ate lunch in Lava Tree State Park, and dined at the \"southernmost restaurant in the US\" with the best macademia nut pie ever.

At night we lit tea lamps, which lana provides. It is situated on their property which they are working into a permaculture and there are a couple of other friendly people who camp on the land who are working the property. Lana and aarron and their two kids are wonderful people and it was so lovely to be around a family that is consience of the land. They are very welcoming relaxed people who are interested in sharing their love of hawaii yet also give you lots of privacy too. If you are arriving at night make sure you have all directions as the first time can be hard to find. There is a very friendly dog who barks at first but after that she doesnt, and cat. Also Lana was really great to email us a list of stores in hilo or pahoa for shopping before you arrive. This area is so interesting, tide pools, night market, lava, clothing optional black sand beach, yummy thai restaurant, rugged coast.

It's located just a five minute drive (less really) from beautiful Kehena Beach and you're just another seven minutes or so to one of the coolest places in the area - Uncle Robert's. It's an open air kind of marketplace with a fantastic smoothie place, food, a bar, and one night a week it transforms into one of the greatest and chillest parties I've ever experienced with countless food and artisan vendors, a ten or so piece Hawaiian band, full bar, and tons of cool locals. Anyway, the location of Lana's place is great, and only about 25 minutes to Pahoa. The shower is SWEET and hot- and outdoors to boot. Toilet has a bidet which is a nice extra. Lana wasn't there during our stay, so we had the whole property to ourselves. She has a guy help out with anything you may need while she's away and we felt well taken care of. The grounds around the bungalow are landscaped beautifully and you'd have plenty of privacy even if Lana were at home in her house nearby. She responded quickly to all of our communications and helped us add nights to our stay. The space itself is a cool split level with additional sleeping in a little loft and there's a comfy hammock. It's an open air place with screens so as long as you're not expecting a sealed house, you'll do great. We used bug spray to keep mosquitos and no see-um's away and had a fantastic time chilling out here. Everything you need is in the kitchen as well. My girlfriend and I were super stoked to stay here, thanks again, Lana!"},{"_id":"348669048","date":{"$date":"2018-11-14T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7136708","reviewer_id":"9968078","reviewer_name":"Tania","comments":"This is a great place for nature lovers.

What a real treat to experience hand-made chocolate, kimchi and teas, and the fresh-picked/prepared treats from their farm that their beaming children brought to us each day.\n\nThere were breakfast, lunch, and dinner menu options that guests have the option to peruse and pre-order from for reasonable prices. We had stocked up on a few groceries before we arrived so unfortunately for us, (because it all looked so good!), we didn't order anything :(.\n\nSleeping in the 'jungle' with the night birds and little frogs singing through the night was something I hope to never forget and reminded me of home.

Before arriving we had agreed upon 1:00 PM as the check-in and check-out time. When we arrived at the apartment, we were greeted by Paulo's wife, who showed us around the apartment and our room. On the last morning of our stay, Paulo's wife knocked on our door at 10:30 AM and said she had forgotten to tell us we needed to be out of the room by 11:00 AM for it to be cleaned. We were expecting to have until 1 PM as previously mentioned, so that put us in an awkward position. We quickly got ready and packed up our stuff, and she let us store it in another room for the remaining 2 hours.\r\n\r\nThe pictures accurately represent the space-- the room is large with lots of storage space, hangers and drawers; the bathroom is also very large, with a working shower and bathtub and lots of counter space. The mattress felt comfy at first, but it is very soft and not supportive (probably an Ikea mattress).\r\n\r\nThe living room is shared between multiple other rooms listed on AirBnb as well, and it has ample seating for everyone with 3 tables and 3 couches.\r\n\r\nThe location was overall good for that neighborhood. Immediately downstairs there's nothing, but turn the corner and you're on Rambla del Poblenou with lots of stores and restaurants and people strolling or eating. It's also a convenient walk to the beach (just don't take your shoes off, the beaches in Barcelona were very dirty)."},{"_id":"43563068","date":{"$date":"2015-08-20T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7154153","reviewer_id":"29155596","reviewer_name":"Sofia","comments":"Chris et Paulo sont tres gentils et propose tous les conseils dont nous avons besoin.

Helped with an extra-bed, which was really very comfortable, had a bottle of water ready. One big room at center of all rooms is equipped with a clothwasher, a kitchen with all you need and plenty of space for eating/gathering. Sleeping rooms all have an own airconditioning (worked perfectly well). In room 5 (habitacion 5) we even had an own kitchen and 2 fridges, apart from a coach-bed, a table with chair. The surrounding is a little bit old-fashioned, but really quiet (absolutely no noise) and without feeling bad around there. Was told that this zone is getting more and more back to fashion again - really close to all! also the olympic zone. Just very recommendable! Just don't expect a hotel, and you will feel at home.\r\nPaolo would take care of any request or query about Barcelona's sightseeing.\r\nPaolo picked us up at the airport for 38 EUR, which was already a perfect start.\r\nThe flat is really very close to the beach, like 5 Min walk on a straight street. Beach is VERY clean and nice! Taking a taxi to town / Montjui / city center / Plaza Colon costs about 8-10 EUR/way (depending on traffic), by bus 1 EUR/person for one way till 1,5hours (you can jump off and on again within time).\r\nAgain 1 square further you have Poble Nou's own Rambla, which in my opinion, is much quieter and nicer than Barcelona's city center one! Great food at 'Tertulia' and an even much better Sangria at 'La Roda'. There's also hairdressers, cosmeticians, food shops and fashion shops... really all you can wish for!\r\nIf looking for great flamenco, I personally recommend (am a flamenco dancer myself), go to 'Palau Dalmases' at Montcada 20 (in front of Picasso Museum) in Barcelona city center. You will have a wonderful 1-hour performance for 20 EUR/person.\r\nAny entry to museums, e.g. 'Sagrada Familia' take tickets online (MUCH cheaper and you avoid waiting queues!)  - it's an absolutely must-see one.\r\nIf you have kids (also teenagers) and it's warm I recommend to plan a 6-hour stay at 'Illa Fantasia' a great aquaparc with lots of funny tubes. It's not the most modern one, but funny. Food will be limited to hamburgers and fries and ice creams, though (ask at a tourist info for an organised trip - cheaper).\r\nOur favourite zone within Barcelona's city center: Born. It's the ancient gothic area, with lots of little shops and bars/restaurants.\r\nAll in all, I'm sure to go back to Paolo's and certainly Barcelona - had a real great time!!!\r\nHave fun, too.\r\nBy the way, it was our first time in Barcelona and furthermore, on AirBnB. Feel very lucky having hit with Paolo's apartment and even more with his lovely family :-D\r\n"},{"_id":"92964177","date":{"$date":"2016-08-10T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7154153","reviewer_id":"12396184","reviewer_name":"Romain","comments":"Paulo et sa femme son tres gentil et genereux, ils nous ont acceuilli parfaitement et chaleureusement.

Paolo was very friendly and flexible. You share the common areas with other guests, not much the family. It is clean and situated in an up and coming part of Barcelona, only minutes away from wonderful coffee and the beach. It seemed a little pricy, but that might be due to the MOBILE fair at the time of our visit. Overall we enjoyed our stay.

Linens, pillows and towels were all provided, the beds were comfortable, and there was air conditioning and a fridge. The bathroom was amazing and spacious, and everything was accurate to the pictures and description provided. The shared living area was beautiful and clean, with a kitchen, sitting areas and a piano, which my friend (a composer) appreciated. Paulo was very flexible about us arriving at odd hours throughout the night and was overall a very gracious host. The airbnb is located a fair distance away from the tourist area, but there were plenty of fantastic local stores right next door to get meals and do a little shopping, and we enjoyed being close to the beach. Overall a great deal and a great airbnb experience!

My favorite part was playing the piano they have in the common area with his amazing daughter! \nThe bedroom was spacious and clean and had its own refrigerator, so great if you like to save some money on meals.  The private bathroom was also a plus. The common area was decorated with interesting artwork and paintings and had a very welcoming feel.  It is a great way to meet other friendly visitors in passing or can choose to keep to yourself. \nThe location is great since you are a 5 minute walk from the beach and literally around the corner from the Rambla in poblenou where there are tons of restaurants and shops.  Also it's a prime location for public transit with bus stops very close by and subway within a 10 min walk.  Poblenou has a special feel to it.  It's still incredibly lively but a nicer place to stay than the main part of the city if you like coming back to a quieter neighborhood to sleep. \nI would recommend this place to anyone.

You will find it listed in the old Kauai guide books, we renamed it in 2011 when I purchased the property. You can really hear the water falls roar on a quiet night after the rainfall, and you can hike to the falls from the back deck. Hence, what a better name than Secret Falls Retreat!. \r\nWe were closed for a while as we did many renovations and upgrades, but are up and running 100% now and look forward to hosting you and receiving new reviews soon!:).\r\n \r\nI am origainlly from California, grew up in Northern British Columbia, Canada. \r\nI love the outdoors and am a workaholic, always busy! Tim was born and raised in Hawaii, so you have all the local inside information you need:). We have 3 children ages 8, 12 and 15 that attend a private and public school here on Kauai.  They help out with the BnB when time allows between their studies and extracurricular activities.  We enjoy the beach, hiking, horseback riding, paddle boarding, beach Volley Ball, fishing, and soccer. \r\nAs we love music, we also own an event company called Hawaiian Muzik Factory, so we do weddings, anniverseries, baby parties, graduation parties ect. We also have large event tents, tables, sound systems, lights, and live bands.  Between the kids, the BnB and the Muzik Factory, it is a busy fun life in paradise! We look forward to meeting you!\r\n\r\nOur property has a solar heated salt water pool and jacuzzi. Located right in the middle of the island, so you can go to north shore or south shore in 45 min to an hour either way.  No need to bounce accomadations to see the whole island! We live on the property and are available for assistance most of the time. Some of the best restaurants, beaches and shopping is only minutes away. Hiking trails on the Sleeping Giant are within walking distance. We offer a continental breakfast that varies depending on availability of local produce and fruits ect. We do not have breakfast on Sundays and Holidays as that is our family time:).

Big plush bath AND beach towels for guests to use! We were also allowed to use bug spray and sun screen that prior guests had left behind, which was much appreciated.

No oil, salt, pepper, washing powder. There was no TV or microwave as advertised. Only 1 key for a family of 5.  The one shower drain was blocked.

There are lots of convenience stores in the area. The area is slowly but surely getting gentrified. Restaurants and cafes were about 10-15 min away walking. \n\nThere were fresh towels when we needed them. We really appreciated the privacy and the sweet basket she left with toiletries and the tourist pamphlets and restaurant take out and dine in menus. Other than that it was mostly clean and bug free!! \n\nThe apartment's locking system is great! The cell phone service in the apartment is not that great. But I we were able to do wifi calls with the free wifi. The AC was a life saver since it was muggy during our trip. There are a few things that could've made our stay better however I'll leave those suggestions for Debbie. \n\nWe all had a pleasant time! My family and I would consider staying there again.

Debbie provided us a bunch of amenities like soap, toothpaste and coffee. That back bedroom was a tad small, but the bed was amazing and commonly found myself not wanting to get out of bed. Debbie was incredibly responsive and attentive to us the whole time. The coffee machine was broken when we got there and she brought as a new one that night. The parking out front was free to us, but it's definitely a battle to find a spot and due to street cleaning, you will either need to move every other day or get a parking ticket. The subway station is only a few blocks walk which we used every day to get into Manhattan. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking to stay in Brooklyn and wants to visit the city.

I messaged her several times prior to booking with questions about the neighborhood, apartment, transportation, etc. She always replied in a timely manner. Upon arrival there were instructions on the table as well as an awesome welcome basket filled with goodies. toiletries, menu and maps! Her apartment is in a nice neighborhood, walking distance to the C train which takes you into Manhattan, times square, central park, china town and little Italy without transfers to a different subway line. There are several restaurants and bars within walking distance. Her place is cute and big enough for to comfortably fit my family of 5 which she kindly agreed to accommodate. \nThe bad- The apartment wasn't clean. I'm very particular about my space, some might say I'm OCD but when basic maintenance isn't performed there's a problem. I spent about 2 hours cleaning before I was comfortable enough to sleep there.\nIf Debbie corrects this this place will have 5 stars from me! If I ever visit N.Y. again I'd definitely consider the Putnam Gardens apartment again.

Debbie is an excellent and instant communicator--her descriptions were spot-on and the place exceeded our expectations.  The backyard space is compact, but divine!!!  The kitchen is stocked like you cannot even imagine!  There was an overflowing Welcome Basket with everything from coffee, tea and wine to snacks and city maps and an abundance of toiletries.  There was super-comfy bedding, generous space, lovely furniture (poufs, outdoor couches, throw rugs, extra pillows etc.) and extra decorative touches (and reading material) that truly made this place feel extravagant.  We stayed here with our three kids and Debbie even had a blow-up mattress for us.  Very minor things:  although there was a dresser, there is no place to hang clothes (we only noticed b/c my husband had 'work clothes' that couldn't be folded).  Also, there is only overhead lighting--maybe a lamp or two would have been nice in the main living area.  As far as public transport, there are buses nearby--we drove, though (we came from NE) and walked--parking on Debbie's street was enevr a problem, either.  When you visit Brooklyn/NYC, you will be quite sorry if you miss out on this absolute haven in the city.

The neighborhood is lively. The supermarket and subway stop is literally right around the corner. Laundromat is a block and half away. Central Park is really close as well! It's really such a convenient place to be. The apartment was really nice. The bed was comfortable. Everything in David's description was spot on. \r\n\r\nWe did run into a few problems. There were cat or dog hairs in the space. The ad said no pets allowed but somehow the hairs were there and it set off my husband's allergies a bit. In addition to the animal hairs, the space could have been a tad bit cleaner overall. It wasn't too big of an issue though. We just did a wipe down ourselves. Also, the heater was CRAZY hot and we were unable to adjust it. We had to leave the window wide open or have the AC running most times. \r\n\r\nOverall though, if we had to stay there again, we would.

However, if you are 1-2 people, this apartment can be a perfectly affordable and convenient accommodation for you. \nThe apartment is equipped with all the basic stuff one might need for a few-weeks stay. Small grocery items (e.g. pepper, oil etc.) were the only thing that was missing compared to other airbnbs I stayed in. So if you want to cook anything at home, you would have to either bring these items with you or buy them in a local store (which is just around the corner). \nA Subway stop is just around the corner (train 6) and a ride to Midtown takes about 20 minutes."},{"_id":"334615667","date":{"$date":"2018-10-09T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7242823","reviewer_id":"213143490","reviewer_name":"Jay","comments":"David's place was exactly as pictured and described.

The place was very beautiful and the kitchen had all the silverware. People who are going to stay at Desmond's place need to get their toiletry and a door sign for the bathroom. One major drawback to his place was that the bathroom had no lock along with creaky floors and stairs. The best part of the place was the hand shower in the bathroom which my parents really liked. Our experience has been a pleasant one at his lovely home.

The pics you see of the property exactly match what we saw face to face. \r\n\r\nJust two things that were rather disappointing. One of those things was that the driveway down the stairs was not a permanent spot for us to use for parking. Street parking at night was tough. The second was the lack of locks on the doorknobs of each room, especially the bathroom. Keep that in mind. Maybe buy a door hanging sign that says \"don't enter\" or something. \r\n\r\nBesides those two things, everything else was great. I would definitely use this place again.

If two people don't mind sharing a full (listed as \"double\") bed, the unit can fit 5 people at the most.\r\nOn the first night staying there, when we had both the AC and microwave on, the breaker tripped, which took about 1.5 hours to resolve (would've appreciated if Desmond gave us a heads up to be careful, but he was at work when it happened so I still appreciated his quick response). We later discovered that even without the AC on, running a blowdryer on high would cause the breaker to temporarily trip, so we had to resort to using a very small travel sized blow dryer we happened to have on hand.\r\nFor light sleepers, there is a railway right behind the house that runs at all hours of the night so I've been woken up by the sound of (what sounds like) large cargo trains driving past at 2-3AM and 5AM several times."},{"_id":"99531520","date":{"$date":"2016-09-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7246903","reviewer_id":"10007929","reviewer_name":"Rob","comments":"All basic info provided, and clearly communicated.

Desmond's house is generally clean (if a bit dated) and conveniently situated to transportation, groceries, shopping, a gym, and a park.  Desmond himself is quick to respond to any questions sent. And the price presented a pretty compelling value for a family or group of 5+ people visiting NYC on a tight budget who don't need anything fancy. \n\nHowever, there was a bad. Everything was going fine UNTIL...\nDesmond and I agreed my family and I could stay an extra night since the house was available. However on that final night, a stranger I had never seen before barged into the house from the basement apartment while we were upstairs getting ready for bed. I ran downstairs to investigate and saw a completely naked and extremely intoxicated man had walked through the house to sit on the back deck off the dining room, barely conscious . I confronted him and he got startled and ran off through the back yard. I thought he was an intruder until I turned around and realized he had entered the house from the basement door which was flung wide open. I closed it but quickly realized there was no padlock or way to secure the door. \n\nUpon calling Desmond he said the man was \"a friend who sometimes stays with him\" in the downstairs apartment, and assured me it was a mixup. My wife and I were in complete shock at the experience and had to round up our things and our sleeping children at 11:00PM to go stay somewhere else because we could not stay under those circumstances with no padlock on the door to the basement apartment and a possible naked alcoholic staying below us. \n\nDesmond apologized for the confusion but I feel that people need to know that if you stay here you are potentially sharing your living space with anyone that might be downstairs with no way of locking the access door or ensuring privacy. At no point prior did Desmond tell us there was a guest downstairs, much less a naked alcoholic. I would never stay at Desmond's house again, and honestly the experience has us questioning whether we will ever use a home sharing service again."},{"_id":"202049859","date":{"$date":"2017-10-09T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7246903","reviewer_id":"32683151","reviewer_name":"Geoffray","comments":"Très bon logement pour les familles.

He went on and on as if someone was standing next to him, and he was trying to impress them about how busy he is with his rental; while being extremely rude to me for no reason. Like I said, if he would of said \"it's not a good time\",  I would of told him no problem call me back whenever and hung up the phone, and it would of been a 5 second call. At check-in the host was nice I doubt he would talk to me in my face the way he did over the phone. The house could of been cleaner.

The house is spacious for NY and check-in was seamless. We had a satisfactory stay until our last day... \nBECAUSE\u003e\u003e\u003e\n\nBed bugs in one bedroom, the others were fine (photos were sent to Airbnb, so far they have done nothing). We had to stay in the other two bedrooms because we couldn't find anywhere else to stay at such notice.\n\nThere is a door in the kitchen that leads to the flat downstairs. It is locked on the other side so you cannot secure the house.\n\nOn our last day, we were eating lunch with colleagues when an aggressive man from downstairs (who apparently owns the house) burst in through the front door and accused my colleagues of being hookers! He must have had a key to the front door...\n\nWe felt unsafe and decided to leave immediately, one night before our check out. Desmond arrived on site and sided with his neighbour and aggressively forced us to leave the property. We were shocked and were worried for our well being so we left within ten minutes. Desmond then accused my colleagues of being \"transexual hookers\" who \"must have brought the bed bugs\" to the house... ( he sent this message to us through Airbnb)\n\nOur experience at this property is NOT UNIQUE however. Please see Eric's review from September 2017:  \n\n\n\"Everything was going fine UNTIL... First the good. Desmond's house is generally clean (if a bit dated) and conveniently situated to transportation, groceries, shopping, a gym, and a park. Desmond himself is quick to respond to any questions sent. And the price presented a pretty compelling value for a family or group of 5+ people visiting NYC on a tight budget who don't need anything fancy. However, there was a bad. Everything was going fine UNTIL... Desmond and I agreed my family and I could stay an extra night since the house was available. However on that final night, a stranger I had never seen before barged into the house from the basement apartment while we were upstairs getting ready for bed. I ran downstairs to investigate and saw a completely naked and extremely intoxicated man had walked through the house to sit on the back deck off the dining room, barely conscious . I confronted him and he got startled and ran off through the back yard. I thought he was an intruder until I turned around and realized he had entered the house from the basement door which was flung wide open. I closed it but quickly realized there was no padlock or way to secure the door. Upon calling Desmond he said the man was \"a friend who sometimes stays with him\" in the downstairs apartment, and assured me it was a mixup. My wife and I were in complete shock at the experience and had to round up our things and our sleeping children at 11:00PM to go stay somewhere else because we could not stay under those circumstances with no padlock on the door to the basement apartment and a possible naked alcoholic staying below us. Desmond apologized for the confusion but I feel that people need to know that if you stay here you are potentially sharing your living space with anyone that might be downstairs with no way of locking the access door or ensuring privacy. At no point prior did Desmond tell us there was a guest downstairs, much less a naked alcoholic. I would never stay at Desmond's house again, and honestly the experience has us questioning whether we will ever use a home sharing service again.\"\n\n\n\n\nWe were very disappointed because our trip to NY was very successful apart from this crazy incident."},{"_id":"408138546","date":{"$date":"2019-02-03T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7246903","reviewer_id":"7027682","reviewer_name":"Bethany","comments":"We had a great stay at Desmond's -- he met me in person for check in and showed me around the townhouse (which looks exactly as pictured) even though I arrived late in the evening.

We arrived very late due to our flight being delayed and she stayed up for us and was very generous in offering me a sandwich and some tea.  On arrival she showed us where everything was and gave us our keys and clean towels.  She even left a whole shelf in the refrigerator and an empty basket in the bathroom so we had adequate space to put our stuff.  \r\n\r\nThe apartment was as described.  The bedroom was small but adequate for our stay seeing that we were out most of the time. The bed slept very well and the window offered lovely cool air.  The room has a closet and a chest of drawers so you will have some space to store your stuff and a full length mirror which was lovely.  We also appreciated having wifi available to us.\r\n\r\nThe neighborhood seemed a bit dodgy when we first got there but we had absolutely no problems.  We went out as early as 4:30 in the morning and came back home as 11:45 at night and no one bothered us at all.  We took the subway all of the time we were there and the walk to the station was only a few minutes away.  We often did short walks to 125th street which has a few stores and restaurants.\r\n\r\nI would recommend taking the M2 on Lenox between 132nd and 133rd to the upper west side.  The drive there is really nice.  And you can get out around Columbus Circle and explore the area. So lovely...\r\n\r\nOverall we had a lovely stay.  Natalia was so nice and welcoming.

The apartment is well situated and about 5-6 min walk to convenience store, grocery store, pharmacy and coffee shop. From there, go down a flight of stairs and you have access to many nice restaurants. \r\n\r\nWe were welcome by Nova their Ayi  (maid) (since Nadia and Thierry were on holidays) who was really nice to us and even walked me to show me where the stores and restaurants were. We couldn't have got a better reception.  Moreover we even were offered the option to have Nova come over to watch our baby if we needed so and this for a very small fee. This is also great for parents who might want a diner out. \r\n\r\nThe place was spotless and had all we could wish for. But the most important for us and, I am sure, many other travelers is that there is a baby room with the cot, toys and the whole main room is baby proof. Wow that was amazing for us traveling with our 1 year old. \r\n\r\nBedding in China and Asia can often be quite on the hard side but not in this home. The bed and pillow were real comfy actually we forgot to check the brand of the mattress and pillow to ask Nadia and Thierry since my wife's back pain disappeared during the trip. \r\n\r\nThere were also nice touch like toot brush and bath products were provided in a small kit like in an Hotel.\r\n\r\nThere is a large balcony, very useful, especially if you smoke, since you don't have to go all the way downstairs.\r\n\r\nCommunication was very easy with Thierry and they are very responsive.\r\nAll in all we were very very please with the apartment and our host and recommend them strongly.
