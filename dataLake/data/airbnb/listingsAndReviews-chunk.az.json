Travelling around Rio, is so easy, I used the BRT, which operates 24 hours a day, I used the BRT from 05:30 in the morning, you can either buy a ticket at the station or get a weekly pass, it costs R$3.80 per journey, the buses are frequent every few minutes and so easy to use, the Metro system is good and there is a train every 5 minutes as well although it does gets packed at times.\n\n\nIn conclusion, I would definitely return to Rio in the future, next time I will take my wife, and do the tourist think and see more sights that I was unfortunately missed out on, no fault of anyone just on my day off there was cloud cover so I couldn’t get to see Christ the redeemer or sugarloaf mountain. And I would defiantly use Marcelo’s home again if its available, as I said he’s a good host and has a lovely family, it felt like I was in my own home.\n\n"},{"_id":"234607910","date":{"$date":"2018-02-13T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2283492","reviewer_id":"154826552","reviewer_name":"Joyce","comments":"Apartamento bem localizado em bairro seguro e prédio silencioso.

Plenty of great places to walk to for dinner, recommend The Chart House, make reservations for rail seating round sunset. \nSunset at the condo was still absolutely gorgeous!!! I didn't have to contact Paul after arrival because everything was clean and ready for pt stay! I suggest throwing those panoramic windows open when your in the condo because the sea breeze and waves are mor therapeutic than anything else you can pay for!

My wife and I stayed there for a week for our honeymoon trip, and we enjoyed every last moment of it. His place comes with everything you can really think of such as utensils, plates, cups, grounded coffee, etc. He even have disposable utensils, plates, and cups too for preference, which my wife and I used. \n\nThere's also a cooler in his place that we heavily utilized for the hot summer week. The ice machine is on the 4th floor, and if you are renting a parking space then the spot is on the 3rd floor. We just leave the cooler in the car and boom! Cold drink all day long! A quick piece of advice for those traveling on a budget, there's a Walmart that is about 8 minutes drive from his place. We got 24 bottles of water that lasted us a week for $5, or you can go to the ABC store downstairs for $4 a jug. There's also a Target that is closer at the Ala Moana Center with similar prices to Walmart as well.\n\nLastly, there is parking available in the premise for $10 a day. I highly recommend if you get a car as there's no parking nearby. We also like to come back around 10pm, so this would've been a greater challenge for us to look for a spot to park. If you go to an outside lot, I read it could cost an upward of $40.\n\nCon: There is only one working, yet, slow working elevator on premise that services 40 floors. The other elevator is being renovated and it will not be available until 2019. As the sign suggests on the elevator, it may take anywhere from 30-40 minutes to wait for the elevator. My wife and I usually leave the house before 7am, and comes back around 10pm so that does not affect us too much. We did, however, missed the elevator a few times because of how cramped it was after parking in the garage. We usually walk down to the lobby and go up from there for safety measure. When checking out, you should plan accordingly and leave earlier if you have a lot of luggages.\n\nAdditionally, if you rent Paul's garage space, it can be quite a challenge to get to the spot. The garage is one lane only with a lot of turns. Use caution, drive slowly, and always look at the blindspot mirror at the garage to make sure no cars are approaching."},{"_id":"301793893","date":{"$date":"2018-08-04T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"22878471","reviewer_id":"112960303","reviewer_name":"Josh","comments":"Paul was a great host who was quick to respond and accommodate our requests.

Only one working, therefore plan ahead. Many times we had to wait as people congregated in the lobby and had to take next elevator. Only 4 units per floor...sometimes we got lucky and wait times was reasonable other times they squeezed in like sardines and it was quite a wait. \nKnowing all this we would still book there, Paul was very responsive to our requests."}]}

The whole building is very new which is nice, but it does come with the caveat that building work around it is still going on. This meant it was very noisy first thing in the mornings- so you won't get a lie-in until that finishes! Then again this wasn't really a problem because we were in Porto for a limited time and wanted to get up and see the sights.

I am not saying that these are problems,  just so you know.  The description on Air B\u0026B was accurate.  The room was spotlessly clean, quite comfortable and very well located within easy walking distance of just about everything most of us want to do in Porto.  Even though on a street populated with bars and night clubs, it was very quiet.  Parking is EXTREMELY limited/expensive and we do not recommend that you have a car in Porto.  In my estimation, driving in Porto is nothing short of dangerous for the uninitiated.  We dropped off our rental at the Porto airport and took a taxi (20 to 30 euros) from the airport to the apartment.  We returned to the airport by taxi at the end of our stay and picked up another car to complete our trip.  Just so you know, Enterprise (operated by Guerin in Portugal) was very helpful and easy to deal with.  We made reservations in advance from the US.  Good thing because they were out of cars for people who did not have advance reservations. The kitchen in the apartment was supplied with rudimentary equipment but be sure you bring your own coffee, sugar, salt, pepper, water, wine, etc.  Stove, oven , microwave, refrigerator are there.  Supermarket for supplies was a 10 minute walk from the apartment.  Two mini-markets (which I do not recommend) were 7 minutes walk away.  AC/heater worked very well and we were comfortable all the time.  Bernardo met us at the door and was VERY helpful in directing us around the old city, arranging a taxi, etc.  He was always available at nothing short of a moment's notice.  We would stay here again."},{"_id":"349776098","date":{"$date":"2018-11-18T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"22906280","reviewer_id":"23688330","reviewer_name":"Lorraine","comments":"Appartement très propre, bien décoré et très bien situé.

The description of the property must be read carefully, possibly with direct questions to the hosts. We liked the apartment but were disappointed to find out that one of the two bedrooms and bathrooms were outdoors (away from the apartment). Because of the time of the year we were there, we could not use these facilities because of the  outdoor temperature. It is obvious that in the summer when you could live with the windows and doors open, these 2 parts of the apartment would be quite liveable. Joao met us at the appointed time (even though we were a little late getting in to Porto) and was helpful in organizing our departure."}]}

We stayed there with 2 people but you can easily be there with a small group and have a comfortable stay, although the common living area is not big. The apartment was clean, well designed and everything is newly renovated  (obviously with the purpose of being used by tourists).\nOverall we had a positive experience but we did run into some issues. We had an unpleasant check-in experience since the company that serviced his apartment was 50 min late and we had to wait outside until they arrived (luckily the weather was ok). Rui was very responsive and apologetic about the situation, was quick to contact them and they also called us directly to let us know they were on their way. Also, the TV did not work, flowers on the living room table were old (and mouldy) and a hanging picture was on the ground when we arrived. The company said they would send someone over to fix these things the next day but no one came.\nAfter we left the apartment Rui ensured me that he had broken the contract with this company and would search for another service provider.\nAs long as these issues are fixed I would highly recommend staying in his place. If it is vacant and you are going to Porto you have hit the jackpot by booking it!!"},{"_id":"260527851","date":{"$date":"2018-05-04T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"22938161","reviewer_id":"81547824","reviewer_name":"Luara","comments":"Ótimo ambiente, localização privilegiada e fácil contato com o anfitrião.

We liked the pizza place in front of the beach. \nThere is a supermarket very close if you want to cook.  Apartment is clean, big, comfortable and safe. \nRodrigo is a nice host and cares for you to have a good stay.\nJesus, the doorman is very very nice.\nThe elevator is old but it's all an experience to know this kind of elevator.\nYou can easily use the elevator or stairs because it is in a second floor.\nAlso can take an Uber to move easily.\nCONS: when I found this option it was not specified in the airbnb page I had to pay extra fee for electricity and cleaning. When we were leaving the apartment, Rodrigo said we had to pay extra 240 reales (~$80) cash for 2 nights stay.  At that moment I reviewed Airbnb again and found the 230 reales specified in the reservation 'house manual'.  It is not in additional prices or rules, etc.  \nHouse manual is not showed when you are comparing your options or before requesting reservation, only when you have already reserved. This is unfair to customers and other similar airbnb places and I'm very disappointed.  \nAnother Con is that the closest part of the beach is closed because they are removing the olympic stadium of volleyball, so you have to walk additional distance. \nI would recomend to have pretty small quantities of cooking materials, just like salt, sugar, oil, ... so you don't need to buy a big quantity for a short stay.\nWould I recommend this place? Only is they include the electricity and cleaning fee in the apartment daily fee or clearly specify it.\n"},{"_id":"108810509","date":{"$date":"2016-10-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2296225","reviewer_id":"9105348","reviewer_name":"Fernando","comments":"A experiência foi extremamente agradável.

From the get go, Mohammed was a great host. He got back to us within a few minutes and was great with all of our questions. The process of checking in was a breeze and the key was waiting for us. There were lots of towels, pillows, blankets, and other essentials. The beds were comfortable,  there were lots of windows which allowed for natural light, and the space was very inviting! When we booked, the amenity \"breakfast included\" was on the list (accidentally), and because of this mix-up, Mohammed had breakfast delivered to us. It was delicious and very kind of him! The location is prime -- it is right near everything! There is a Starbucks right next door and a convenience store a couple of doors down. It's close to shopping sites on Rue Saint Catherine, including a large Forever 21. Uber was very accessible with this location! It was our first time ever using Airbnb and we had a great experience. Thank you to Mohammed! Recommend this as a place to stay in Montreal!"},{"_id":"285380527","date":{"$date":"2018-07-03T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"22973623","reviewer_id":"88785178","reviewer_name":"Addie","comments":"This place is a fabulous find and an amazing value!

It's right in the heart of the Golden Mile and was close to the conference center that I needed. My only concerns were the upkeep of the furniture/kitchen. Some of it is worn or in disrepair. It seems people might be smoking in the unit as well (we are non-smokers so the smell was very obvious to us).

The bedding was super soft and the beds were very confortable! This place has the potential to be incredible! Beautiful floor to ceiling windows throughout. The bedroom with one bed could do with some blackout blinds as it gets very bright very early (6am!). Mohammed did provide a sleep mask and now I understand why! There are some small things that I think could be added to improve this condo! Things like adding a towel rack with hand towels in the bathrooms, fixing the drop in the floors in the bathrooms (stubbed my toe a few times at night), fixing the missing oven cover, fixing the drawer in the kitchen (as was mentioned to me after we arrived) and the broken handles on the bathroom cupboards would make a huge difference in this place! For the price, this place is definitely worth it. The location itself made it a fabulous stay. Other than a few minor details, we loved the place and would definitely stay again.

We loved the spacious open concept living area, the comfortable furniture and preparing meals in the kitchen. Great gathering spot for us to sit and recount our daily exploits.

The apartment unit itself was nice, and there are plenty of places to sleep. It was also nice to have a second bathroom with a shower and toilet in the back of the apartment.\r\n\r\nThe apartment complex rules are pretty strict and we found some of the rules regarding trash and using the \"servico\" elevator versus the social elevator a bit strange. I would also note that guests are not allowed in the apartment (perhaps for safety reasons?), which was not really an issue for us, but may be for some people.\r\n\r\nOverall, we had a positive experience, and enjoyed our stay!

My only regret is that we could not stay longer!   We stayed with another family so there were 8 of us in total, with four being teenagers.  The set up in this home was perfect, as our kids all slept downstairs, which gave them their own privacy and space.  The kitchen was well equipped (although a griddle would be a great addition!) and there were more than enough linens, including beach towels, for everyone.   The house was clean and has a great layout with amazing views of the ocean from almost every room.  You can not get any closer to the water!  The ocean is literally steps from the lower deck and for most of our stay, we had the entire beach to ourselves.  Sigh.  Just thinking  about it and I feel the stress melting away.......  This house is located about 5 minutes from the Polynesian Cultural Centre and is at the gateway to the various North Shore beaches and towns.  There is ample grocery shopping nearby.    I highly recommend this house if you want an authentic, relaxing, non-touristy Hawaiian experience."},{"_id":"1639551","date":{"$date":"2012-07-06T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"229954","reviewer_id":"1576887","reviewer_name":"Carol","comments":"Fabulous house and brilliant outlook.\r\nReally well equipped house.\r\nOnly negative was traffic noise from second bedroom upstairs"},{"_id":"3787665","date":{"$date":"2013-03-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"229954","reviewer_id":"4693593","reviewer_name":"Jessica","comments":"How was just as described and very clean.

The location was wonderful - right on the ocean. The waves lulled us to sleep when we turned off the air in just the master bedroom. We closed the door and kept the AC on in the rest of the house. We spent much time outside.  There was something for everyone… and more! We used kayaks, life jackets in different sizes, floating rings, beach and sand toys, places to wash off sand, places to sit in the shade or the sun, beach towels, fins and snorkels, a grill, and three different outside lanais. Inside we enjoyed a well equipped kitchen, plenty of beds and towels, the decor as a collection of art and items of interest, the book collection with the ability to trade, and the book with expectations and additional activities listed.  We also liked the guest book as it is fun to see where people are from who stay there.  The people in the little stores across the street were very friendly and we shopped there for last day souvenirs!  We found a place to snorkel down by the Hauuka public beach just about a 1/4 mile away and some hiked a trail just up the road. We used this home as a family vacation spot so three generations could be together and yet go off and explore as desired. This worked very well!

The home was well equipped with everything we needed, very clean and tastefully decorated with local artwork; it truly felt like home. The location was absolutely ideal for us being a walk or short drive away from scenic hikes, snorkeling, paddle boarding. There is a reef just off the shore where you kayak to and swim with sea turtles. A munk seal swam onto shore just a few houses down from us. It was easy for us to visit the tourist hotspots of Waikiki or drive up to North Shore to catch some waves. We will definitely stay here again on our next trip to Oahu.

Good location, just a few minutes walk from Bolhão station in a quiet area. It would have been a five star stay, but there was a major problem and some minor ones. The apartment is on the 4th floor with quite high steps and the elevator worked two days out of eight. Adriano called the company to fix it, but it didn’t last. The second time they didn't come at all.  Moreover the apartment is sort 'unfinished' maybe because Adriano has recently started to rent that flat. There was a fire extinguisher, a first aid box and every house appliance as microwave, coffe machine, toaster etc. but no dishcloths or kitchen paper. The main problem was the presence of just one little hook to hang the towels in the bathroom and no coathangers for our jackets and stuff so we had to be very creative and find all sorts of ways to hang many wet towels etc. Plus 3 windows (especially the one in the bathroom) can't be open: you would have to climb on something (dangerous) and still not be able to reach them. As for the 'essentials', we found 3 rolls of toilet paper for our week stay (3 people for a week and an extra one for 4 days) and we had to ask twice to have extra one. That said, the apartment in itself, the style of the furniture, the layout   (mind your head!) and the view are all beautiful so we hope that with some improvements Adriano will get many 5-star reviews!"},{"_id":"278943439","date":{"$date":"2018-06-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"23066385","reviewer_id":"55763187","reviewer_name":"Jeong Min","comments":"중심지에서 조금 멀긴 하지만 포르투가 워낙 작아서 도보로 걸어서 잘 다녔어요! 숙소에 엘리베이터도 있고 시설도 너무 깨끗하고 좋습니다. 넓고 침대도 깨끗하고 취사도구도 완벽하게 구비되어 있어요! 벗 에어컨이나 선풍기가 없어서 한 여름에는 더울거 같아요! 화장실도 깨끗하고 세심한 소품들도 너무 좋았습니다 :)\n\nIt is a little far from the center but Porto is so small that I walked on foot!

However you may hear our kids from the adjacent backyard playing in our family pool after 5:30 pm and on weekends.  I also offer ISR swim survival lessons out of our pool Monday through Friday from 3:30pm until 5:30pm. Drowning prevention is a main concern for our children here in Hawaii as we are surrounded by water and I am truly proud of what I do. You are always welcome to come and observe my lessons and I would be happy to teach your child for FREE for the duration of your stay. While you cannot see our pool from your private backyard you are able to hear my little students who are working hard to learn to save their lives should they ever find themselves in the water alone. While many of them are happy swimmers, there are always a few who cry at various degree and can be heard from your part of the house.

Reny had beach towels we could grab and even beach toys for the kids. We were able to bbq on the grill and hang outside on the back deck in the evenings. And the washer and dryer was super handy when coming back with wet beach clothes. Even though it was on the property with the main house, it was tucked away and felt super private. There was a lot of street parking available as well. If you are looking for a relaxing spot outside of Waikiki and Honolulu, this place is perfect. It is near the beach with lots of hikes nearby.

Apartment very noisy (uninsulated windows (one closed with a twirling baton !) : noises and cold wind from outside coming in all the time, so bedroom may be cold at night (due to bad windows); but, oh yes, heating blanket with a big old blood stain and brown dirty \"rings\" around...). Apart may also be overheated if heating is suddenly boosted (especially in the middle of the night). Neighbor unkind. Mrs.NOELLE does not know what conviviality and friendliness means : cold welcome (5 mn ! no instruction about wastes, no maps, no documentation, nothing..., no welcome present as it is recommended. We had one for the owner but eventually kept it for us) and 5 sec. good bye (obviously did not want to waste her \"business\" time). We were about to take an (Email hidden by Airbnb) plaint made to AirBnB =\u003e 50% refund."},{"_id":"12486655","date":{"$date":"2014-05-04T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2310445","reviewer_id":"11928045","reviewer_name":"Gregorio","comments":" Amy was kind and thoughtful.

The building reeked of weed the whole time I was there, so be aware if you have any aversion to that sort of thing. \nAmy was lovely and a very communicative host, but the apartment hadn't been cleaned properly when I arrived; I had to clean the bath out myself before being able to use it and the sink in the kitchen was full of grease.

The Eixample is the most cosmopolitan area of Barcelona, with tons of stores (you will find many supermarkets and pharmacies very close by). The area very well connected with all kinds of public transport that take you from one end of the city to the other in no time. The main touristic attractions of this district are the Sagrada Familia, La Pedrera, the Casa Mila, Plaza de Catalunya and Passeig de Gràcia.","notes":"The studio comes with one set of bedlinen and towels.

It was clean, comfortable, and the location is very convenient, just half a block down from the subway entrance. Alina was a gracious host. She waited until the wee hours to meet me in person, since my flight arrived late. When I got there, she had made the bed up for me, knowing I would be tired from a long day of travel. There were plenty of fresh clean towels in the bathroom, and just enough in the kitchen - tea, some drinks in the fridge, etc. - to make me feel at home. The only thing that was a little tricky was the wifi, which works a bit differently from some hotels, in that you have to unplug it so it doesn't overheat and then make sure it's plugged back in so it doesn't lose power. My devices didn't seem to be able to quite stay connected consistently and my iPad never connected at all, but Alina mentioned she'd never had that issue before, so it might have just been my iPad! She was very sweet and offered to bring her laptop by so I could get online without interruption, but I was able to manage for the most part! I would recommend Alina as a host and I would be glad to stay in her place again.

In the past, we stayed at boutique hotels in the area but decided to give Airbnb a try. This Studio apartment is pretty typical of the area - older buildings with some remodeling done, small spaces, facing a bustling street below - so things just feel old but the place is smartly/tastefully furnished to maximize space \u0026 the neighborhood offers great eating \u0026 shopping options (Trader Joes!) \u0026 terrific transportation convenience within easy walking distance!

There were a lot of restaurants, bars, and grocery stores within walking distance.  We weren't too far from Levain as well so it was easy to get cookies and not have to wait in line during the weekdays ;).

The airco also did not work properly, but at the reception they were very helpfull and always willing to came and repair it. It is also a pitty that the kids playground lies in the sun between 8:30 am and 3 pm, just could not use it at all. The very positive points of the apartment is that it is really spatious, has a wonderful location and is very easy accesible by public transport.

However, the apartment itself did not live up to our expectations. We felt that the Airbnb photos were very misleading. Future renters should know that the apartment is really quite small - for a group of more than 4 or so it would be very cramped. The photos were obviously taken with a wide-angle lens and lots of extra lighting. It's not a brand-new building and it's somewhat worn in some places, and one of the bedrooms has a plastic sliding door that doesn't close all the way, another doesn't have a secondary exit (window/door) for fire escape. There was a pile of garbage by the back door, including a discarded computer, broken furniture, and broken glass. One of our party found a bug and a hair on her mattress, though the house was otherwise clean. The walls to the apartment next door were thin and neighbors were playing music until after midnight.\n\nEssentially, for flexible travelers okay with basic accommodations in a fantastic location, this would be a great place.

I would not suggest a group of more than 8 people staying here. We arrived to the house to find that the parking spots were completely covered in snow and ice, which we had to shovel ourselves with one plastic shovel. One of our three cars were damaged in the process because of the icy snow. On top of that we were almost locked out one night because the back door's lock was broken (not our fault) and the front door's lock was extremely loose and then broke because of it. The Wi-Fi was terrible and I noticed several reviews about it, this is upsetting because all of us did not have service the entire time unless we connected to a nearby cafes.  Clearly there is little maintenance done on this apartment, and clearly nobody makes sure its in pristine condition before guests from another country stay in it."}]}

In Sok Kwu Wan town you can find a few local stores where they sell simple snacks and drinks. There's no convenience stores on this side of the island but numbers of reputed waterfront seafood restaurants. We have our favourites and will gladly share our local knowledge to make your stay more enjoyable. They all face to the west so waterfront sunset meals can be spectacular (see photos). Lamma island is geographically divided into 2 almost even parts. We are situated in the centre providing great hiking to the remote southern section with its remote white sand beaches and Hong Kong's only Green Sea Turtle breeding sanctuary.  The north of the island (Yung She Wan) boasts a larger population with shops, banks, organic food stores, restaurants and bars about a 50 minute hike on a paved (concrete) path. There’s no inter-island ferry between the south and the north of the island","notes":"Living on an island just 35 minutes by ferry to one of the busiest cities in the world has upsides and down.  We do not have any local supermarkets, so ensure you have a daily supply of basics. Obviously we are prepared and usually have most 'stuff' that you would need. Since we are away from the main path, getting to the house can be tricky. We will send you a map to show you how to get to the house from Sok Kwu Wan pier later.","transit":"There are no roads on Lamma Island. There is a beautiful 5 km bike ride to the remote southern beaches and Green Sea Turtle hatchery. Additionally, there are many easy, moderate and difficult hiking trails that will keep the outdoors person entertained for days.  The ferry to Hong Kong Island (Central \u0026 Aberdeen) departs every 90 minutes (approx) from Sok Kwu Wan and about every 45 minutes from Yung Shue Wan (the northern ferry terminal).","access":"Bedroom and adjacent bathroom (including bath), you are most welcome to use all common areas including the G/F lounge, kitchen and outdoor garden.

Ideal location.   thanks Oriel!"},{"_id":"243410085","date":{"$date":"2018-03-16T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"23171144","reviewer_id":"46674291","reviewer_name":"Nicole","comments":"Oriel is a fabulous host. He was super friendly and responsive and met us at the apartment to show us around.\n\nThe apartment itself is in a fabulous location with great views over to Darling Harbour and easy walk to nearby cafes and city shopping. It has a gym and pool.\n\nCompared to hotels around it’s an absolute bargain. There’s a hefty cleaning fee but assuming that stays the same no matter how long you stay. We only stayed one night so proportionally it was a lot but if you stayed over a longer period the per night rate would be less. Even so it was still very economically priced.\n\nIt’s fully furnished but otherwise empty, and although not absolutely brand new it’s in great condition and clean and tidy.

If you want to be close to Darling Harbour this place is perfect as its roughly a 5-10minute walk down the road depending on your speed. Its also central enough to walk to The Rocks, Circular Quay, Hyde Park, Sky Tower, and shops, all roughly 20mins and if you're coming home late or with bags of shopping the public transport costs are reasonable. There is traffic noise but not anything I wouldnt expect in such a central city location and the apartment is several stories up so the noise is not excessive.

It is $20.00 per night but you do at least get to lark in an underground parking-lot. \n\nThe place had a very, very strong smell of chemicals but was clean. Once we started to put our food into the fridge we realized that the fridge was broken so we contacted Michael and he suggested that we could stay at another apartment within the same building. The other place was much nicer and had pretty much everything we needed, except for a first aid kit. There was also not one in the entire building. \n\nThe shower pressure was really intense.

It was only a short visit but Jake was so accommodating throughout my stay. He was flexible with check in times and made sure he was home to let me in. The apartment is STUNNING. Light filled clean apartment by the water, short walk to see the harbour bridge along the bay. Very spacious room with large wardrobe, desk and fan (summer in Sydney!)  Kitchen has everything you need, very clean and stylish bathroom too. The street comes off Glebe point road so while very quiet and peaceful you are only a short walk from cafes, bars, transport options and supermarkets. Would definitely stay again and recommend to other airbnb users.

A great location in Ipanema on a quiet street. Comfortable bed with air conditioning throughout the apartment. The wifi worked great. Marcello was also wonderful to work with. He called to check in throughout my stay to see if there was anything I needed. He was accommodating and flexible with the check in and departure time. I've been to Rio 6 times and this is the apartment I will always rent."},{"_id":"81851103","date":{"$date":"2016-06-25T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2324694","reviewer_id":"27159138","reviewer_name":"Marcelo","comments":"The host canceled this reservation 49 days before arrival.
