We had gone into the city not really knowing what to do, and Denis sat with us for a good 15 minutes describing in detail some of his favorite places and the best times to go. Both Alexia and Denis were fluent in English and French, and we would engage in lively discussions on anything from politics to vegetarian recipes to Mario Kart (be warned: Alexia is prepared to defend her championship title on the last one!) On the flip side, they are also perfectly fine giving you space whenever you wish to rest or simply avoid social interaction.\nAs for the listing itself, parking was readily available on the street and the location was an easy 10 minute walk to the nearest subway station. Bathroom and bedrooms were clean, and the wifi connection was good. The apartment is in a quiet residential neighborhood with no traffic noise, and there are no pets in case any guests might have allergies.

If you need complete silence and privacy, this house may not be for you. A colony of wild chickens live in the neighborhood, and they can make noise in the morning.  Please do not park across the street where \"No Parking\" signs are, or you may get parking tickets. Do not use or block the driveway going up on the left side of the house as this belongs to a different property owner. This property is in a tropical environment, any food you leave out will attract ants. We provide ant sprays and traps upon request. If this bothers you, this unit may not be right for you.","transit":"There are bus lines that runs on 10th ave in Palolo/Kaimuki, but having a car is recommended for this location.","access":"You have your own assigned parking to park your car with private entrance to your unit.  You have your own washer/dryer in this unit. There is another unit downstairs (2bed/1bath) which is similar to this unit, also available for rent.","interaction":"The owners live about 5 min away in the neighborhood so we are available to answer your questions or help in any way.

The various 24 hr doormen were really friendly despite our language barrier.  There is also one of the locations where you could purchase in advance tickets to the Christ the Redeemer train across the street.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the walls are a little thin; an upstairs neighbor (or outside somewhere) was doing construction and we constantly heard a drill running or somebody hammering something in the mornings.\r\n\r\nI love a hot shower with plenty of water, but the water heater is built into the shower head in this bathroom and not so powerful.

However, we did not ask Marcela about this during our stay because we didn't think it worth the bother for our short stay - so she very well might've fixed it if we asked, and that's on us.

It looks like it has been cheaply and hastily furnished for Airbnb use with the bare minimum and nobody ever lived or planned to live there.\r\nOn arrival, the host was not there. The keys were left with the doorman who did not speak English. Luckily we had a friend with us who spoke Portuguese, otherwise it could have been quite a problem.\r\nThe shower is absolutely terrible. It's one of those flimsy electrical showers that warm up water as it flows through. Therefore, we had to choose between proper water flow or warm water, both was not an option. We went for the middle and ended up having showers with a pathetic, weak lukewarm stream of water. Also no hot water in the bathroom sink. The air conditioning made so much noise that the neighbors complained and warned us that it might catch fire (!).\r\nThere were absolutely no essentials in the apartment, except 3 small bars of soap. There was only 1 electrical outlet near the bed, so not exactly a \"laptop friendly workspace\" either (we had to take turns using the outlet!).\r\nOn the plus side, the location is indeed fantastic. It's right in the heart of Ipanema, with tons of nice shops and restaurants around.  The beach is only a 5 minute walk away. It also feels very safe, even very late at night. \r\nWe would recommend this place to travellers who want a great location but don't plan on spending much time in the apartment (or showering!)."},{"_id":"100968705","date":{"$date":"2016-09-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1304552","reviewer_id":"15265298","reviewer_name":"Sara","comments":"Marcela fue muy correcta, amable y puntual.

É uma espécie de Jk.\nÉ silencioso para dormir, apesar de localizado em rua movimentada, a janela dá para a lateral e fundos. \nAchei estranho anunciarem \"TV a cabo\", quando existe ligação da net apenas com acesso aos canais usuais da TV aberta. \nO apartamento é interessante para ficar em casal durante alguns dias. O ponto alto, realmente, é a localização.

The flat is in an excellent location; easy walking distance from attractions, but also in an area of great local bars and shops. Many happy times watching the world go by, and the football, at Cafe Java.

Die Dachterasse ist sehr schön und groß, aber leider konnten wir sie aufgrund des Wetters nicht so richtig nutzen. Von der Straße oder von irgendwelchen Nachbarn hört man nicht viel, so dass man auf jeden Fall einen ruhigen Schlaf hat. Einzig das Bett war mir etwas zu weich, aber für ein paar Tage geht auch das. Die KOmmunikation mit Catia hat problemlos funktioniert. Sie antwortete auf (Hidden by Airbnb) Nachrichten sehr schnell und hat uns unten an der Straße empfangen, so dass der Check in problemlos war.

The beaches are just around the corner and plenty of shops to buy food/drink.  Teddy's Burgers on the ground floor was the BEST!\r\n\r\nThe view of Diamond Head from the room's balcony is FAB and you can see the water and beach too. Definitely loved the views from the room.\r\n\r\nNote that the bar located on the 2nd level can be loud at night but I closed the balcony doors which mostly shut out the noise. (I mean, it's Waikiki...there'll be noise at night). \r\n\r\nRob met me at the front entry when I checked in and was great at getting me settled in. He was also very fast in responding to a question about the room and was very approachable.\r\n\r\nThis apartment is good if you are a solo traveller (possibly a couple, but you would need to be comfortable in a studio-sized place), and want to stay for a few days in the quieter part of town.  The features in the place are a bit worn, but everything worked and it was perfectly fine for me and I enjoyed my stay here.

Mark was very easy to communicate with and very helpful. I liked just having a key code to open the room instead of an actual key. We loved the view from the 10th floor community balcony. We watched a few sunsets up there. Spectacular. We stayed in room 805 the first night. There was a small problem with the room, which was not Mark's fault at all, and unfortunately there would not be a Technician out to fix it for a couple days. I thought it was no big deal and we would carry on but to our surprise Mark offered to switch us to room 811 across the hall in the same Hotel. We were amazed by his generosity and very grateful! Both rooms are very nice and clean and well stocked. Both rooms had Beach gear, like boogie boards, flippers, snorkeling gear etc. But room 811 has a view over the Honolulu Zoo and Diamond Head and of course Waikiki Beach. If you stay at one of Mark's rooms at the Waikiki Grand Hotel we would definitely recommend getting one with a view. The location of this hotel is awesome. One block from the Beach! Across the street from the Honolulu Zoo! 7 minute bus ride on the #2 bus to Diamond Head, which is a great hike! Spectacular views! Get there early they open at 6am. 30 minute bus ride, with great views along the way, to Hanauma Bay on Bus #22. The best snorkeling experience on the island I'm sure. Also if you stay on the #22 bus for a little longer, past Hanauma Bay is the Sea Life Park bus stop and if you cross the road there then you will find a little place call Makapu'u Beach! This is a very secluded beach. When we went there was only maybe 10 people on the beach. Very scenic! There is a great restaurant on the corner near the Waikiki Grand called Lulu's, which has great breakfast at decent prices and also has a large section overlooking the beach. Also on the first floor of the Waikiki Grand is Teddy's Burgers. They have a very good burger. On the second floor of the Waikiki Grand is night club called Hulu's. Hulu's had a great show the Saturday night we were there. All and all we loved the location of this hotel. The fact that it is at the very end of Waikiki Beach made if feel less crowded. Its a phenomenal location for sure. Oh and there is Diamond Head Luau which is a 10 minute walk from the Waikiki Grand Hotel. That was a blast. Great food and fire dancing and everything you can think of that a Luau would have. Amazing. Things to avoid are the taxis! Wow $50 to get from the airport to Waikiki. We downloaded the Uber app and asked (Hidden by Airbnb) directions using the bus to..."},{"_id":"208064852","date":{"$date":"2017-10-30T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13063671","reviewer_id":"49144316","reviewer_name":"Charles","comments":"Great unit that suited our needs perfectly!  The private deck is great for relaxation or head up to the 10th floor for a wide-open experience.  We appreciated that there were beach chairs / boogie boards available to use.\n\nAlso, this unit is convenient to everything you could ever need, but allows you to avoid the crowds.  Make sure to check out Mimi's Empanadas just around the corner on Cartwright!  Also, be sure to look for free parking on Monsarrat Ave.\n\nWill definitely stay again on our next trip!"},{"_id":"214124877","date":{"$date":"2017-11-24T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13063671","reviewer_id":"9857464","reviewer_name":"Corey","comments":"Beautiful view!"},{"_id":"232002072","date":{"$date":"2018-02-03T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13063671","reviewer_id":"76243926","reviewer_name":"Chris","comments":"When we arrived in Honolulu on Jan 25, 2018 we called the guest host from the airport as we had been instructed to do. We were shocked and horrified to be told they did not have a reservation for us. This in spite of the fact I had received a communication from them earlier in the day telling me how the key pad was coded. \nBy the time we arrived at the Waikiki Grand (which is where his Airbnb is located) they had obtained a hotel room with an ocean view for us. We were told our reservation “didn’t make it from one system to another “ \nWe were told it was an upgrade but looking at the pictures of Mark’s Airbnb, we had reserved and paid in Sept 2017, it was not. It was marginally adequate- at least we weren’t on the street!!\nOnce we asked they supplied us with an induction cooktop, a pot, frying pan (that didn’t work on induction), some utensils, dish towels, beach towels and mats\nAll we wanted was the room we reserved! We expected more from Airbnb based on our previous experiences! This has clouded our view of Airbnb and not sure we will use it again! \nIn hindsight I should have contacted Airbnb immediately for support, rather than waiting until our vacation was over"},{"_id":"238489663","date":{"$date":"2018-02-25T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13063671","reviewer_id":"30445845","reviewer_name":"Rahn","comments":"Great location!

It was beautiful and definitely worth it. We were able to wake up and go to bed looking out at diamond head and the beach. It’s definitely something worth experiencing and remembering. But! After our first night, the neighboring guests next to us and above us were loud. At one point, the people next to us seemed to be arguing for a couple hours early in the morning which woke us up and the people above us kept moving what sounded like a table and chairs across the floor. It caused our room to creak with the movement throughout the day. The restaurant below us on the second floor also played their music loud which made things difficult when you’re trying to go to bed early to get an early start the next day. Other then things that were out of our real control, the room was nice and the bed was really comfortable. It was so soft and welcoming after a busy day of exploring the town.

The employee on the lobby said: - it was another mistake you do not suppose to have parking spot because you did not warn manager while you check in.

Jean-Michel was a great host.  First, the condo is right in the heart of Waikiki and easily in walking distance of the entire area.  Easily walked to the beach and to get drinks with friends at the Sheraton Edge, the Royal Hawaiian and to LuLu's for breakfast the next morning.\r\n\r\nThe condo was spotlessly clean and even included drinks in the fridge, toiletries, and laundry detergent for the in-unit laundry.  The kitchen comes stocked with pots, pans, and utensils.  You can buy grocery items at the small market on the first floor.\r\n\r\nThe building is great also.  It is very quiet and private, but also includes an outdoor pool, hot tub, and tennis courts.  The residents I ran into were all very nice.\r\n\r\nLastly, working with Jean-Michel was great.  We met him at this music studio once we got our rental car.  He promptly gave us the keys and gave us in-depth instructions on where to park and how to access the unit.  He even let us stay late since there wasn't a reservation for the next day.\r\n\r\nOverall, a great stay.  When I come back to Oahu, I'll definitely be staying here.\r\n\r\n-Zach"},{"_id":"85075404","date":{"$date":"2016-07-10T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13069840","reviewer_id":"72414406","reviewer_name":"Lois","comments":"Couldn't  fault host extremely  helpful.Great location everything we wanted close  by.

He took the time to give us a walkthrough, showing us how to operate the washer/dryer, TV, wi-fi, how to access pool, etc. He had thoughtfully provided a fruit platter which was EXTREMELY welcome after our journey, along with tea, coffee, etc. The apartment was perfect for us, with a large single bedroom and separate living room and kitchen. Jean-Michel also provided washroom amenities as well as liquid for the washing machine. It was winter in Hawai'i, so we REALLY appreciated the heated pool and jacuzzi. Our LO normally struggles with colder temperatures, so he absolutely loved the pool this time. The apartment was perfectly located, 5-10 mins walk to the main strip, with access to shops, restaurants, and (most importantly!) Waikiki beach. If you don't have a car, it's a short bus ride to the shopping mall and Oauhu zoo (opposite directions!).

It is also steps away from the beach. Jean-Michel was an awesome host - he waited till late at night to receive us and showed us around the apartment. He always kept in touch and proactively tried to help with our needs. We needed a screwdriver to change batteries for our baby's toy and Jean-Michel dropped off a set the same night. He also stocked up tea and coffee for us, provided us clean linens, and laundry supplies. An awesome apartment, with an even more awesome host, there is really no better way to do Waikiki!"},{"_id":"215621975","date":{"$date":"2017-11-30T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13069840","reviewer_id":"49770487","reviewer_name":"Naoto","comments":"This is 2nd times staying his condominium.

He is a very good communicator. Replies to you within minutes if not seconds although doesn’t bother you if you don’t reach out first. He is very friendly and easy to deal with.  He provided our family with everything a family with young children and infant would need. Clean place, plenty of sleeping (mattresses), a bed with super comfy memory foam mattresses  or something like which was awesome since I have back pains. I slept like a baby during entire vacation. I am now shopping for the same mattress for home :-). Also a crib for a baby, high chair, 2 strollers, beach mats, beach toys, snorkeling gear, even a backpack for hiking and a cooler. Plenty of kids books, DVDs and BlueRays disks, cable TV, activity sets for kids. Basically everything. It’s like we never left our house. Ton of pots and pans for cooking. The kitchen was fully stocked. Bathroom clean and was stocked with clean towels, beach towels, shampoos and soaps and toothpaste that would probably last us for a month. Also cleaning supplies and laundry detergent. We didn’t have to buy anything. The place is very close to everything in Waikiki. We have walked to Waikiki/Honolulu Zoo. It was a nice short walk with kids and stroller along the Waikiki beach. Also DeRussy Park is 4 min away walking. We didn’t use our rental car for 2 days at all as we were exploring Waikiki area by foot as everything is so close. But the apartment itself is not in the noisy area. There is nice pool and barbecue area that we took advantage of in the evenings. Barbecue grills are free (not coin-operated) unlike many other hotels in Waikiki have. Also Jean-Michel provides with a free designated parking spot. We definitely will be back again. Thank you so much for making our first AirBnB experience and our first  Hawaii trip truly unforgettable and wonderful."},{"_id":"235458137","date":{"$date":"2018-02-16T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13069840","reviewer_id":"162170070","reviewer_name":"Sato","comments":"とても良かった\n言うことなしです!"},{"_id":"240736327","date":{"$date":"2018-03-05T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13069840","reviewer_id":"71476930","reviewer_name":"A","comments":"3歳になったばかりの子どもと生後5か月の子どもを連れて家族4名でお世話になりました｡ﾍﾞﾋﾞｰﾍﾞｯﾄﾞ､ﾊｲﾁｪｱ､子ども用の遊具､ｴｸｽﾄﾗﾍﾞｯﾄﾞ等が全てあり､とても快適でした｡お部屋が広くﾘﾋﾞﾝｸﾞでも十分に寝るｽﾍﾟｰｽがあったため､夜中の授乳も家族を起こすことなく出来ました｡\n\n立地はとてもよく､主要ﾎﾃﾙやｼｮｯﾋﾟﾝｸﾞｾﾝﾀｰ､ABCｽﾄｱなどには徒歩で行くことが出来ました｡お部屋にあった洗濯機と乾燥機のお蔭で､子どもたちが出す大量の汚れた洋服が溜まる事もありませんでした｡\n生活に必要なものは一通りお部屋に揃っているため､長期滞在する方や小さなお子さんが居て部屋に居る時間が長い方には特におすすめです｡\n\nﾎｽﾄの方はﾏﾒに連絡をくださり､何かあればすぐに対応して下さり安心です｡"},{"_id":"242930718","date":{"$date":"2018-03-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13069840","reviewer_id":"149406618","reviewer_name":"Dominic","comments":"Jean-Michel is an exceptional host.

We didn't have to purchase any beach/pool gear because he had it all. Jean-Michel set up extra air mattresses ahead of time (per our request) and made up all the beds with clean sheets, pillows, and blankets. The apartment itself is not that huge, but when you're in the heart of Waikiki, there's really no need to stay indoors--and the unit has a little balcony where you can enjoy some fresh air.

Anna es una persona tranquila y accesible, me dio indicaciones de como llegar a su casa, y luego me explicó como usar las cosas de la cocina y las llaves; asimismo, en su casa tienes mucha privacidad y comodidad, la habitación es limpia y ordenada, la cama es cómoda, el baño es muy limpio y ordenado, está a unos seis metros de la habitación pero no incomoda la distancia porque tienes privacidad. Lo único a tomar en cuenta es que no hay elevador en el edificio y son varias escaleras las que hay que subir para llegar al piso, entonces eso hace un poco cansada la subida y bajada, y peor si vas con maletas cargadas que es lo que me pasó a mí, pero por lo demás el lugar es muy recomendado, y si no llevas mucha carga o no te molesta subir escaleras, es excelente."},{"_id":"116144038","date":{"$date":"2016-11-28T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13079105","reviewer_id":"42821786","reviewer_name":"Patricia","comments":"Visite de Barcelone totalement à pied c est parfait logement agréable ancien logement manque d insonorisation"},{"_id":"121618363","date":{"$date":"2016-12-18T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13079105","reviewer_id":"33816251","reviewer_name":"Sandra","comments":"Ana nos acogió bien desde el principio y no tuvimos ningún problema en el apartamento , nos encantó porque el piso está en el centro del maravilloso barrio de gracia !

Anna even offered me after-sun when I had burnt myself in the sun :) honestly they're wonderful people (who speak Catalan, Spanish AND English, and I think Borja speaks French), the flat is great, the room is comfortable and cosy. I felt my partner and I had plenty of privacy and space. It is well-located in Gracia, one of my favourite neighbourhoods. It is situated near the metro and local amenities (and if you fancy a stroll into the center it's around 30 or so mins). I was really hesitant about sharing a place with hosts as I've never done it before, but if every experience is like this, there is nothing to worry about.

Why? It is a spacious airy apartment, ideal for two people, well equipped and nicely furnished, and the landlord has been a joy to deal with on each occasion. The residents of the other apartments have always been friendly and welcoming which is a plus.\n\u0009The raison detrê of this apartment however is its location. \nLocal buses and shops are a 5 min stroll, with the main shopping centre of Mosman a short bus ride or 20 min walk. Mosman has all one can want in terms of shopping, two small supermarkets, and delightful local shops where we have always found friendly and excellent service, unlike the UK. The library is ideal for wi fi should you need it. In addition there is a local free bus (2 min away) which will take you shopping, to Balmoral beach and Taronga Zoo.  \nThe Ferry stop to the City is but a 15 min walk or 2 min bus ride.\nWe cannot recommend this apartment highly enough, for either a short or long stays. We will continue to return here as long as we are able, as it now become home from home. \n"},{"_id":"141381014","date":{"$date":"2017-04-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1310308","reviewer_id":"17954206","reviewer_name":"Corrie","comments":"This apartment is a gorgeous space and in a great location.

As a family of three is had everything we could possibly need. We were very comfortable and really settled in for a few months. This place is really more equipped for shortterm stays however.\n\nThe big, soaking tub was really lovely and the leafy, breezy outlet was beautiful. The proximity to the local shops, park and waterfront at Mosman Bay made life really easy. The ferry wharves nearby were easy to walk to and connections very frequent for Sydney. The bus was harder to get- but by no means impossible.\n\nBalmoral beach is very close and we spent lots of time there. The bus stop to get the bus to the beach is a fair walk away- but worth it to avoid the nightmare parking situation in summer! Mind you- the drive isn't far at all, so if you get lucky that is the easiest option.\n\nThe walk down to Sirius Cove dog beach is lovely and the swimming there is not bad either. You can continue your walk along the headline all the way around to Athol Bay for even better swimming or Taronga Zoo entry.\n\nWe only had trouble finding a street parking spot maybe twice in almost three months- so that was pretty manageable I'd say.\n\nThe Orpheum Theatre is delightful and the shopping on Military Road east was great.\n\nBeware there is no wifi, microwave or toaster! It's a bit like taking a step back in time. But we loved it all the same."},{"_id":"222144360","date":{"$date":"2017-12-29T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1310308","reviewer_id":"8259208","reviewer_name":"Lisa","comments":"The host canceled this reservation 27 days before arrival.

We were woken up by constant loud noises ( between 12am and 2:30am ) from the tenant family (apparently, who also rent and stay in the house but on a different floor or room). We had no choice but called Derek around 12:16am and later with SMS, but the situation was not under control. The tenant's kids kept speaking loudly and running around, we could not get any sleep between 12-2:30am at all.

Reached out to the host who said the router was in the upstairs stairway and that there was nothing he could do. Unexpectedly had to do some work that required wifi which caused an issue.\n\nSecond: Host is stingy about bathroom necessities. No hand towels or wash cloths, a nearly empty paper towel roll next to the sink with no replacement, no extra bath towels in case one gets dirty, a half empty hand soap next to the sink that ran out by the end of the trip, no extra toilet paper, etc. Felt strange that all the cabinets were empty instead of having extras.\n\nOverall, apartment was clean with a convenient passcode entry. Upstairs neighbors and airplanes were a bit noisy but did not bother us too much. Location is great as it is a short walk to the beach. Rockaways are fun in general with great food (tacoway beach!) and different choices of live music on the boardwalk. This is a solid rental and we had a good time but it ended up feeling a bit pricey due to the amenities situation described above."},{"_id":"193707144","date":{"$date":"2017-09-14T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13113064","reviewer_id":"143241827","reviewer_name":"Andrew","comments":"Great location, close to the beach, and surprisingly quiet.

Also, the kitchen is well stocked with any tools and appliances that you may need, which we appreciated. \n\nThere is only A/C in the bedrooms, but the common area has tons of screened windows and screened in doors to help cool off the house.   \n\nIn terms of location, the house is a short drive back to Hanalei with a few good dinner options (Hanalei Bay Pizzeria is good), and a couple of good eating options closer (totally recommend Sushi Girl).  \n\nOur whole group loved the house and we would totally stay here again!

Expect both tropical rain and lots of sunshine - it seems to change every few hours. Do not miss the 2 mile hike into Napoli Coast (bring a walking stick) and the sunset at the beach at the end of the road. Your pictures will be incredible. The house is fantastic for 6 adults. Lots of space in rooms and deck areas. The great room/kitchen is fantastic. Having laundry capability also is a nice touch. The beach is just 100 feet away and used by very few people. Snorkeling is ok but be very careful of rip tides - you must be a good swimmer. Go to safer coves for swimming. The small town of Hanalei is delightful and has nearly everything you need (except gasoline) including some good restaurants. The one way bridges from Hanalei to the house add to the ambiance of the journey but be careful at night."}]}

The following is a synopsis of our stay:\n\nLocation: Exceptional access to Waikiki as a whole. 15 minute walk to pretty much any restaurant. 10-15 minute walk to the beach.\n\nBuilding: As with many buildings in Waikiki, this condo building/hotel is definitely showing it’s age. It was, however, very safe and the security staff there were helpful with a key card issue and baggage storage. The unit itself was much nicer than the building.\n\nUnit: Much more recent renovation than the condo building itself. Essentially a hotel room with a small kitchenette and surprisingly good view of the ocean. Very functional space with AC, cable TV, coffee maker, mini-fridge and induction cook top/hot plate. Bathroom was small but functional. My one criticism was that cleanliness could be improved upon. The floors were a little sticky and the kitchen could have used another wipe down. No issues with bathroom/shower cleanliness.\n\nParking: $25/24 hours-yikes! It turns out the most lucrative business venture out there is operating a parking garage in Waikiki. We were able to find daily street parking it just took a little bit of work. \n\nGina: Possibly the most responsive AirBnB owner/manager out there. Nothing but good things to say. \n\nOn the whole, this is a good option for the budget traveller wanting to stay in Waikiki."},{"_id":"215439262","date":{"$date":"2017-11-29T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13146333","reviewer_id":"8572432","reviewer_name":"Charlotte","comments":"Très belle appartement conforme aux photos.

The building itself is a hotel and apartments for tourists but also residential. I must advise that several of the residents that stayed in the building appeared highly intoxicated (all times of day), smelling of marijuana and loud. This was undesirable and they hang around outside the building. I appreciate this is not to the fault of the host, but it is not ideal when you a paying and on holiday - especially if you have children. The road noise can be heard from the apartment but did not bother us. Finally, I was slightly disappointed in the cleanliness of the apartment. The bathroom especially.

This definitely colors the experience here. TL;dr is that the room itself was acceptable, with a great view and solid A/C, albeit wildly overpriced, there were definitely some things that made us feel unwelcome and uncomfortable. The first problem was the 4pm check-in. Our flight got in at 10am, putting us at the hotel around 11am. Despite reaching out almost a full week in advance, Gina denied us the opportunity to check in even a MINUTE early, and instead suggested we book the night before if we wanted to check in early, because the cleaning needed to be completed. This was a bit silly as if the unit was available the night before our stay, I can’t imagine that cleaning it that day was necessary. This just showed that the host isn’t that concerned for her guest’s travel experience and is looking to nickel and dime wherever she can. We walked around a bit, then hung out in the lobby bar while we waited. There is NO LOBBY at the building and the luggage storage ($10 per bag) is not locked or watched by the hotel front desk. Your stuff is not safe in there and there is no where comfortable to wait for your ridiculously late check-in. I literally went to the box at 3:59pm and our key still wasn’t in the box. Host showed up at 4:05pm with the keys. It also didn’t work the we got to the room, so had to go downstairs and wait in line for security to check our IDs and fix the keys. This all adds up for a NEGATIVE GUEST EXPERIENCE AND A CRAPPY START to a vacation. A couple other things people should know about this place: - The walls are paper thin. You will hear everything your neighbors do and say. - The water shuts off once a month for half a day. We were not informed of this when booking and plan to request a partial refund for that day. - The wi-fi doesn’t work, like at all. We were told to “turn the router off and back on” and it made zero difference. - The cable doesn’t work. TV constantly flickers and makes shuddering noises. - Host charges an $80 cleaning fee and does the cleaning herself. When I met her when she finally dropped the non-working keys off at 4:05pm, she mentioned that she cleans the rooms herself. So essentially, the $80 cleaning fee is a ridiculous tack on expense and you should figure it into the cost of the room, as its not like she is paying a service to clean for her. Ludicrous, greedy and shady. - Host has a long list of things she will charge you for if you fail to do (taking out trash, getting stains on towels, etc.) Just makes you feel more and more unwelcome. - The..."},{"_id":"281907703","date":{"$date":"2018-06-25T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13146333","reviewer_id":"25366857","reviewer_name":"Jong-Ah","comments":"번화가에서 아주약간 떨어져있지만 위치도 좋고 주변 편의시설도 아주좋아요 abc스토어랑  세븐일레븐 바로코앞에 있고 아침마다 일어나서 보이는 뷰가 정말 최고입니다 호스트의 응대도 아주빠르고 정확하며 친절해요!!"},{"_id":"287172108","date":{"$date":"2018-07-07T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13146333","reviewer_id":"195735158","reviewer_name":"Jorielle","comments":"Everything is perfect!

The room is definitely spacious enough for two—though the bathroom is a little small, especially the shower if you're tall. Be sure to keep the curtains closed during the day as the room gets very hot since the sun pours in all day. Even with the curtains closed, chocolates that we purchased early on in the trip and some cosmetics melted in the heat (in December nonetheless). If you are sensitive to noise, be warned that the a/c unit is quite loud and that there is a strange screeching sound that can be heard from the elevator or parking lot. All that being said, overall value was good being that the room is located conveniently and the process with Gina was very easy."},{"_id":"366987857","date":{"$date":"2019-01-03T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13146333","reviewer_id":"3694959","reviewer_name":"Vitaly","comments":"Nice location, great view, clean and easy.

Everything was within walking distance (beach, restaurants, luxury row, zoo etc), we managed to cover all of Waikiki from there on foot. Gina was very helpful and a great host. You get more  value for what you’re paying for this AIRBNB than you would for the ocean front hotels/resorts. It’s much cheaper and unless you’re spending your entire vacation inside your hotel room there’s really no need to spend more than necessary. There’s a plethora of things to do in Waikiki and beyond. I would recommend this place to anyone travelling to Waikiki."}]}

It is located very near to the ocean; ready to go swimming every day and night. Also it is perfect for jogging along the coast. In walking distance is the surf spot for surfing lessons and there is a great long white beach. Along the coast are great restaurants and bars to get food. Right on the other side of the apartment is a very nice and tasty bakery, not to mentioned the horse-driven greengrocer standing in front of this bakery.\r\n\r\nThe view from the balcony is much better, then you may expect from the pictures. There is a second view to the ocean to get a great feeling for the actual weather and the day.\r\n\r\nApartment: The apartment is in BEST shape. Everything is brand-new! Both bathrooms are in perfect conditions and very spacy. Both have showers to walk in. Both sleeping rooms have TV and very big built-in wardrobes. The kitchen has everything, you would need, including sharp knives and nice dishes. There is a separated washing room, where you may dry the towels.\r\n\r\nÁlvaro \u0026 Sílvia are doing a great job, keeping the apartment in perfect and clean conditions.\r\n\r\nThe most important thing for the kids: WLAN is very good! \r\n\r\nOur favorite as a tip:\r\nGo with the 500-Busline to the \"Parque da Arfandega\" and rent a tandem at Viegiuni ( (Website hidden by Airbnb) start from there back to the coast to the little ferry boat \"Flor do Gas\", which takes only people and bikes, cross the Douro to the Gaia-side of porto. Take a bike ride along the river and the coast to the little \"Capela do Senhor da Pedra\" at the beach. Turn back the same way but go on further to the “Cais de Gaia”. Take a break on the roof of the \"Porto Cruz\" building. Afterwards, for a climax, go all the way up to the upper level of the bridge \"Ponte Dom Luis I\", cross the river. The rest is a piece of cake, rolling downhill back to the rental shop at the cost. Back to the apartment with the 500-Busline.\r\n\r\nSummary: We did not want to leave and would like to come back in the near future, if possible …\r\n\r\n"},{"_id":"100811781","date":{"$date":"2016-09-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13153996","reviewer_id":"13327886","reviewer_name":"Justyna","comments":"Wir würden jederzeit in diese tolle Unterkunft zurück kommen.\r\nDie Wohnung ist super ausgestattet, hochwertige Einrichtung, es hat uns an nichts gefehlt.

There were only 2 of us but it is large enough to hold a couple more people (though only has 1 bathroom).\n\nTwo things to note: as stated in the description, the building is currently under construction. It was very loud for 2 days of the trip but we didn't hear it at all on the 3rd day. Keep that in mind if you choose to book while the construction continues.

Easy to access shops, the metro, restaurants, etc. The amenities are good. The kitchen, dinning area, and living room have basic furniture that will work for most travelers. The beds are a little stiff but there are worse places to lay your head. The bedroom with the ball lamps on the side table is very bright while the other bedroom is wonderfully dark. Temperature control is challenging since the only AC unit is in the dining area. Water temp fluctuates without adjusting the nozzle/valve, but that's probably building-wide. During our stay there was construction on our balcony so we woke up each morning to those sounds. We were instructed not to open the windows to avoid dust coming in. On the morning of checkout the next client came in at 7 AM. That was awkward. In summary, it's a nice place but this wouldn't be my first choice for the next visit to MTL.

Well, my colleague and I were very fortunate to have found Schwartz’s place! The location can not be beat, very central and close to two metro stations that made traveling a breeze. The building is traditional with a front gate and an elevator. The check is process was very smooth and the communication with Heike was very fast and efficient. The apartment is on the 2nd floor (some would say first!) and it is extremely bright and spacious. This is a high end accommodation that has been thoroughly renovated and everything was functional. Three  bedrooms ( two large ones and one smaller one) with two full bathrooms and a very large kitchen/dining/ living area. The large bedrooms are on opposite ends of the apartment and this provided complete privacy. The kitchen was fully equipped for coffee, cooking, wine glasses, nothing was missing and it felt like home. In addition there is a very nice terrace that can accommodate a large crowd, perfect for morning coffee or an evening drink. I recommend this place very highly if you are considering a stay in Barcelona!"}]}

Nisantasi is fabulous - lots of high end designer fashion stores, and Besiktas has endless lovely restaurants and cafes. The apartment is also a short walk to the Besiktas ferry, which has wonderful views on the Bosphorus to other great districts in Istanbul. The apartment was sparkling clean and had so much style which I can imagine comes from Tugba's great sense of style as a designer. It also next door to a small convenient store that keeps late hours, and around the corner from a big supermarket. As a host Tugba was very understanding and responsive and pleasant.

Fully double-glazed windows and bedroom windows are double-double glazed so no problem with road noise.  Although only on the first floor there is a small lift for those who may find it difficult to climb stairs with a suitcase.\n\nFor those interested, the apartment is directly opposite the Egyptian Museum.\n\nHeike was a friendly and efficient host and solved a problem with one of the keys overnight for us.\n\nWe really enjoyed our stay at Vela apartment and would recommend to others seeking a classy apartment in a great location in this amazing city.\n\n\n\n"},{"_id":"160436070","date":{"$date":"2017-06-14T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13165887","reviewer_id":"3978717","reviewer_name":"Mark","comments":"central location with great public transport close by.Wonderful ,stylish apartment with all you would want available for a short or long stay..Professional assistance from the owner and always willing to assist .The area made me feel like a local which I liked.."},{"_id":"181302081","date":{"$date":"2017-08-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13165887","reviewer_id":"46868097","reviewer_name":"S","comments":"We have used Airbnb for our last few family European holidays, so we have some but not a huge experience with Airbnb. \n\nThe host responded to my booking request very promptly and responded to my initial questions straight away.

We had a slight issue with the internet on day 2 which again was dealt with promptly and efficiently. \n\nThe apartment is tastefully decorated and appointed to a high standard and it was also very comfortable. We felt very much at home. \n\nOn the first night we noticed a little traffic noise  ( as was expected from a city centre location) but this was significantly minimized when the outer shutters and inner ornate shutters were closed. \n\nThe apartment is located in a lovely spot, very central but a block or so away from where the main tourist congregations.

The place itself was lovely - a studio apartment on the 3rd floor, a few steps away from many restaurants and other services, and close to the subway. This is the east village so there are also a lot of bars and people out and about. The bed was comfortable and fits 2 people. The bathroom was spacious in compared to other NY apartments. The storage space was sufficient for the normal amount of travel items for a 2-person trip. The stove and other kitchen appliances were very practical, we would cook our breakfast eggs, while enjoying coffee from Erica's Nespresso machine.

There are a lot of restaurants, bars, shops, the location really is ideal!\n\nIn terms of living conditions Erica is an excellent host, super reactive by message and thoughtful for her visitors’ stay: a visitor set (earplugs which are nice to have with the street noise, slippers for each guest), plenty of soap and bathroom products, a Netflix visitor account... \nI loved the comfy pillows, the cozy decoration and the very manhattan-y brick wall! There is also plenty of storage available in the closet for all your NY shopping.\n\nThe only trouble I had was with the stairs (3rd floor): I have a cane after a surgery and I couldn’t have brought my suitcase up without my bf’s help. (BF being a fluffy towel person he wasn’t a fan of the fouta towels in the bathroom, but I like the summery vibe!)\n\nI would definitely recommend staying in this adorable and cozy nest Erica has set up, and I will likely be checking it out for any future trip I might plan :)"}]}

The community is called Honokowai and is located south of Ka'anapali and north of Kapalua.  The neighborhood is a mixture of condominium complexes and residential single-family homes.  The complex is about 5 miles north of the town of Lahaina, a 50 minute drive from Kahului Airport.  Across the street there is there is a grocery store, a weekly farmers market, a deli and the well-known Maui roasted coffee shop \"Bad Ass Coffee\".","notes":"In addition to the rental fee, Hawaii State mandated 13.42% GET \u0026 TA tax will be collected separately through Airbnb’s resolution center.

However, to make the most of your time here, I highly, highly recommend renting a car. There are several taxi companies that service the West Maui Area.  Uber and Lyft are also becoming more popular but are not as readily available as they are in larger metropolitan areas.  To the best of my knowledge, Lyft and Uber are not permitted to pick up at Kahalui Airport at this time (the rules might have changed so you'll want to look into this if you are considering this option).","access":"Guests will be able to access the entire unit, communal coin-op washer/dryer, pool, BBQ area, and one parking spot.","interaction":"I am most readily available through the Airbnb messenger app (99% of the time I respond in less than an hour, please take into consideration time zone differences).

This unit was nearly perfect for us, in consideration that we were there for the atmosphere, not a fancy hotel experience. The view of course is unbeatable. If this unit were any closer to the ocean, it would have fish in it. It's in a smaller complex, with nobody above you. \r\n\r\nThe neighborhood is okay; appeared to be safe, and there are some eating/shopping options close by, but most restaurants and shops you may want to go to are a little further afield, but not more than a 3-5 minute drive (Kaanapali itself is about 10 minutes away, which is a good thing in my opinion). The road the complex is on is fairly busy, but not too noisy (most cars are going pretty slow here), see more below.\r\n\r\nThe complex itself is pretty old but appeared to be very well-maintained. There's a small beach adjacent to the complex that's okay for recreational bathing but not a destination in itself. The overall vibe was very private and intimate; a very friendly atmosphere. The pool was a huge added bonus for us; the kids wanted to use it practically every day. Honokowai Park was on the other side of the complex; we didn't go here, but the recon I did on a walk gave me the impression that the park was okay but nothing to write home about.\r\n\r\nThe overall noise level here was very minimal; no loud guests or screaming kids. There is some road noise in the front bedroom, and although I wasn't in that bedroom, it wouldn't have bugged me, and I'm a light sleeper. \r\n\r\nThe baths were very nice and almost resort-y; overall, they were very clean although the grout could use a good cleaning, just saying. The kitchen was more than adequate for our needs, and had quite a bit of storage space. We also used the barbecues on premise a couple of times; they're impeccably maintained.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that is a drawback to this place in my opinion is that the loft can get quite stuffy, even with the fans going full blast. We were there in August, and several nights up there were fine, some others were uncomfortable, and there was 2 nights where it was extremely hard to sleep up there.\r\n\r\nSo overall, this place is perfect if you value a tranquil atmosphere with a killer view, in a nice unit in a pleasant complex, at a fair price. If you have enough guests to where you have to utilize the loft, the weather may be a roll of the dice as to how comfortable it is."},{"_id":"97102694","date":{"$date":"2016-08-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13201601","reviewer_id":"83546782","reviewer_name":"Purnima","comments":"Angelica's apartment is excellent and the view is out of the world.

We loved the location and meeting fellow vacationers at the pool and BBQ. My recommendation would be to make sure you understand the condo does not have air conditioning but cools off nicely if you open the windows and turn on the fans. We slept with the windows open the entire time we were there and like one other reviewer mentioned you can hear the sounds of the ocean, birds whistling and light street traffic that acts as white noise but I would recommend bringing ear plugs if you are a light sleeper. Also the washer/dryer is down stairs (not inside the condo). This is a second floor condo so all you have to do is go downstairs and the property has a small pay washer and dryer room. It has a coin machine and you can buy detergent as well. The other thing I would recommend if you are trying to stay frugal is to purchase all your supplies at Costco after you leave the airport. We purchased everything except for meat because we figured we could purchase meat for BBQ at the local market but that was a big mistake. The local Markets do not have a good selection of meats and are much more expensive. Plan your meals and get everything at Costco. (Trash bags, baggies, paper plates, red cups, lots of bottled water, sports drinks also came in very handy). I would also recommend bringing or buying a midsize soft cover ice chest to carry around snacks and bottled water. We would freeze four or five bottles of water to use as our ice and load everything around that inside the cooler and came in very handy. I also brought a large Camelback back pack which I loaded with first aid stuff, bug spray, sunscreen, lip balm, neck towels, waterproof camera, sunglasses, hats and a blue tooth speaker and always filled the water bladder. This came in very handy when we hiked the seven pools thru the bamboo forest to the waterfall. Make sure to bring good hiking shoes (not flip flops) It rained on our way back down and was very slippery/muddy so if you don't like to get wet you should consider bringing a small umbrella or light plastic poncho. Like I mentioned Angelica's place is in a great location. The balcony overlooks the pool and ocean. The beach is steps away and turtles are visible from the balcony. We literally saw a turtle everyday we were there. (nine days). The blue tooth speaker came in very handy as well. I would wake my two kids up every morning to the song from Lilo and Stitch called \"Hawaiian Roller Coast Ride\" and they would wake to big smiles and a great attitude for all the adventures we had while on the island. Have a great time on the island. I would recommend Angelica's place and would love to go back again some..."},{"_id":"285114171","date":{"$date":"2018-07-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13201601","reviewer_id":"96361691","reviewer_name":"Susan","comments":"The view is amazing! So close to the ocean.  Sea turtles come to the rocks near the shore of the private beach. The condo is clean and modern, and the kitchen had all the utensils we needed. Highly recommend stopping at Costco for supplies prior to checking in.  Close walking distance to a fruit market, coffee shop and snorkeling supply store. The unit is a quick drive to public beaches and shopping. There is no AC, but we were here at the end of June, and the unit was comfortable.

Our family of four just returned from having stayed at this condo. You can't beat the access to the ocean and the pool is equally lovely. The décor here shows the extra care that Angelica has put into the condo - it is very stylish and comfortable. We found other guests and residents to be welcoming and free with local tips for places to eat and see. A number of restaurants and stores (including a full size grocery) are very near by. Short drives will get you to West Maui sites, including several good snorkeling or swimming beaches. The grilling area is clean and well maintained. That coupled with the fully equipped kitchen makes it easy to take meals at the condo. The lanai has great views of the pool and ocean and sunsets here are hard to beat. We even saw a few turtles in the surf. This condo is a little slice of paradise! I highly recommend it!!

Die Beschreibung des Hauses  ist absolut realistisch und die Umgebung, das Plateau Mont Royal ist die neue trendische Wohn und Lebensgegend in Montreal. Wir haben mit als Familie mit 4 erwachsenen Kindern dort eine sehr schöne Woche verbracht, viel zu Fuss unternommen, Croissants beim besten Bäcker der Stadt um die Ecke gekauft und die erwachsenen Kinder in einer der angesagtesten Bars um die Ecke mit Montrealer freunden gefeiert.

We explored the island during the day, hanged at the beach… It felt like the time had stopped for a while.

We had booked and paid correctly, it appears there may have been a problem with the Air BNB site. However, from this point on staying there became very uncomfortable.\nOver the next couple of days there were more problems. She could not tell us the wifi password, so we were unable to use the wifi. She told us we could not use the air conditioning. Finally, she refused us access to the kitchen to heat up our dinner, and told us we could not eat in the house, so we ended up eating cold pies in the garden at night. \nIt was so uncomfortable we decided to leave early, and did not stay the last night. \n"},{"_id":"161404666","date":{"$date":"2017-06-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1321603","reviewer_id":"133694059","reviewer_name":"Amanda","comments":"\nReview:\nAnn was a thoughtful, generous  host with a sense of humour.

Some people mentioned that the furniture it out of date, it just felt like classic Hawaiian style to me. I won't lie the room had a weird smell but I think it might be from the dampness on Kauai combined with the cleaner used and maybe running the AC. Not sure but it wasn't anything horrible!!

The wifi, for instance, was fast and reliable enough for me to get work done in between outings. Laundry: check. Bar/restaurant (you don't have to leave the grounds for): check. I am always vaguely concerned when a host is hands-off, but in reality, the KBR staff can and will help you with whatever your dysfunction is and do so with a smile.

The view of the Hudson River and the GWB, especially a night are awesome. It was a pleasure staying here. I would say the only downside is parking, but I expect that could be said of anywhere in New York, although there are two parking garages within 200 yards of the front door. This was my first AirBnB experience and Lee set a high bar for anybody else to follow :-)"}]}

Throughout the booking and arriving phase Sebastian communicated clearly and effectively. He was very helpful when we needed suggestions for parking. The unit was in spotless condition and was better than the photos. He even has a handy tour guide booklet printed off for guests. The location was prime for exploring downtown Montreal. It was just a 3-4 minute was from the Metro. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately our visit was tainted by a burglary. The backdoor appears to have been unlocked. We didn't use the door and were unaware of its existence until departing the residence. Sebastien is sure that it was left locked. We had left around 3 pm and returned around 3 Am after attending Kanye West at the Bell center and going out on the town. During the break and enter my personal laptop was stolen and a closet door was destroyed. The police came and there was little they could do without the tracking software installed on my laptop. I do believe Sebastien is a great host and has a great spot, but I was very unimpressed with his handling of the event. He had little to no concern about the loss of my possessions and even tried to charge us 400$ for the damages to his closet. Airbnb costumer service throughout this process was useless and made settling back into things at home quite stressful. This experience has caused me to consider traditional methods of lodging for future trips. Although, I think this was an unfortunate coincidence it certainly put a damper on our trip.

The host, Kazue san was very precise, friendly and kind. She double checked our check-in time to be on time and asked us if we have any questions even before we arrive at Hawaii. The room was spacious and extremely clean. Also interior was fancy.(totally different with the exterior of the building) Beds was comfortable enough to solve our tiredness from tight trip schedules and everything in this apartment was well-prepared. The best two advantages of this apartment are cleaness and Well-stocked daily supplies. Thanks to the host for making us feel and live like one of the local Hawaiians. I would defenetly stay in her place again if I have another chance to go to Hawaii!!"},{"_id":"97550262","date":{"$date":"2016-08-27T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13266188","reviewer_id":"69418845","reviewer_name":"Ferdinand","comments":"Kazue was very accommodating as soon as we got to the location.\nAs soon as we walked in, she gave us a detailed tour of the house and the location.\n\nShe as well had extra amenities for us to last the whole week, if not extra being provided.\n\nKazue was a great host and anyone wanting a close home by the beach should definitely go ahead with kazue's airbnb. :)"},{"_id":"100372076","date":{"$date":"2016-09-09T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13266188","reviewer_id":"17850325","reviewer_name":"Nebojsa","comments":"great location, nice place, great host.....

Very modest, but that was just fine - we didn't visit Waikiki to stay inside all day! It is two air-conditioned bedrooms with two single beds in each, and one bathroom at the end of the hallway/kitchenette combination connecting everything. We tried pushing two beds together to make a double, but they were slightly different heights so it didn't work. There is a nice fridge/freezer, and a stovetop if you wanted to do simple cooking in the kitchenette/hallway, although with so many amazing food options within walking distance, we didn't bother. \n\nThe location is great - walking distance to everything in Waikiki. And the convenience of also being able to rent a parking space helped out tremendously. We rented an affordable car from Turo (use link (Website hidden by Airbnb) for $25 free credit) to explore the island, as Lyft/Uber were surprisingly expensive. I would highly recommend taking advantage of the great parking space and getting a car - Waikiki is one of the many amazing places on Oahu, so give yourself the chance to explore.\n\nI would highly recommend this place if your primary goal is a comfortable place to sleep. If you're looking for a luxury resort room, go to the Sheraton. If you're looking for a modest place to sleep each night, this cozy two bedroom with four single beds in the heart of Waikiki is absolutely the perfect place.

It's a top-floor corner apt, so it was generally nice and quiet. The AC is a bit loud, but it's fine if you turn it on Low. It's a great place to come home to after a day out exploring the island, but it's a bit small to spend an afternoon there relaxing. There is no living room, and the kitchen/eating space is small. But none of that really mattered to us. We were able to cook a nice egg breakfast every morning, and head out into the the busy Waikiki neighborhood (really crowded!), explore the island, eat dinner out (make reservations! Or try your luck at the Duke's restaurants, some of which don't take reservations), and come back to a quiet apartment. Plenty of hot water, and great water pressure. We loved that there were four separate beds, all comfortable. Our host Joyce was very responsive and attentive."},{"_id":"403443483","date":{"$date":"2019-01-20T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13266188","reviewer_id":"235125147","reviewer_name":"Rich","comments":"Incredible value five minute walk to the beach, 4 beds, kitchen and safe."},{"_id":"403881206","date":{"$date":"2019-01-21T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13266188","reviewer_id":"50174769","reviewer_name":"Jack","comments":"Kazue’s place was located in an easily accessible place to Waikiki’s main attractions.

Something which Chronis did not mention beforehand. When we brought to his attention, he says that \"this is a usual Istanbul problem. It's not my house problem\". A great way to wash his hands off the situation in my opinion. \n2) Cancellation and refunds will not be entertained. Initially, we wanted to change the dates but his appartment was not available on those dates. We had asked if we could get a refund since it's not available but he did not respond. So we went with the initial dates. Second time we asked for a refund was after the water shortage incident. We didn't stay throughout, and had 6 nights remaining. Once again we asked for a refund but he did not respond. \n\nIf you're ok to infrequent water supply and a host that does not respond to refund then the appartment will suit you just fine."},{"_id":"191305128","date":{"$date":"2017-09-07T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13272687","reviewer_id":"45723884","reviewer_name":"LeoJ","comments":"Very spacious and quiet. Excellent view from the large window in living room. Good kitchen amenities. Very clean except for a bit dusty floors for barefoot walking. Wifi worked very well. About 200m walking to a bus stop where many buses pass by. Another 100m lead to a popular commercial street where there are a lot of shops and restaurants. Downstairs is a store for basic groceries but sophisticated groceries were nowhere around. Host's unwillingness to supply toilet paper in addition to a small leftover caused some inconvenience as it was not easy to buy a single roll. We have not met Chronis but communicated often with the caretaking lady who was nice and responsive. Overall the 4 of us had a very good stay of 8 days.

Is good communication to your host and a warm welcome important to you? Ever wanted to stay in an amazingly designed, old Istanbul-apartment? Then you found your location to stay! My friend and I, both of turkish decent, stayed in this apartment for a week during March (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) Two days before our flight to Istanbuk, Chronis contacted us and gave us thorough information on address and what we should be careful about, like not being too loud with music for the sake of the neighbors. Furthermore he told us, that his assistant Ms. Margarita will welcome us at our arrival, since he was not in Istanbul during that time. He gave us Ms. Margaritas and his phonenumer to contact them upon arrival via phone or (Hidden by Airbnb) Messenger. After our arrival we contacted Ms. Margarita on (Hidden by Airbnb) and told her our approximate time of arrival in front of the apartment. She responded quickly. Upon arrival at the apartment we rang the bell of the flat, which Chronis told us in before and were quickly welcomed by Ms. Margarita. She gave us a very friendly and warm welcome and informed us on everything important about the flat. She had only prepared one bed in the big bedroom, since she assumed we'd be a couple. After having told her, that we need two seperate beds, the quickly prepared the second bed in the small bedroom, without any hesitation. Furthermore she informed us about possible issues like water failures, which is normal in Istanbul during this season, because of heavy rains and a bad water infrastructure. She even prepared water canisters in case, so that we could still finish the shower or use the toilet. Because it was already very late when we arrived, we agreed on asking further questions via phone or (Hidden by Airbnb) . The following days, she wrote us on (Hidden by Airbnb) to check if everything's ok. During our stay we made mostly good experiences with the flat. The most mentionable ones are the following: 1) The bed in the big bedroom is very comfy. 2) There are lots of fresh towels and duvet covers in case that you like to change very frequently. 3) The kitchen is equipped with everything needed for a decent meal. The stove is new and there is a dishwasher, if you like to use one. 4) The view from the living room is AMAZING! I doubt, you can find many other apartments with such a nice view in central Istanbul. 5) The water actually never failed ;) There were also some SMALLER points, which could improve. The most important ones: 1) The bed in the smaller bedroom is directy next to the radiator, which can make sleeping there during the cold season very hot. If you shut off the heating, the floor and flat itself can get quite cold, since it's an old building with wood battens. 2)..."},{"_id":"253045011","date":{"$date":"2018-04-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13272687","reviewer_id":"23592840","reviewer_name":"Laura","comments":"Very nice apartment. \nNice location and enjoyable walk to the action, spacious, decorated very nicely.

When we finally arrived to the flat and it was prepared, the cleanliness left much to be desired. We understand that failures can be anywhere, but Vania, the girl in charge of managing the property did not inform us of anything and when she finally picked up the phone his response was curt and inconsiderate. This unpleasant reception made our arrival in Oporto quite bitter. This level of zero communication is maintained throughout our stay, when we asked if we could leave more than one hour our bags the day of departure (because the apartment had been ready 5 hours later the official checkin it was the minimum) Vania an hour later, curtly he replied that it was not possible ...

I'm not usually one to write a review. However, I feel that strongly about my stay at this apartment that I feel I must so other travellers do not experience the problems I had. There is exstensive work happening on the corner of George Street \u0026 Bridge Street due to the construction of the light rail system(it was very disappointing that this was not mentioned anywhere in the description or throughout the booking process). On the second night 3 of the 4 guests were unable to sleep due to the excessive noise. When I rang the property manager(Arnold) to inform him of the noise and that we were unhappy about it he said that there haven't been any complaints from previous guests and that there was nothing he could do. I explained that I wasn't concerned about other guests, just my party. After much discussion his resolution was a refund for our unused nights in the apartment..............but we would have to find alternative accommodation ourselves! Not only were we wasting our vacation time trying to rectify the situation, but we then had to use more of our time trying to find alternative accommodation. With our vacation time in Sydney being only 5 nights, you can imagine how frustrating this was. Due to the short period we decided to stay on at the apartment. However, the following night there was noise outside the apartment on Bridge Street due to what looked like industrial electricians laying cables underground. Once again waking the party. The apartment itself was very disappointing, dark \u0026 outdated. You can not open the living room blinds as there is an office block a few metres directly adjacent. The bathroom is small \u0026 the overall cleanliness of the apartment was very poor. There were clumps of dust in the bathroom \u0026 when my partner moved the bed to plug in her phone charger, the dust \u0026 dirt was discusting! I found this very strange as a $243 \"cleaning fee\" is charged at the time of booking? This was relayed back to Arnold who said that he would get the cleaners back that day. Although the cleaners had returned back there, it was quite evident that they had just done the bare minimum \u0026 the large clumps of dust were still in the corner of the bathroom. By this stage of the vacation we had gone past caring and just wanted to enjoy our time in Sydney. Arnold did refund the $243 \"cleaning fee\", but only after a heated discussion. He also had to send in an electrician to fix a power point that was hanging off the wall and on a seperate occasion an electrician to change the light bulbs. Being a property management company you would think the apartment would be checked and this would of been done prior to guests entering the property?

Check-in on the weekends is a little difficult as the property manager is not available and you have arrange to have someone pick up the keys ahead of time or pick them up from a lockbox in a completely different location.  During our stay, there was serious construction noise at night that started on the second night of our stay.  This was unexpected and anticipated to last two weeks.  Keris was kind enough to allow us to relocate to a hotel and refunded us for the unused nights which we greatly appreciated.  We were sad to have to end our stay early.  We would stay here again in the future if we have the opportunity.

Almost in front of the villa, you find a big and classy supermarket. The best restaurants are located at Barao de Ipanema Street, just in front of the outside gate. One block ahead, at Bolivar Street, lies the best nightlife of Copacabana, with many bars, pubs and restaurants that keep open after hours. All main tourist attractions (the Christ, Sugar Loaf, Botanical Garden) are easily accessible by subway, bus or taxi.","notes":"","transit":"Transportation is easy and abundant. The Cantagalo subway station is just one block away, allowing safe and cheap connection to downtown and western areas. At Pompeu Loureiro Street you find several public buses to touristic areas of your interest. Taxis are plenty, you do not spend more than 10 seconds waiting for one (well, not when it rains). From or to the Galeao international airport, a taxi will take about 40 minutes and will cost you no more than the equivalent to US$ 20. From the Santos Dumont domestic airport, it is only 20 minutes far and a taxi ride will cost you the equivalent to US$ 10.","access":"In the kitchen, that you can use at your will and anytime, you find cups and glasses, plates of different sizes, spoons + knives + forks, a filter with potable water, a microwave oven to heat your food and a coffee machine, with coffee and sugar available for free. NO STOVE IS AVAILABLE. As other common areas, you find a TV room with Brazilian cable channels and a dining room with fancy table and chairs, located into a high lobby area, with a big chandelier falling over it. You have internet  Wi-Fi everywhere. You will meet only selected guests like you, who booked through online platforms and had their identities previously checked.","interaction":"you may count on me as your host in Rio, doing all my best to help you to make this an unforgettable trip. I think that hosting is much more than simply giving you the keys for your bedroom. Soon after your booking, I’ll send you a guide with information on how to get to the guesthouse and tips on what to do in town and in the neighborhood. As you arrive, I’ll personally give you insider information on the city and the best programs for the days you spend here. Along your stay, I’ll invite you to join my family at my own home, located from a five-minute walk, for a pool party or a caipirinha lesson. You will get a friend here for everything, this is my commitment with you and also a pleasure for myself. Hope to see you soon in Rio!","house_rules":"No big rules. You will be in a residential villa, so silence is the standard for your and your neighbor's comfort. You can use the kitchen anytime, but you should clean it after using it. Smoking is allowed only outside the guesthouse, never inside your suite. You are expected to help to save the planet and my pocket, by using power and water with no wastes, I'd appreciate if you would help to turn lights off when you are not in that ambient.","property_type":"Townhouse","room_type":"Private room","bed_type":"Real Bed","minimum_nights":"3","maximum_nights":"1125","cancellation_policy":"flexible","last_scraped":{"$date":"2019-02-11T05:00:00.000Z"},"calendar_last_scraped":{"$date":"2019-02-11T05:00:00.000Z"},"first_review":{"$date":"2016-07-23T04:00:00.000Z"},"last_review":{"$date":"2018-12-28T05:00:00.000Z"},"accommodates":2,"bedrooms":1,"beds":1,"number_of_reviews":64,"bathrooms":{"$numberDecimal":"1.0"},"amenities":["TV","Internet","Wifi","Air conditioning","Kitchen","Paid parking off premises","Free street parking","Family/kid friendly","Washer","Dryer","Essentials","Shampoo","Hangers","Hair dryer","Iron","Laptop friendly workspace","Self check-in","Building staff","Private entrance","Hot water","Luggage dropoff allowed","Long term stays allowed","Host greets you","Other"],"price":{"$numberDecimal":"101.00"},"security_deposit":{"$numberDecimal":"0.00"},"cleaning_fee":{"$numberDecimal":"0.00"},"extra_people":{"$numberDecimal":"900.00"},"guests_included":{"$numberDecimal":"2"},"images":{"thumbnail_url":"","medium_url":"","picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/76b7f670-b3ba-48ec-bd7c-7052467478e3.jpg?aki_policy=large","xl_picture_url":""},"host":{"host_id":"3535482","host_url":"https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/3535482","host_name":"Sergio","host_location":"Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","host_about":"I'm a 52-year old Brazilian guy, who is truly having a great time being a host in Rio! A little about me: I was born in small town who came to Rio to study Engineering and have been living here for the past 35 years. I love this city and know it quite well, please give me a chance to show it to you. For 25 years I have worked in Finance and Mine Engineering, now I'm at a phase of better life quality, working as a consultant from my home office. I live in a big penthouse, which I'm gradually improving. I've tried Airbnb before as a guest and since mid-2014 I've been a host. I try to become a friend to my guests, helping them to take the best of my wonderful city with safety and comfort. I speak fluent English, Spanish, Portuguese (of course), but I also understand German and other Latin-based languages. I have a young mind, love outdoors activity, bike, running at the beach, but also reading, music (from rock to opera) and travel. I'm quite easygoing, sociable and talkative. Hope to see you soon in Rio!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIch bin 52 Jahre alt, Brasilianer, von einem kleiner Stadt wer kommte nach Rio um Inginieurswissenschaft studieren und hier geblieben. Für 25 Jahre, arbeitete ich mit Finanz und auch im Bergbau,  jetzt bin ich ein Früh-Rentner, mit meinen einigen Büro zur Hause. Ich wohne in Copacabana in einem grosser Wohnung und habe neulich etwa Rennovierung gemacht. Ich hoffe dass Sie mir eine Chance geben eine Chance um Sie meine schöne Stadt zu zeigen! Ich bin sehr lebhafter, radfahre im Strand jeden Morgen, spreche flüssig Englisch + Spanisch (und natürlich Portugiesisch), verstehe auch andere Sprache. Es gefällt mir zuviel yu reisen, ich bin schon in vielen Länder gewesen, so ich galube ich verstehe was Sie brauchen für die beste Reise nach Rio erleben.

Every room is a little bit different, but all have modern bathrooms and are exactly as in the pictures. The rooms on the lower floor have AC, whereas the rooms on the upper floor have  fans. Both floors have a small kitchen area. There is a washing machine and you can borrow one of the many tour guides. The street where the house is located is very quiet as it is a gated community and closed from traffic. This is a rare find at such a central location at the heart of Copacabana, only 10 minutes walk from the beach, many restaurants and bars. You can also find supermarkets, the pharmacy and the closest metro station just around the corner. Despite the great amenities, the best of all in this place is not the building, but the host. Sergio is an overly friendly host who is eager to guide you through the city and invite you to a caipirinha at his place.

On the other hand, the apartment was mouldy and dirty. The bathroom was incredibly dirty and we had to take extra measures to take a shower. Further, there was no ventilation in the bathroom which added to the smell and unappealing look of the bathroom. The shower curtain also had mould-like substance on it. The rest of apartment had mould growing in all corners of the apartment. The apartment was also dusty. Lastly, there were no bathroon necessities provided.

One bedroom, nice size living room/dining room, small kitchen with a good layout. The apt has an overall nice layout and style. This is someone’s home and his personal belongings are there, he manages to tuck most things away and we felt we had plenty of personal space. He had awesome pots full of lettuce!

Nous avons pu également utiliser le lave linge et sèche linge ce qui est vraiment super pendant ses vacances. Derek avait pris soin de mettre à notre disposition des serviettes de plage, de bain et même des produits beauté !\nL'emplacement de la maison est parfait. Au calme. Vous ne verrez pas la mer de votre chambre mais il y a moins de 2minutes entre la plage et votre lit ! Ce qui reste le principal !\nIl y a une super boulangerie à moins de 5 minutes à pieds (Teds Bakery) et un paquets de super foodtrucks à 10min en voiture.

We had an awesome stay and Derek was very laid back with good energy.  The room has a private entrance off the big back deck and was clean and had everything we needed.  We used his bikes and there's a fantastic bike trail that's accessed from the neighborhood that will take you to the store, the beach, local restaurants etc.  We walked to Ted's for breakfast just around the corner and beach is literally about 100 steps from the house.  The neighborhood has a very local vibe, is off the main roads but literally in the middle of tons of stuff in all directions.  Derek gave us tips on good places to check out and shared his place - kitchen, living room etc. like an old friend.

You have your own screen door onto a back porch with a hammock for two and other beach furnishings.\nDerek recently added more space to his house.  There is a shared bath. But Derek opens his entire house for your use.\n This was our first experience with Airbnb. And we were caught a little off guard by the fact that Airbnb's do not usually include breakfast. That really didn't spoil anything though.\nThere was a great breakfast bakery within walking distance of Derek's -- I had my first experience there with a Moco loco or is it loco moco.\n Derek was very informative about places to eat and things to do in the general area. He and his roommate which he were great hosts. So on the last evening we were there, we decided to make dinner for the four of us -- me my wife and Derek and his roommate Richie. To be honest it was the highlight of the stay. We had a few beers (if I say so myself great food).  We shared war stories laughed a lot and generally had a great time.

It was just steps from Sunset Beach and a few blocks from Ted's Bakery and the bus stop. I didn't have a car so that was pretty important. Though I only used a provided bike once, I regretted not using it more. It made it so much easier to get to food. (I mostly walked the 2.5 miles to all the food trucks, or over to Ted's.) This was a working vacation, so wi-fi and a nice outdoor spot to work was high on my list of must-haves for the trip. The back lanai was perfect! I was able to work from the hammock and take a brief lunch-time nap there as well. And with a door from the bedroom to the lanai,  it was nice to be able to get out there without having to walk through the rest of the house. The room was perfectly comfortable, clean, and included an iron \u0026 hair dryer. Derek \u0026 Rich were both very friendly and it was good chatting \u0026 dining with them. Though it was easily walkable, Derek even drove the 2 blocks to pick me up at the bus stop when it was raining heavily upon my arrival. I'd definitely stay again! I may even go back again for Halloween, their neighborhood really knows how to celebrate. Everyone was dressed up and a lot of the homes were decorated for the holiday."},{"_id":"210159105","date":{"$date":"2017-11-07T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13318405","reviewer_id":"123701383","reviewer_name":"Drei","comments":"This house is really near the Sunset Beach, just few steps away.

Great guys! Prime location in north shore Oahu and they have equipment like snorkling stuff and paddle boards you can borrow. \n\nFew things I was a little disappointed with is the two rooms.”, bathroom and fridge  that are for Airbnb guests are a little unkept and not as appealing to the eye and for the price point, I expected a little more. Luckily for us we didn’t have to share the bathroom but normally they say the bathroom is shared which was another thing I wasn’t expecting.

From the time I booked, they were in regular communication and offered to help every step of the way, including arranging a private car service to/from airport.  If I had any questions about the room, they would return message right away. \r\n\r\nThe apt is located in a very well situation place, only about 10 min walk to Copacabana and 5 min walk to Ipanema. The busy Genenral Osorio metro stop's exit D is literally at the doorstep of the apt.  There's just so many things to do in this neighborhood. Everything is walking distance, there are restaurants, bars, supermarkets, and shops galore.  It is also a safe neighborhood and you always see locals walking around.  Note, do your part and be alert - don't walk around displaying expensive gear or wander into unknown neighborhoods.\r\n\r\nThe Inside is compact and makes very efficient use of space, suitable for 1 or 2 people to stay comfortably.  The unit has recently been completed gutted and renovated. As such, the it is spic and span clean and everything was brand spanking new. EVERYTHING. The amenities are wonderful - the room has modern fixtures and furniture, rain shower (so nice!!) with mood lighting, a small but functional kitchenette with a small fridge, water filteration machine for drinking water, Nespresso machine, microwave, oven, pots + pan, glass, bowls, plates, cuttery and silverware. Leave everything at home b/c you will not need it! There's even a combo washer/dryer machine.  There is a flatscreen TV with cable and there's even a bluetooth enabled Harmon Kardon speaker system. It is LOUD and BASSY (keep your neighbors in mind lol). The bed is a pullout bed that will comfortably sleep two adults. It's not a cheap, creaky mattress but very supportive and a bit on the firm side (which I like).  There's also a small vacuum cleaner if you're like me and like to keep the floor debri-free.\r\n\r\nI would not hesitate to stay here again.  It is not beachside like one may first look for but the convenience of being right next to a subway stop, a busy neighborhood that's right in the middle of two very famous beaches is insanely nice. It's not just the beach however; the beautiful lake, Lagoa Rodrigo de Freitas (aka \"Lagoa\") is also nearby and I went for running there around the track. \r\n\r\nLastly, special thanks to Raygs and Camila for making me feel so welcomed during the Olympic games and being so helpful at all times.  They are extremely friendly, attentive, responsive, and responsible.\r\n\r\nObrigado and until next time!"},{"_id":"96246877","date":{"$date":"2016-08-22T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13324467","reviewer_id":"32600621","reviewer_name":"Andre","comments":"Nossa estadia no loft foi excelente ! \r\n\r\nPrimeiramente o loft é decorado e cuidado com extrema atenção aos detalhes.

This was my first experience in Copacabana/Ipanema/Rio! \n\nRaygs and Camila went above and beyond welcoming me and making this experience flawless! They started out by giving me information on local sites, a recommended itinerary, and video instructions on the loft and its amenities. \n\nWhile I embarked on my 4 days in Rio I utilized many of the recommendations including the places to eat, the driver for pick up @ the airport and getting to activities, and the referral for paragliding (a must do)! Their help on this last minute paragliding was unforgettable and made the experience truly epic!\n\nI appreciated being introduced to the neighbor who was so helpful and gave all the information I needed to use the washer, fan, dryer, Bluetooth connections etc! I loved the sound system! \n\nI was thankful for the USB ports and the US plugins! Was able to charge all my devices without any problems! \n\nThe water filter was nice and the Nespresso machine was easy to use! They even had welcome snacks!  I ate them all! \n\nI couldn’t have asked for a better place to stay during my 4 days in Brazil! The communication was excellent and I had no problems coming or going and navigating the area! \n\nUber and Taxis are easy to use (we used Uber almost all the time) and they come right away! This is a safe neighborhood and I loved the cultural experience right when you enter the streets! My friends who were also staying in the area loved my place and said they would definitely stay there next time they come to visit Rio! \n\nIf you are looking for a centralized location in this area - book this place!

Probably best for 2 or at most 3 people as the second room is a rather narrow fold-out sofa in the living area. The terrace is wonderful, gets direct sun only in mid to late afternoon. AC works great. Also note this is a holiday apt not his home so there is not much in the kitchen apart from salt, pepper, oil and vinegar. Several food stores on the same street where you can stock up and are open late.

Everything was perfect and just like we wanted. Let's start from the location. It's on Poble Sec's small street, maybe 250 m from Paral-El Metro station. There's a lot of small supermarkets, tapas, bars, restaurant. The neighborhood  is quiet and safe. You can get quickly to any part of the city, many of attractions you can reach on walk (f.e Rambla 10-15 min).\r\n\r\nThe flat is suitable for max 4 people. Everything you need is just there so you can wash, prepare food, eat on terrace and even clean If you wish. You'll find there a lot of space to hide your bags and clothes. According to the price which about ** hotel rate you'll get much more spacious apartment. I don't know what to add about the place - it's bull's eye. \r\n\r\nAntoni is like an angel - he listens to you carefully, smiles a lot and then he does exactly everything not to disappoint you. You can call him any time when in trouble or when any help is needed. You won't regret - do doubts. \r\n\r\nMy girl and our son were also under impression of that not expensive way to stay in Barcelona. Of course - there is no need to sit there all day long. There is a million things to do out in the city. \r\n\r\nWe highly recommend that place and its absolutely nice owner and we'll stay there again for sure.\r\n\r\nAny cons, you wonder? I can't see any. But if you need any I will list some which wasn't too much problem for us, but they exist:\r\n\r\n1. The corridor and the elevator are quite small. So we had to do some extra moves:) to get in and out. \r\n2. From time to time you can smell something not pleasant from the sewerage on the terrace but we've noticed that it happens almost everywhere in Barcelona.\r\n3. Yeah, the scratches on the bathtub could be fixed but if you are not princess nor prince you can do your shower without worries :)\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever - we miss the place, we miss Antoni and, of course, we miss Barcelona."},{"_id":"12046723","date":{"$date":"2014-04-22T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1332929","reviewer_id":"11339363","reviewer_name":"Carmen","comments":"Antoni is a perfect host, Always with a smile and giving good advices for any need.

The nice thing is that it is in a neighborhood that is not too tourist-oriented. One block from the apt is Carrer de Blai - a pedestrian only street that for blocks has many restaurants and bars. The food is delicious and costs much less than what you pay in places that most tourists go. Across the street is a small market, and just 3 blocks or so away is the Metro.

The location is very convenient.\r\nWe had a bit of a hard time deciding on a meeting time for the keys but it was in part due to my phone problems.

We had our car with us and he had arranged parking in a secure underground car park, and it felt very secure, although it was 10 minutes walk so if guests have a lot of luggage I would advise dropping bags off first. Also, if driving, note that the roads in the area are one way!\r\n\r\nThe apartment was as described, comfortable and practical, equipped with everything we needed, good wifi and plenty of hot water. The roof terrace made it for us and we ate every meal outside, which in turn meant we could leave the sofa bed out in the sitting/dining room, making like much easier.\r\n\r\nThe location was great - an easy walk to Montjuic for cable car and magic fountain. Only 5 mins to Parallel metro, which seemed to be the best line for the touristy things we wanted to do, and 20 mins max walk to La Rambla. Antoni recommended the next road (Carrer de Blai) for good tapas - it was cheap but it felt a bit touristy and not great quality, and there were hardly any children about in the evening so the atmosphere was a bit grown up for our family.\r\n\r\nAntoni was so welcoming, we really appreciated his friendliness and would visit his apartment again."},{"_id":"79355227","date":{"$date":"2016-06-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1332929","reviewer_id":"55682832","reviewer_name":"Vencislav","comments":"Perfect location, lovely terrace, excellent host. thank you , Antoni!"},{"_id":"81710114","date":{"$date":"2016-06-24T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1332929","reviewer_id":"25449196","reviewer_name":"Sue","comments":"Antoni's apartment was in a great location with a nice outdoor area for breakfast etc.  apartment had everything we needed for a short break."},{"_id":"82232414","date":{"$date":"2016-06-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1332929","reviewer_id":"43408455","reviewer_name":"Guiraude","comments":"Appartement très bien placé permettant de visiter l'ensemble de la ville à pied.

He met us at the appartment and was very friendly and welcoming. He gave us all the necessary information for the appartment, suggested good places to eat in the neighbourhood and offered to organise our taxi back to the airport which was a huge help. \nThe appartment was quite small as described but we were out enjoying the beautiful city of Barcelona all day every day so it was a perfect place for us to come and chill out. The beds were comfortable and the kitchen had everything we needed for cooking meals for the kids. The bathroom had both bath and shower which was perfect for us because our kids love a bath! The terrace was amazing. A very good size and we ate breakfast out there in the sunshine every day and enjoyed a glass of wine in the evening. \nWe would definitely recommend Antoni's appartment to anybody else who was looking for a lovely, comfortable place to stay that was in easy walking distance to many of the beautiful sights Barcelona has to offer and very close to a metro station. Poble Sec was an awesome area which was lively and friendly but also quiet enough that we weren't disturbed by noise at nights. We would choose it again on our return visit (which we absolutely will be booking without too much delay!) \nAntoni, you were wonderful!

Attentive and communicative before we even arrived. He was right on time to let us in which was amazing as we'd done the red eye with our child and we were tired. The neighborhood was close to everything we wanted to see and do. Very easy to take the subway, walk or grab a cab on Parallel. Around the corner I would buy a fresh and warm baguette and some fruit at the corner fruit and veggie stand every morning. The kitchen had everything we needed and we had breakfast at home every morning easily. One of the best things we did was take a 2 hour Segway tour! Really fun- and got to see a lot and learn a lot - my 11 year old loved it! Favorite pizza was 5 blocks away - super friendly and oven baked pizza - delicious - and fast! You can get it to go also - but the place is a real local hang out - enjoy! Pizza del Sortidor on Carrer Blasco de Gary's, #46. Yum! Best meal I had was at Cafe de L'Academia but make a reservation! Delicious!! The apartment is just like the pictures - small - we were a party of three and it was perfect for us. I loved the Gothic but every review talked about late hours and street noise. This apartment was nice and quiet. There was someone who filled the hall with cigarette smoke on two afternoons - but once in our apartment we were fine. Elevator was nice! Highly recommend this apartment and Barcelona!

La déco de l'appartement est à refaire avec soin. Le logement ne comporte pas 2 chambres mais 1 seule avec un canapé lit dans l'espace commun (12m carré environ). Les lattes du sommier du lit de la chambre sont cassés depuis sûrement pas mal de temps. L’hôte a mis une planche de bois à la place pour remplacer le sommier. A noter aussi que le matelas du canapé lit et les têtes d'oreillers sont tachés (protège matelas et tête d'oreiller non présents). La télé avec câble était inexistante (d'ailleurs il n'y avait pas de son). \nLes indications misent sur l'annonce sur le temps de trajet sont erronées (mer a 15min alors qu'il faut bien 40/45 min pour y aller).\nA noter aussi que la cuisine n'a pas de lave vaisselle et qu'il y a très peu d'ustensile pour y faire à manger (donc prévoyez des torchons !). Il n'y a pas de cafetière comme indiqué sur l'annonce.\nLes volets sont vétustes et fonctionnent très mal. Nous avons eu le désagrément, au bout de 3 jours, de voir un des volets se casser. \nNous sommes allés à Barcelone en voiture, une fois arrivée sur place nous avons eu la mauvaise surprise d'avoir un parking réservé par l'hôte mais payant (environ 80 euros la semaine) alors que sur l'annonce il est bien indiqué que le parking est gratuit. \n\nMalgré tout, nous avons passé un bon séjour à Barcelone. L'appartement est néanmoins au calme et la terrasse pour déjeuner le matin est agréable mais trop chaude en été (à partir de 12H). En bas de l'appartement, il y a beaucoup de petits commerçants pour y faire quelques courses et la bouche de métro est très proche (environ 5 min). Il y a une longue rue à tapas (carrer de blai) très sympathique ou nous pouvons y manger de bonnes spécialités. \n\nPar correction, nous avons indiqué lors de notre départ, à Toni, toutes ces informations pour le tenir au courant."},{"_id":"310252508","date":{"$date":"2018-08-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1332929","reviewer_id":"52513735","reviewer_name":"Hilde","comments":"Great person and great value for your money!!"},{"_id":"313910843","date":{"$date":"2018-08-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1332929","reviewer_id":"166342282","reviewer_name":"James","comments":"Antoni was a great host who was happy to help.

The apartment was all set up for us with the baby cot made up in one of the bedrooms and was very clean. Andrea was really helpful too! \n\n\n\nIt's perfectly equipped with everything we needed to cook, do laundry etc. \n\nThe only thing to be aware of is that it's located on the fourth floor so if you've got lots of bags or baby gear (like us) it's a bit of a workout, but nothing too major. \n\nThe guide in the apartment was really helpful with recommendations for finding places to eat, buy groceries etc. There are loads of independent cafes and quirky bars in the surrounding squares and lane ways, as well as being a short walk from the city's historic sites so couldn't have asked for a better base for a few days.\n\nThanks guys!

There are dozens of bars, restaurants and bakeries within a few minutes walk, a large supermarket five minutes walk up the road, and most of the city's places of interest within an easy twenty minute stroll.\n\nYou may have to put up with some noise at night. Porto is a lively city and there were a lot of student activities taking place the weekend we were there.  If you're planning to be out late this won't be a problem, but if you have kids and want an early night, and especially if you sleep with the windows open, you might not get the good night's sleep you were hoping for.

The kitchen was nice and well stocked with cooking items. There was wifi included. It's up a few flights of stairs, on the 3rd (top floor) I believe. For the colder months there were a few electric heaters which warmed up the unit nicely. The rooms are decent size and the bed was firm but quite comfortable.\nThe bathroom is quite small with just a small stand up shower. Since the bathroom was so small it would have been very helpful if there were some shelving or some vanity space since there was really nowhere to put any toiletries. I would highly recommend installing some inexpensive shelving as there was ample room to install these and that would solve the issue of lack of toiletry space. We brought in a chair to set our toiletries on but then it crammed the space even more. \nOverall it was great value for a great location and I would not hesitate to consider this property when in Porto."},{"_id":"216576718","date":{"$date":"2017-12-04T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13333008","reviewer_id":"15265136","reviewer_name":"Muriel","comments":"Buon appartamento.

From the outside, the building could use some TLC but Ziggy’s Place is well cared for, bright and airy. The bed is comfortable, bathroom spacious and the place is clean. Lots of towels and toiletries provided, including beach towels. Enjoyed the balcony although the views aren’t that great, there isn’t much foot traffic below, except when the cafe is open but that isn’t a bother. It’s great for bird watching and we were lucky to have cockatoos and lorikeets and noisy miners come to our balcony. Enjoyed the whirlpool and did use the BBQ. Did not use the laundry $6 to wash and dry a load. Neighbors are quiet.

Great grill for cooking meats and veggies on the patio.  The beach just a short walk away.  Snorkeling in Cabbage Tree Marine reserve is full of life with giant cuttlefish, rays, and countless fish. I've never been to a place where at sunrise SO many people were up and active with either surfing, running, swimming, kayaking, yoga, etc.... Manly is a must and this location makes you feel like you are part of something special.\n(Ziggy, by accident we had a towel out of the room after leaving the keys inside at checkout and hung it on the door.

The apartment is beautiful. Sure, it’s in a third floor and it’s a fair bit of stairs but you only really feel that when carrying heavy suitcases! \nBut it makes up for it in everything else - check in was super smooth, the flat was spotless, it is decorated with immense taste and is furnished with top notch appliances. The washing machine/dryer are a luxury in Manhattan!\nBoth beds have beautiful foam mattresses and very soft sheets. \nAlso, it’s just round the corner from Whole Foods and a number of lovely places to eat. \n\n\nIt is a wonderful space and we truly enjoyed staying here very much."}]}

We had a wonderful fire in the potbellied stove at night to take the chill off.  We played games, fixed our meals and generally had a totally comfortable and relaxing time.  It felt as comfortable as \"home\" with books and magazines to read and games to play.  During the days we went out \"gallivanting\".  We were a 20 minute drive to Ho'okena (a white sand beach where the dolphins come to swim).  There were coffee farms near by and we were able to easily access South Point (where the first Hawaiians landed on the island!)

It is more like glamping and not a vacation B\u0026B.  The refrigerator is run on propane and is very old and unreliable, where a bungee cord is used to keep the freezer door closed and sealed.  There were spiders and spider webs throughout the house.  When my daughters sat on the couch and moved a pillow, there were spiders moving everywhere and she killed three of them.  It is very dusty, and one of the mattresses was soiled and should not have been offered for sleeping.  Multiple dog excriment (poop) was in front of the entry door which we go in \u0026 out of and was never removed.  We brought our concerns to both the attention of Wanda and Airbnb as I believe we were exposed to health dangers that should be brought to the attention of the County and State Agencies Of Hawaii.  Photos were taken and presented to all parties involved.\n\nWe were so uncomfortable we began looking for other accommodations after one night.  While bringing these multiple problems to Wanda's attention, she was unwilling or concerned enough to resolve any of the problems we identified and we were charged for three nights which was her minimal requirement.  I absolutely do not recommend the Ohana House as a vacation stay and in fact raise a RED FLAG WARNING.  It appears to be a bait-and-switch where you stay one night and then charged for three."},{"_id":"211868554","date":{"$date":"2017-11-14T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13372754","reviewer_id":"149309413","reviewer_name":"聖子","comments":"Wanda’s “Ohana house “was amazing!;)\nShe is a great artist.

If stargazing, falling asleep around a roaring fire, short drives to beautiful destination hikes and sometimes a rooster wandering around (that you aren’t particularly sure where it came from or exactly where it disappeared to but it’s in the mix anyhow) are your idea of vacation - then book Ohana House today! \n\nIf you are looking for close access to a white sand beach and a Piña Colada while you watch beautiful surfers touch each other playfully, Yacht Rock playing in the cabana behind you - thisisnotwhatyouarelookingfor.\n\nVacation responsibly and book the place that’s right FOR YOU.

The large underground parking is well lit, clean and roomy making manouvering our car very easy. It has direct elevator access to the apartment above, so unloading and loading the car was very convenient.\n\nThe area around the apartment has stores, restaurants, a Mercadona Supermarket, and many smaller grocery stores. The sidewalks are broad and evenly graded which makes for easy walking, and clean.\n\nPublic buses are frequent and easy to use, and there is an underground Metro station nearby within easy walking distance.\n\nDavid was what I would call a super host. His apartment was well equipped with every modern convenience and very clean. It was also very well stocked with food; bread, milk, juice, fresh fruit, butter, coking oil, etc., including a bottle of wine.\n\nHe patiently and carefully explained the works of every appliance in the apartment, including the use of the television features, and he made sure you are aware that he is available for any question later on. Communicating in English was not a problem.\n\nWe greatly appreciated the considerable time he spent providing us with detailed explanation of all the major attractions of Barcelona and how to get there. His Guest Guidebook includes all the details one could possibly ever need while in Barcelona, from managing emergency situations, using public transport, maps, to restaurants, shops, museums and all major attractions. Our visit to Barcelona was made much easier because of the book, and we learned a lot more.\n\nWe would recommend anyone visiting Barcelona to use David's place. We will definitely return to David's apartment if we should want to visit Barcelona again. The five days we were there were not enough.\n"},{"_id":"141094212","date":{"$date":"2017-04-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13382536","reviewer_id":"84315133","reviewer_name":"Samuel","comments":"David a un accueil convivial et très précis avec toutes les informations dont vous avez besoins.L'appartement est bien placé, agréable et chaleureux.Nous y retournerons sans hésiter."},{"_id":"142777648","date":{"$date":"2017-04-09T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13382536","reviewer_id":"74509541","reviewer_name":"Laurie","comments":"Nous avons passé un agréable séjour dans l'appartement de David.

That's reason enough to chose to stay at Centric Boutique at the Beach.  What comes as a bonus is David, a host who takes pride in what he does and who understands that \"goodwill is everything\".  It is no surprise that the owner has been awarded the Tripadvisor Certificate of Excellence.  \n\nDavid keeps in touch, checking in to see if/what there is anything we need, in addition to recommending places to visit.  It's not just lip service.  For example, we suggested he consider adding a mat in the bathtub, which could be a bit slippery.  Later that day, DONE.\n\nFor example, when it was was time to vacate after our ten-day stay, we asked if would do us the favour of arranging for a mini-van to pick us up at 5:30am, as we were taking a train on to San Sebastian, and couldn't risk any misunderstanding if we tried booking this ourselves.  After checking around, David came back with an answer.  The going rate was too high and he was still looking to find us much more reasonable transportation.  He DID.\n\nThis beautifully decorated, two-bedroom apartment is everything as described, well-equipped, well-stocked, clean and comfortable with a lovely balcony and close to all amenities.  \n\nDo we recommend it, most definitely YES."},{"_id":"188373685","date":{"$date":"2017-08-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13382536","reviewer_id":"139956241","reviewer_name":"Glenn","comments":"Our stay at David's apartment was everything it was supposed to be and so much more.

He took care of us before we even arrived. He explained how to get to the apartment in the best way. And he was there when we came. Ready to tell us everything. You can ask him about even unexpected things about your stay and be sure he will find an answer in a very short time. How to get to any museum or tourist attraction, where to go in Barcelona,  what to do with kids, where to go to a whole day journey outside the town etc. He's knowledge about Catalonia's history and Catalan architecture is unbelievable. We spending a whole week in Barcelona with our little daughter. She was so happy possessing her own room so she would not go outside. She told us every day she find herself as a princess. She's eight and believe me, she will never said this in our flat. The apartment is amazing. Full of every conveniences you need. Honestly, we haven't got in our own kitchen so many stuff. The apartment is stylish and cosy. So you could feel very comfortable here during your stay. If you need coffee you could make it in many ways, you could cooked here, prepared a dishes, and what it's really really awesome, you could spend a whole evening or night on a lovely terrace. But who wants to stayed on a terrace in Barcelona? If you decided to explore a town, you will find in David's apartment a special guide book which he prepared for his guests. You can't miss it. It's huge as an Encyclopedia Britannica. Neighbours are friendly, you will find a nice bakery and full equipped stores just around the corner. Location is just excellent. Lovely beach is a few blocks from your apartment, underground station just five minutes by walk. Bus stop is on the same corner as a David's apartment. It's hard to believe, but yes. You will find there everything what every high-maintenance resident need. So, if you really want to enjoy your stay at Barcelona, choose this unusual opportunity for living. You will not regret.

We felt secure and safe in the area and the apartment had everything a family would need, including parking, great Wi-Fi, cable TV, good beds, good space and all the amenities of home. The host was incredibly accommodating, informative and friendly. Here is my note to the owner -  We are back in the States after a very long journey with a cancelled flight!! We truly enjoyed staying with you and your help and hospitality was greatly appreciated. The thoroughness that you went through to ensure we knew the apartment well, the local area and the do's and don'ts in Barcelona, made our trip so much better. and of course thanks so so much for taking us to the airport on the last day, with the taxi strike, that would otherwise have been a big issue for us."},{"_id":"300404736","date":{"$date":"2018-08-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13382536","reviewer_id":"125832088","reviewer_name":"Kim","comments":"David is so hospitable.

He was very helpful in organizing the transportation to the unit(which was considerably less expensive than what I’d found online, worked out to 40€ one way and 45€ the other but there are 5 of us so need a bigger taxi) and was waiting when we got there. The hop-on hop-off bus stops nearby which was handy for us and there were many nice restaurants nearby as well as the beach, though wouldn’t recommend the beach. We were coming back from Croatia, they’re much nicer there. To be fair my understanding is most locals go to the beach outside the city where it’s quieter and nicer.

David's knowledge of Barcelona's history is incredible; he was able to help us plan out our stay, and make the most out of our experience. The value that he provides simply by being knowledgeable of the city and its best attractions is almost worth the price of staying at his apartment.

We loved staying away from the busy part of the city and close to the beach. Even though it's cold in November, we went over to the beach almost every day. The sunrises were stunning!  It was very nice to be in a quiet neighborhood and felt great to be out of the touristy areas. There is a grocery store just a few blocks away and a delicious bakery on the next block. Fresh croissants are the best! \n\nDavid was very helpful and showed the apartment and also offered to tell us all about seeing the city. He communicated through the Airnbn app during the week to make sure all was okay. The best thing was the refrigerator was stocked with water, milk, orange juice, water and even butter and jam. There was coffee and some muffins and toasts for the morning. What a nice touch to see a bowl of fresh fruit on the kitchen table. After a long day of travel, it was very nice to not have to worry about those things needed for the morning. \n\nThe apartment is in a very quiet area with a balcony and windows that look out onto a park. We couldn't hear any cars or traffic at all.\n\nI will definitely recommend the apartment to others. Even though it's a distance from the main part of the city, the Metro is SO easy to use and we could easily get to all of our destinations. We became Metro experts. What a fantastic transit system.

David contacted us professionally before our stay so we knew he would be good, but he certainly hit it out of the park with his incredible information about the area, perfectly clean apartment, all the thoughtful extras and the taking care of any question or problem we had (none with the apartment, but we almost missed our flight and he was a great help). David is the most thoughtful, gracious host.\nHe provided us with all the information we needed and showed us around. The apartment is just perfect! Kitchen is roomy, and it contains everything one needs.\nThe beds are comfortable, bathroom and terrace overlooking a nice courtyard with olive trees, are excellent. Location is incredible right near all the transportation lines (we never needed to cab it other than our manic ride to the airport when I mixed up our departure time by several hours, metro and bus is right there to all of Barcelona).\nDavid had excellent restaurant, sightseeing and transportation recommendations and was of great help.  He shares everything he knows abour Barcelona, and it is comprehensive. He went way beyond anything I would call usual (though it seems to be for him) to make our long-weekend comfortable and memorable. I consider him a friend now!\nQuiet neighborhood. Seems to be a lot of families here and it is very safe. You can walk here at any time, day or night. There is a cooking school right across the street and it was a great deal. 2 blocks over we attended an arts festival, the beach is 2 blocks the other way. On Sunday, we actually walked from La Rambla, to the seaport, down the beach and then to the apartment, seeing sights, people, entertainers and every type of food, beer and wine. What a great place.\nWe could go on and on, but to summarize, this is a great, roomy apartment, fullequipped, central to all transportation, right near the beach, restaurants and things to do right nearby, David is fantastic (best host ever!). We hope to go back soon."},{"_id":"416202436","date":{"$date":"2019-02-24T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13382536","reviewer_id":"108103876","reviewer_name":"Paul","comments":"A fabulous apartment in a great location, quiet, but convenient for public transport, shops restaurants etc. David was a very thorough host, giving lots of excellent tips \u0026 advice.

The apartment has everything you need to cook, although it’s a shame not to try the restaurants nearby. There are some lovely colourful touches that make it feel homely. Only thing we found unusual is being charged for electricity usage during the stay, but I guess if someone keeps the air con on the whole time then it adds up.

Talvez no verão fique quente, mas tem ar condicionado. A localização é perfeita e é talvez o ponto mais forte do apto! Muito silencioso (tirando algum barulho eventual de vizinhos), perto da praia, da Lagoa e com tudo em volta. Os anfitriões foram super gentis. Facilidades como um carrinho para compras são um mimo apreciado! Funcionários do prédio muito atenciosos também. Detalhe apenas para a capacidade do apto: não recomendo mais do que duas pessoas, pois só tem um banheiro, a cama de casal é pequena e se abrir a bicama na sala não há espaço para mais nada, principalmente malas (já que no quarto só há um armário pequeno). Eu fui com a minha mãe e dormi na sala para termos mais conforto e individualidade, então para nós foi bom (e guardei tudo no armário).

The exercise area in the hotel is literally 2 worn down treadmills that out outside next to a lat pull down machine that didn’t look very clean or inviting. The host did allow me to check out an hour after my checkout time which made up for not being let in until 445 when air b\u0026b said I could check in at 3. Other than that it was in a good location.

The ORM was born of the combination of the main passions of its founders: the city of Porto and its cultural characteristics; the architecture and decoration; the gastronomy and photography and, above all, the contact with different cultures.\r\n\r\nThe project is based on the support and guidance of property owners located in the center of the city who want to direct their homes to the tourism market.\r\n\r\nIt also involves the design and decoration of these same spaces, giving them a unique identity that translates into the extremely positive reaction of our guests.\r\nOur project culminates in the total management of the property, which includes the organization and preparation of these spaces for the tourist rental.\r\nSo with our dedication and daily work we have been able to please our guests who show the highest intention of repeating their experiences with our team. \r\nIn addition, besides the management, we are responsible for the constant guests' contact and that we privelege the personalized accompaniment - what distinguishes us and allows us a greater proximity to the diverse cultures.\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nQuatro amigos, muitos sonhos, um caminho em comum\r\n\r\nOporto Rental Management surgiu em 2015 pela vontade de quatro jovens amigos: a Rosa, a Tânia, o Igor e o Nuno.

We checked in on Friday afternoon and only realised the problem on Friday night after going out for dinner. So we sent them email. Their office was close on Saturday and Sunday. But they reported that no problems were found. We wore jackets in the apartment to keep us warm until check out on Tuesday. We have a similar problem with the hot water. The hot water is not enough for 2 people to take showers. So the first night was very bad. The hot water was gone after my friend put shower gels and shampoo, so she had to take a cold shower. I felt very sorry for her as I choose the apartment. But the staff reported that everything was okay.

La ubicación es impecable, al lado de la catedral. Se ventila a través de dos balcones que dan a la calle Chá, y desde los que se ve en un lateral la Catedral. \nEl apartamento está muy nuevo y todo de diseño. Tiene abundante agua caliente y climatización. La zona de dormitorio esta separada de la zona de estar a través de un pasillo, en el cual se ubica el baño. Dicha zona se puede independizar del resto con una corredera y una puerta intermedia. En la zona de estar se ubica una pequeña cocina, una mesita de comedor con dos sillas y un amplio sofá esquinero convertible en cama auxiliar. La cocina es pequeñita, pero tiene las cosas necesarias para pasar unos días, incluido lavavajillas y microondas.\nEn la planta baja se encuentra una oficina desde donde se gestionan los apartamentos, cuatro en total en ese edificio, uno por planta. \nLas personas que nos atendieron fueron muy amables, nos explicaron en español lo que podíamos ver en la ciudad y los temas propios del checking y nos permitieron dejar las maletas allí unas cuantas horas más el dia de salida."},{"_id":"288221517","date":{"$date":"2018-07-09T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13433868","reviewer_id":"158870873","reviewer_name":"Alison","comments":"The apartment was brilliant.

I'm going to take the same approach as the previous reviewer - pros and cons.\nPros\nGood communication from Christine\nGreat location. Near amazing restaurants and steps to the subway\nRemodeled, clean bathroom and kitchen\nCons\nThe building the apartment is in is dirty and has a horrible odor, which permeates the studio.\nThe linens are old. The towels are mismatched, as if they were friends' or family's castoffs - it was odd.\nThe pillows were old, again, as if they were castoffs from somewhere. I contacted Christine about this, and she reimbursed us for buying some new pillows. The pillow and linen comments may seem picky, but, combined with the smells, the dirty pillows just made everything feel dirty - even though the apartment itself is clean.\nAll in all, we would not stay in this apartment again."},{"_id":"238742908","date":{"$date":"2018-02-26T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13436132","reviewer_id":"30480729","reviewer_name":"Anniken","comments":"Christine’s appartment is right in the center of everything.

They always responded me in a swift manner with good solutions to all of my minor issues (including the early arrival, coffee machine repair, cleaning service question and light bulb request). \nI liked the apartment very much. It was convenient to do anything in the city and quiet and comfortable to sleep at night. To highlight the convenience, I want to note that the nearest supermarket is just one or two blocks away (to the north) and pubs and restaurants are also a block away (to the south). Some may worry about bugs at such location, but during my 40-day stay, I did not have any bug issues. \nThe only possible setbacks I can think of are the tiny kitchen sink and occasional odor from outside. \nThe kitchen sink is certainly small although this place has a dishwasher. So, for a short stay and people who do not cook very much will not have any problems. However, if you want to do dishes during your stay, you will probably find the sink space cramped. \nThe outside smell was very occasional during my stay in a rainy summer (I think it was related to the weather). When I noticed the weird smell, I just needed to close the windows to shut it out. The AC works very well. So, it was not a big deal for me to do so. \nOverall, I am happy with the values and qualities I got here, and I would highly recommend this place to anybody who wants to enjoy the city activities and have good rests in the same time."},{"_id":"138691280","date":{"$date":"2017-03-20T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"13437841","reviewer_id":"120799515","reviewer_name":"Leon William","comments":"Unfortunately very disappointed with the overall listing description which does not accurately reflect any similarities to the actual apartment at all..

The apartment is beautifully appointed, fresh spotless linen, a bowl of fruit, chocolates, and even an array of teabags and biscuits to have with my coffee. Such a lovely surprise. It's a spacious apartment with two beautiful bathrooms and amazing views. Even a large balcony with deck chairs. This apartment truly had everything we needed. There was a chemist near the ground floor doors, and a convenience store as well; coffee shops and cafes are nearby, and an excellent DFO shopping centre nearby (within walking distance; 1.3km I think).

He met us at the airport and transported us to his apartment despite the fact that one of our group arrived on an earlier flight. This was great as we arrived on the eve of the Olympics opening ceremony when traffic was at a peak!!\r\nOn arrival at the apartment he had filled the fridge with some goodies and put lots of cleaning equipment in the cupboards for our 10 day stay.\r\nAgain this was not really what we expected but it was lovely to get up on our first morning and have breakfast already in our cupboards without having to seek out the local supermarket.\r\nThe apartment was brand new and had no furniture in it when we looked on the website but Jorge was true to his word and all the furniture was in place for our arrival.\r\nWe had wi fi access which we didn't expect! This was a bonus as we were swimming coaches and it allowed us to keep up to date with work while we were away.\r\nThe apartment had a washing machine which we utilised to keep our supply of towels nice and fresh.\r\nWe could not fault the available furnishings and could have used much more e.g. barbeque facilities on our balcony, but we were too busy attending all the swimming sessions.\r\nThe location opposite the Olympic Park was superb for us as we were attending all the swimming sessions. 5 mins walk took us into the Park which was superb!! No busing and train journeys between sessions. A bit more complex when I travelled to the athletics but the transport system linked well.\r\nBefore going to Rio we were slightly worried about security but in this complex there was a security guard in place at the entrance to the apartment and also barriers at the end of the street. The guard was extremely pleasant on our entry and exits of the complex.\r\nJorge supplied us with information about where to eat in the local area and also took Matt and myself on a day trip to see the sights of Rio before our departure.\r\nWe both had a fantastic day with breakfast on Copacabana Beach. A trip up Sugarloaf Mountain to experience the most fantastic views over Rio. Lunch in Downtown Rio and then taken home.

He thoroughly explained how everything is the apartment worked. Even stocked the fridge and cabinets with milk, water, and snacks. It's the little things that set people apart. He was so helpful and even volunteered to take us to the airport for free! I would highly recommend this place"}]}
