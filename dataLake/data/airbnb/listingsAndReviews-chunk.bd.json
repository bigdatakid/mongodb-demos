This Chelsea location is as perfect as it gets...centrally located to an increasingly charming part of town, and delightfully quiet (no street noise AT ALL). Jay and his colleague Mara were both extremely available and helpful, accommodating our unusual arrival and departure hours, and checking in via text to make sure we had everything we needed. On a personal note, I felt a kinship seeing Jay's personality reflected in the apartment, which is simply but stylishly furnished with a mix of modern design and Asian pieces, with an artistic nod to his clear love of animals both domestic and wild. While apartment doesn't feature an abundance of natural light, it's worth the trade-off for peace and quiet -- and there's ample greenery out the windows. Separate kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom in addition to a living room make this a pretty spacious place by New York standards! Overall, we felt grateful for Jay's generosity in opening his home so we, too, could get a taste of Chelsea living. P.S. there is an Intelligentsia coffee bar at the pricey High Line Hotel around the corner on 10th Ave."},{"_id":"14510438","date":{"$date":"2014-06-21T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2482036","reviewer_id":"8143909","reviewer_name":"John","comments":"We found the description of the apartment to be accurate.

He checked in periodically regarding our arrival, satisfaction with the apartment, and departure plans.\r\nThe Chelsea location is ideal for exploring that part of Manhattan.  There are many great small neighborhood restaurants in the area and plenty of shopping.  It's a low rise residential neighborhood far less noisy and congested than other parts of NYC.\r\nThe most satisfying aspect of the apartment itself is the quietness.  It's rare to be able to escape the barrage of traffic and construction noise in Manhattan.  So, it was nice to come home to a guaranteed peacefull setting with a pleasant north-facing courtyard view.\r\nThe apartment itself was fine although the quality is a tad less that represented by the photos.  It reminded me of an apartment I might have rented right out of college with a cobbled together collection of furnishings, pots and pans and hand-me-down appliances.  Nevertheless, the location, size, quiet and first floor walk-up made up for those minor shortcomings."},{"_id":"18536611","date":{"$date":"2014-08-28T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2482036","reviewer_id":"329027","reviewer_name":"Pedro","comments":"O apartamento é fantástico com uma decoração muito cuidada.\r\nEstá muito bem localizado e a vizinhança é muito tranquila.\r\nO serviço foi excelente.\r\nNada a criticar.\r\nFicámos fãs e tentaremos reservá-lo novamente na nossa próxima visita a NY.\r\nMuito bom.

The French bistro on 9th was wonderful, we ate lunch and dinner.

Some great  eateries in the location, we ate in this area most nights and the Rail Line Diner on the corner was our breakfast pit stop every day.

It was in a great location (could walk easily up or downtown), only a short walk to the subway, great wifi and access to cable tv and Netflix as well as being super quiet.

The apartment was spacious, with lots of room in the living room, bedroom, and dining nook.  The fact that it is on the first floor is a plus and we certainly had no concern with privacy or security (the apartment is at the rear of the building and there is plenty of space with trees to the building behind).  The apartment also is extremely quiet, with few if any sounds from the tenants beside or above us.  The building is clean and obviously well cared for.    \n\nThe neighborhood is ideal:  a tree-lined street with a seminary occupying much of the other side of the street, subways within a block and a half, about 27 restaurants within a two block radius, plenty of stores nearby for anything you might need, lots of galleries on 10th Avenue and beyond, and the High Line within a block.

Quite possibly our premiere AIR experience to date.Everything we needed in a nifty, convenient and personable neighborhood.\nNeighbors friendly and a QUIET and fashionable space. Comfy bed, good hot water supply all kitchen essentials including full oven/stove, microwave and toaster oven. Restaurants recommended were spot on. We loved Meatball, Billy’s Cakes .the Empire Diner and the French bakery one corner away on 9th, authentic French pastries and they packed an amazing Beef Burgunione to go for us. La Grainee also great.\nWe relished our usual Museum overload, the all stars plus the petite Neue across from the Guggenheim.Austrian art including Klimt’s  Woman in Gold of his cousin Adele.  Do not miss a meal in their authentic Austrian cafe, best spatzle ever ! Discovered the FIT MUSEUM , a Fashion museum, free entrance that is open 12:00 to 20:00. We luckily saw “ PINK” and a fabric exhibition.\nChelsea Market easily walkable on the glorious HIGHLINE. BEWARE that it is uncomfortably clogged on the weekends, at least in the afternoon. The soup take out stand is yummy. Visited Nola neighborhood and it is the most chic, highest density of SUPER ELITE shops I have ever seen and I have been to Paris many times ! I honestly felt intimidated ! Long lines for entry to restaurants were so lengthy that they barricaded access to many shops even if you wanted to buy a $200 candle ! Granted, it was a Sunday. \nSoho was far more civilized and  Le Lauderre cafe dininitely worth a little French splurge. Winter salad of pumpkin purée topped with delicate slices of delicata squash, a full burrata, pumpkin seeds and other ingredients. My husbands morel omelette was perfect and we shared a very generous and delightful sundae of coffee ice cream with nut brittle and fresh whip cream toppings.\nAs an avid knitter I was transfixed in Purl Soho, a knitters Mecca including a plentiful supply of Liberty fabrics , chic jewelry making supplies, unique notions and a charming staff. Upper East Side/Madison stroll still lovely. Eataly yummy and you’ll pay for it ! Then sadly, we ran out of time.\nHighlight was Andrea BOCELLI at Madison Square Garden ! A dreamy dream COME TRUE for me.\nGet thee to NYC taking comfy shoes.\nALR"},{"_id":"368637747","date":{"$date":"2019-01-07T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2482036","reviewer_id":"190019719","reviewer_name":"Krysthel","comments":"I got this place for my parents who were visiting for a week.

She reached out to me a week prior to my stay to provide me with all the information that I needed to know. She was always so prompt with her responses when I asked for more information about the food places that I could go. The stay has exceeded my expectation. She provided amenities including hair dryer which saved me the trouble of bringing my own! There were cups and kettle to boil water. Bath and face towels. Soap and shampoo. Toilet paper and refills of toilet paper. Little decorations to brighten up the room. Bathroom is of reasonable size and there is hot water. Water pressure is good and air-conditioning has different modes to adjust temperature. The room is cleaned up everyday and I always come back to a cleaned and turned down room ready for sleep. Feels like a hotel stay! No doubt the room is tiny but the size is perfect for a single traveler who needs a cozy, comfortable, clean and safe space to rest for the night. It is also very convenient to travel around from the Airbnb place as it is located just next to the MTR station and the airport bus stop is right outside the building. You can easily find cafes, restaurants and eateries nearby. The location is safe and the building has a security guard too. Highly recommended for single female traveler. You can reach out to Yuki for questions and she will be ready to answer you.

It is cozy enough for one and Yuki gave great recommendations for places to see and eat on the second day.\n\nHowever, there were some things I wish could have been better. One, if you're a light sleeper I would maybe recommend elsewhere - you can hear other rooms opening and closing their doors. In addition, upon arrival areas such as the desk had dust and hair particles which made me feel a bit uncomfortable. Lastly, even though I had asked the host twice for the housekeeping not to come into my room, someone had come into the room the next day when I was out.

There was also an option for storing your luggage after check out which I am sure many travellers will appreciate greatly. The building itself had security available, locked the doors at night (you could still buzz yourself in) and Yuki’s place was secured by a coded electronic lock. The room had a double locking system as well. Made me feel very safe which I think is quite important for many travelers who travel by themselves. \n\nYuki was flawless as a host: from providing you with a guide on how to get to her place with pictures from the airport to listing all amenities available and giving you some restaurant tips, she truly outshined many other hosts whom I had the pleasure to stay with. Despite not meeting her in person, she has regurly checked up on me and made sure I had everything I needed.\n\nLittle cons to the place:\n1) if you take long showers (like me) and you’re not careful enough - the water from the bathroom will slightly leak out into the room. (Or might have been a malfunction specifically in my room). For those unfamiliar, many Asian bathrooms are designed only to contain the shower head going firectly from the wall without an actual stand to save up on space.\n\n2) Thin walls. On my last night, I could clearly hear some guests laughing and talking loud. You can also hear the main door and any doors of the other rooms to bang as people entered and went out. I personally did not mind - Hong Kong is known for this general problem, but sensitive sleepers might want to reconsider."},{"_id":"415166904","date":{"$date":"2019-02-22T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"24825256","reviewer_id":"195419342","reviewer_name":"Iris","comments":"房间的性价比超高~地点交通方便,出门就是地铁口,房间干净整洁,本来以为要下午三点多才能入住,结果当天11:30左右就能入住啦,房东也很nice,会关心住得习不习惯,还推荐了一堆附近的美食｡唯一不足就是房间小了些,还有就是空调好像没办法调温度半夜开空调太冷,不开又太热…不过在可理解范围内~总之很不错~❤️"},{"_id":"417388948","date":{"$date":"2019-02-27T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"24825256","reviewer_id":"188092868","reviewer_name":"见娇娇","comments":"地理位置很方便 房东很热情 总之更推荐"},{"_id":"417629222","date":{"$date":"2019-02-28T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"24825256","reviewer_id":"196742823","reviewer_name":"茜","comments":"房间小,其他没缺点｡"}]}

These two are of such an importance to me that, and even do the renting price is very competitive, I have to drop a star for each one of them. The road in front is just very very noisy. With cars running all night long on a cobbled road. The windows should really be improved to provide better sound insulation. If one is prone to trouble falling asleep on noise environments, he is definitely going to find it hard to fall a sleep in this flat. As for the mattress, it just is a cheap foam mattress, you're bound to sink on it.

El recibimiento fue maravilloso. Teníamos fruta fresca a nuestra disposición e incluso unas riquísimas magdalenas caseras hechas por la esposa del Sr. Sobral. Su atención y amabilidad han sido insuperables.\r\n\r\nEn cuanto al apartamento se puede resumir en tres palabras: \"No falta nada\". Es realmente increíble. Es que, de verdad, no falta nada, pero nada de nada. Lo tiene todo. Tiene televisión por cable, wifi, cadena musical. La cocina esta absolutamente equipada: sartenes, cazos, aceite, microondas, lavavajillas, lavadora, calentador de agua (kettle), horno normal, tostadora, cafetera para hacer café italiano y cafetera para hacer café americano. Por supuesto, mantel, servilletas, platos, vasos, cubiertos, cubre manteles.., Si por tener hasta tenía vino, café, té e incluso media docena de huevos en la nevera. Mayonesa, kétchup... Es que es increíble!!!\r\n\r\nEl baño impecable de limpio.\r\n\r\nLa habitación, sencilla pero correcta y limpia.\r\n\r\nY tiene garaje privado, en un patio interior.\r\n\r\nEn resumen, es un apartamento de 10 sobre 10. Lo tiene todo. Está amueblado con muebles de IKEA, moderno y práctico. Sencillo pero muy acogedor.\r\n\r\nAún encima está situado extraordinariamente bien. A 3 minutos andando de la rúa do Carmo, a 4 minutos de la Torre de los Clérigos y de la librería (de Harry Potter) Lello e irmao. a 6 de la plaza da Liberdade.\r\n\r\nEs un auténtico lujazo.

There's a garage for your car, and if you are travelling without a car there are key bus routes right outside the flat as well as the open-top tour bus. Good local shops for food, and brilliantly placed for key sights and bars and restaurants. The park and duck ponds outside are a pleasant bonus and makes the apartment feel calm and relaxing. Carlos is friendly, easy-going and helpful. A pleasure to meet. He was there to show us all the main features of the apartment and then left us to enjoy our stay.

Miguel was very flexible with regards to our check-in time, and showed us to a parking spot within the courtyard of the building, which was unexpected but welcome.\r\n\r\nMiguel was extremely kind and attentive and really took the time to explain to us where to find the best spots in town - known and less well-known - for exploring as well as dining. The apartment was clean, spacious, light and quiet at night. The bed is very comfortable and the bathroom very well equipped. The kitchen had everything we needed. We explored Porto on foot from the apartment and didn't need to use any public transportation. The only potential downside to the apartment are the construction works that are ongoing next door, which started at 8AM during our stay. For us this was not a problem, because we intended to get up early anyway, but if you intend to sleep in then I recommend bringing ear plugs.

The location is very convenient for access to the Old Town section of the city--the place to be in our opinion--an easy walk away.

The apartment was easy enough to find via (Hidden by Airbnb) maps. \n\nOne of the best things about the apartment has to be the off street parking,\nas parking in Porto can be a nightmare! The parking spaces were secure out the back of the building accessible by remote control.\n\nCarlos was an absolutely amazing host providing some excellent food recommendations which made our stay in Porto all the better. He obviously has a passion for food as well! \n\nThe apartment itself is a walk up with lots of space, modern and completely furnished with everything you could need for your stay (washer, hairdryer, iron, lots of towels, full kitchen etc). The space is big and the apartment has a really nice feel to it with wooden floors. \n\nOn first entering the apartment it did smell a little damp, however we soon realised the whole city of Porto can be like that (hence the need for tiles). But after keeping the windows open for a while on a hot sunny day it was fine. \n\nDuring the time of our stay (early June) there was also some construction nearby which commenced daily at 9am, but luckily we were always up before then, so it didn't impact us. \n\nThe location of the apartment is great and wishing walking distance of most of the major sights, although not in the centre of town so still nice and not overly touristy. \n\nOverall we loved our stay in the apartment would definitely stay again if we get the chance to go back to Porto!

We werden op he afgesproken uur warm ontvangen door Miguel ( de zoon) die ons een duidelijke uitleg gaf over alles in het appartement en ook vele nuttige tips over de bezienswaardigheden, restaurants en winkels in Porto. Het appartement is voorzien van alles wat nodig is en voldoet volledig aan de beschrijving. Het is op wandelafstand van het centrum en openbaar vervoer is letterlijk voor de deur. We waren met de wagen en de afgesloten privé-parking was niet alleen veilig maar een absolute meerwaarde in een omgeving waar parkeerplaats zeer schaars is.

The apartment was clean and it had all the amenities we needed. The air conditioner was a bit noisy but it worked well. The Murphy bed was very comfortable. \n\nThere were laundry machines in the building but you needed to pay to use them. \n\nNatasha put together a very informative local guide book and she passed along unused transit passes that were left behind by her previous guests. Natasha is a kind and flexible host. She let us check in a bit early and met us at the apartment to explain everything we needed to know. She responded promptly to all messaging.\n\nMy only criticism of Natasha's place is that it was on the ground floor right beside a very busy sidewalk. The only window faced the sidewalk, which afforded absolutely no privacy if the curtains were left open. This is just simply the design of the apartment, not much that can be done. However, if you can find reasonably priced accommodation  that faces the ocean or is on a higher floor it may be worth spending the extra money for the scenic views and added privacy."}]}

The studio flat is perfect for two, with all the amenities, and extra touches like coffee, milk, hair dryer, beach towels and nice linens and toiletries. \n\nVivian also offered us a late checkout and did her best for an early one but we didn’t end up needing it.\n\nHer place is a short 7-8 minute walk downhill through a park to the quieter Bronte beach. It’s also about a 30 minute walk along the coastal cliffs to Bondi. \n\nAll in all it was exactly what what we wanted and we wish we could have stayed longer."},{"_id":"346809154","date":{"$date":"2018-11-10T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"24863216","reviewer_id":"23730094","reviewer_name":"Cristian","comments":"Great cosy spot near one of Sydney’s great beaches."},{"_id":"347792234","date":{"$date":"2018-11-11T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"24863216","reviewer_id":"205650175","reviewer_name":"Lizzy","comments":"Vivian’s place was modern, well furnished and clean!

I primarily travelled with Uber Pool, but it was also very close in terms of public transportation options. Loved the beach towels and beach bag and the brand new shower.

The bathroom was also not in a great shape, there was a hole where the toilet paper role was but it got fixed the very next day, which was great. The unfortunate part is that we didn't realize it was a shared bathroom with other guests which was quite annoying as we are quite picky people . It is mentioned under house rules that it is a  shared bathroom. I wish this was written upfront on the summary page. Also whenever we wanted to go back to the house we had to call the host as we did not have the keys. The host was very accommodating but we felt bad going late.

Очень много посуды. \r\nЕдинственный минус - сосед снизу, который не выносит какого либо шума. Леонор нас предупредили при заезде о нем, но когда он вышел из квартиры ругаться в тот же день по поводу шумного спускания пос. лестнице мы поняли насколько это серьезно. Дети не на шутку пере пугались, постоянно приходилось на них шикать, а сосед то и дело приходил и стучал к нам в дверь. При этом мы ни разу серьезно не шумели, так - дети пробежались, громко посмеялись и вуаля - злой сосед стучит к нам в дверь. На отдыхе это напрягает.\r\nНе рекомендуем семьям с детьми.

I could not have asked for a better host for our weekend getaway. \n\nThe place was fantastic. It is clean, modern, spacious and inviting. Plenty of clean linens and extra blankets. The patio and its large double sliding doors opens up the space to the outdoors. Access to the place is simple and off a main street. Parking can be tough to find at times if you do drive, but I find that true for Montreal generally speaking.\n\nLocation was convenient, about a 10 min uber ride to downtown. about a 5 min walk to the closest metro station. Close to some popular restaurants, most of which are about 15-20 min walk.\n\nHamza was a great host. Checked in with us to make sure things were going well. He was always helpful, responded quickly to enquiries and questions. Ensured that our stay was enjoyable and that was his top priority. I had peace of mind while we were at this place.\n\nI would definitely stay here again when visiting Montreal in the future!"},{"_id":"334920485","date":{"$date":"2018-10-10T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"25014628","reviewer_id":"1362545","reviewer_name":"Stéfanie","comments":"Wonderful apartment, conveniently and centrally located for those looking to explore the city.

For example, the one we stayed at did not have the livingroom couch that was in the photos and the space in general was really tiny. Due to high humidity there is also a specific smell in the whole apartment. Also, when booking, I was selecting the pet friendly places and even if this one showed up, I needed to change the sleeping arrangements for my friend traveling with a small dog as the owned did not accept pets in any way. Seems to me in Turkey there is an intolerance against pet dogs in general."}]}

It is in walking distance to Sao Bento station. We did not have a car as we walked everywhere in this beautiful city. The flat itself had all the basic amenities (including air conditioning) and was very clean. It was fairly loud due to its location on a busy street, but the noise did quiet down considerably after 23:00.

It is located right in the centre of porto, directly in the shopping street. You can reach everything by foot in a few minutes. The accommodation is a bit smaller than it appears in the pictures, but it is still enough place for two people. It has everything needed for a short stay in porto. The only thing, which was a bit disturbing for us at night, was that the accommodation is badly soundproofed. The steps and words spoken on the floor and in the other accommodations appear very loud.

We were met by a friend of the host on check-in, no recommendations for the city or restaurants but found a brochure on the table. It was good to have air conditioning in the apartment as it was hot during the visit. There was a coffee maker but the carafe was broken so we had to go out to the café in the morning.

Everything was clean and in great condition. We were so impressed with the quality of the apartment. When we booked, we wondered if the size of the space would be an issue, but the finishes are beautiful and the apartment is very well laid out, cozy, and highly functional. \n\nThe thing that really impressed us the most was how well equipped the kitchen was. As a couple who tends to cook a lot, this was greatly appreciated. We've noticed that a lot of Airbnb hosts say they have a well equipped kitchen, but they have just a few plates, glasses, and cutlery. This place has everything you would need: non-stick pans, nice knives, cutting boards, can opener, baking sheets, strainer, salad bowl, French press, toaster...everything. There was also oil, vinegar, coffee, etc. The kitchen also has a nice layout with great counter space and a bar to eat at.\n\nThe location is great. We were within walking distance to grocery stores, shops, pubs, and cafes. It was a nice neighborhood, quiet and safe. We also had no trouble walking from there to many of the attractions we wanted to see, including Old Montreal. However, the Metro is close by (Sherbrooke station) and can quickly get you anywhere you need to go.\n\nNikki and Jean-Louis were great hosts. We would definitely stay here again."},{"_id":"363823565","date":{"$date":"2018-12-29T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"25070084","reviewer_id":"124732967","reviewer_name":"Benoit","comments":"Excellent accueil, grande hospitalité de la par des hôtes, ils ont su bien nous accommoder.

A casa é muito confortável e está totalmente (Website hidden by Airbnb) a lareira e o aquecimento dá um conforto ainda maior. Receberam-nos bem e tinham tudo ao dispor para a nossa estadia. O único problema é não ter wi-fi e não ter rede em muitas partes da casa, o que por um lado pode até ser uma vantagem para uma estadia mais tranquila. Aconselho."}]}

Multiple beaches, restaurants, and shops are in walking distance- but we used our car daily to explore and drive to all the amazing sights Maui has to offer. Kevin was very quick to respond, and replaced a broken toaster right away. On a side note: We did encounter some critters in the apartment, and Kevin scheduled an exterminator to come by.

We were clearly their first guests. After a delayed check-in, we were greeted by broken window shutters and air conditioning units that didn’t function. The apartment lacked the WIFI, laptop friendly work space, and washer/dryer units which are included in the listing. The hosts behaved more like landlords and did not apologize or go out of their way to help us when problems came up. They only reluctantly put a bed frame in the second bedroom (I had to insist, repeatedly). They refused to compensate us for the WIFI we were forced to purchase, although WIFI was on the apartment listing. We later found out that the TV was not set up either, so we couldn't use it. The house lacked other essentials: a table to eat on, trashcans and trash bags, pots or pans, hangers for clothes or towels, napkins/washcloths, etc. Anyone looking to book the place should verify that these problems are solved before reserving, because the apartment could eventually become a nice spot to stay in. At the moment, though, it was a rather bumpy stay.\n"}]}

The flat was newly modernized, looking like a hotel room, in a building with about ten flats available for rent. The view was towards the sea and the Sugar Loaf mountain, so very beautiful. The internet is good, with a unique router for each apartment. The TV has about one hundred channels available, most in dubbed in Portuguese. The room comes furbished with a drawer in the wall, with a fridge, freezer, cooker, washing machine. Soap and shampoo is provided for the first day, and detergent enough for a month to wash cloths. \r\n\r\nThe hosts were very warm in welcoming me, providing advice about visiting Rio and a complex Rio tourist map (you can have this map from the airport as well, as well as other materials about tourism in Rio). One day when I lost the key, they waited me late at 11.30 when I arrived with a new set of keys. \r\n\r\nThe neighborhood of Santa Teresa is safe and well lit. But you should know the flat is on the top of the hill, and you need about 15 minute climb from the Gloria metro station or 10 minutes from Lapa and the famous stairs Selaron. However, there are also taxis by motorcycle for 3 reals from Metro Gloria, as well as buses that can take you to the Central Station for also 3 reals. Being at the top of the hill gives an amazing view over the city, especially the Sugar Loaf mountain. In front of the flat there is a small shop from where you can by water, beer, fruits and even pizza to go.  The Lapa neighborhood has many nice bars. And right on the hill there is the Museum of the Ruins, where on old house has been offered to the tourists to see the city from its top floors, given an even better view. \r\n\r\nAlso the price was very good for the quality.\r\n\r\nOverall, a great experience. I recommend it."},{"_id":"30982052","date":{"$date":"2015-04-30T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2515976","reviewer_id":"11181450","reviewer_name":"Meryem","comments":"Nous avons passé un super séjour dans l'appartement de Marcela et Frédérico!

Actually, it’s probably the most organized Airbnb that I’ve ever stayed at. Check-in and communication between the hosts was also excellent. Having said this, I don’t feel like the area is very safe. I have lived in Brazil for 5 years and am generally able to distinguish “safe” areas from “unsafe” areas and I do have to say that the area the loft is in, isn’t the safest. For you to have an idea, several Uber’s and Taxi drivers refused to go up the hill to drop me off because of the abundant number of assaults \u0026 robberies happening in the area. In addition, there are posters up all over the neighbourhood warning travelers about the real possibility of being robbed. So, getting around by foot especially at night is challenging and finding an Uber is equally as difficult. If you are okay with this, though, I’d recommended Frederico and Marcela’s place.

PS: foi um pouco difícil de chamar Uber de lá então, se precisarem de transporte, é melhor pedir com um tempo de antecedência e tentar outros aplicativos de táxi mesmo (foi como eu consegui)."},{"_id":"261994702","date":{"$date":"2018-05-07T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2515976","reviewer_id":"52936051","reviewer_name":"Vagner","comments":"Super indico!

Les lieux étaient propres et accueillants avec tout le confort et le nécessaire dont nous avions besoin. L’immeuble est sécurisé et est privé (uniquement voyageurs Airbnb a priori). Juste en bas il y a un petit commerce alimentaire qui dépanne bien. Santa Teresa se trouve à environs 30min de l’aéroport de Rio, 20-25min de Copacabana et Ipanema et à 5min de Lapa, quartier animé (vendredi et samedi) le soir avec des restaurants et des bars très sympas.

A anfitriã, Amelia, é de uma delicadesa e dedicação que supera as expectativas. Se quiser um deck privado, preste atenção para reservar o apartamento correto, pois existe a opção de deck compartilhado, que é mais barata. Também observe que somente algumas acomodações tem vista para o Pão de Açúcar, que é belíssima! As acomodações de frente para a rua serão muito confortáveis, mas não terão a vista do quarto, apenas das áreas comuns. O entorno é super agradável e tem opções de comida e boa música! O acesso aos andares é somente de escada, então, se for para algum andar distante do Térreo, leve isso em consideração caso algum hóspede tenha limitações para se locomover. No mais, a atenção da Amelia merece destaque por sua gentileza e carinho.

Rodapés e portas estão muito sujos, chão da cozinha e área desgastados, a porta do banheiro não tinha maçaneta na parte externa. São detalhes pequenos mas que melhorariam a sensação de conforto em estar longe de casa. A TV parou de funcionar após o primeiro dia de estadia, mas o Gustavo mostrou-se justo e solícito na resolução e se propôs a devolver 1 diária. Acho o preço justo pelo que oferece.

He’s not just renting you a room, he shares his home with his guests and does this with all his heart. On the first day he made an amazing dinner for us, taught me how to make Turkish tea and coffee, and told a lot of interesting things about Turkey that only local man knows. He also made a list of best places in Istanbul that are not crowded with tourists and where you can feel real Istanbul life (has anyone ever done this for you?!) The apartment is located in really quite and friendly area, no tourists, real local experience and good transportation options to go anywhere. The room is nice and clean and has amazing view to the city and Bosphorus. So if you want to escape noisy and crowded touristic places and get to know real Turkish life and hospitality, you should definitely choose Fatih’s place. I’m sure you’ll be surprised to see Turkey with his eyes! :)"},{"_id":"366038377","date":{"$date":"2019-01-02T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"25241699","reviewer_id":"223664205","reviewer_name":"Olga","comments":"Fatih is a great host, ready to help in different situations) \nPerfect location of the house, nice parks around, nothing of the usual touristic kind and very pleasant."}]}

From the Havabus station to the aparthotel is only 10 mins walk. Once we got there, we were welcomed nicely and the check-in went really smooth. \n\nThe room itself is like the pictures: neat, clean and modern. The bathroom is perfect as well. Everything you need is provided (clean sheets, comfortable bed, kitchenware, towels, hairdryer, soap, AC, etc.). The location is good: 10 mins walk to the Taksim square and to the metro line. \n\nÖmer is a great host; friendly, kind, patient, honest and always willing to help. His colleague too. \n\nThis aparthotel is one of the reasons why we enjoyed our stay in Istanbul. It's such a nice place to come 'home' after a long day of walking and sightseeing.

But all ways out of the port are the same.\nIt is basically mid distance between Guomao and Lohu metro stations. And that is also interesting, as there are more restaurants and malls in this area, actually more interesting than inside Lohu port.\nThe place is small but clean and tidy. It is perfect for 2 people for a short stay. Nice Japanese decoration."}]}
