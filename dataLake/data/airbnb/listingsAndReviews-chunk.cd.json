To this day you can still see the mansions left by the brewer's families. You can see them on Bushwick Avenue while you're walking from the train station!

Welcome and enjoy!","notes":"The train station is only 4 blocks away.  Shopping, Laundry, Groceries and fast food eateries are steps away from there.

Welcome to Bushwick.","transit":"The closest train station is located on Broadway \u0026 Gates Avenue on the J Train.

The apartment itself has original fireplaces, all new plumbing and electric. Just the perfect match of antique and modern, while still holding it's original integrity. Stephanie is also very fun to chat with; very knowledgeable about New York \u0026 the arts if that's what you're into. There's a corner store on the same block which is very convenient \u0026 the subway is about 3 blocks away.

Stephanie is a warm and welcoming host and this apartment is the perfect home-away-from home. It turned out to be exactly as depicted on the website (but larger than expected!), with a wonderful location close to the subway to allow us to easily explore Manhattan.\nThe living room was spacious and comfortable, the kitchen well-equipped, the bedrooms luxurious with comfortable beds and warm blankets, the building well-maintained and centrally located close to supermarkets, laundry, restaurants, subway and bus stops. All was spotlessly clean and the linens and towels generously supplied. The mid-week cleaning was an unexpected bonus. \nWe visited during winter and the central heating was warm and reliable and the apartment has its own hot water system so we never ran out of hot water!\nThe apartment could not be better located and Stephanie's suggestions both in person and in the binder in the apartment provided an insider's view of Brooklyn and Manhattan.\nEverything about our experience was first class and exceeded our expectations in every way. I would not hesitate to recommend this apartment to anyone travelling to Brooklyn or Manhattan - it is absolutely perfect!"},{"_id":"364331141","date":{"$date":"2018-12-30T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9703075","reviewer_id":"16309762","reviewer_name":"Gregory","comments":"Stephanie and Kevin were great.  They were always responsive to our questions and concerns whether by text or in person.  Location was primo:  Easy to get to Manhattan and other neighborhoods in Brooklyn, and having groceries and liquor stores nearby was nice.  Stephanie had some local suggestions that we took her up on and are glad we did.  Check out SEA (Thai-club-tropical-bar vibe), which had delicious, beautifully presented food and strong service.  Visiting NYC during Christmas has long been a goal of ours, and having a comfortable, close-in location helped make it a wonderful gift to ourselves.  We appreciated their hospitality and had a great time.  Two thumbs up and big recommendation for staying here."}]}

But, when work in Honolulu was done we knew we would want to get out of the city and really enjoy all the Oahu had to offer. So, after doing a lot of pre-trip comparisons to properties across the entire island, we chose Skye's Ocean Song beach house. We found the Waimanalo area to be a little gem - less-crowded than Kailu and the popular North Shore, while allowing easy access to them. And, we found this property to be the perfect base within Waimanalo. Some highlights:\n\n* A one minute walk from this property will put you on the sand of Waimanalo Beach. It is not private but very private 'feeling'. It was easy to take in a few sunrises and to jump in \u0026 out of the water without involving car rides. The beach itself was perfect for body-boarding with strong waves that break a little to close to shore for surfing. Yet, there was an excellent snorkel spot a mere two miles away (great recommendation from Skye). This property came generously equipped with boards, mats, an umbrella, and even beach towels. It will cut down on what you will have to spend.\n\n* This is a multi-unit property yet was a true 'entire property' reservation. We had our own parking, our own yard, our own patio, and our own gas grill - something we put to use multiple times to save $ and time.  The Ocean Song was is the perfect setting for the four of us, enough room and well-equipped.\n\n* Skye was the perfect hostess - accessible, knowledgeable, and eager to help. She seemed genuinely interested in us having the most enjoyment possible.\n\nIf one was to search for a downside in staying here, it might be the lack of immediate access to conveniences. Yet, this is exactly why we chose this property. The area is not over-developed. All of the grocery and other needs you may have can be found in a several minute car ride to Kailu. Then, you'll come back and be glad you did.\n\nAll told, we LOVED our stay here. The biggest disappointment was leaving. My first day back home and at work went okay. I did lay under my desk in a fetal position and cry for two hours. After that it was fine."},{"_id":"194977561","date":{"$date":"2017-09-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9714401","reviewer_id":"1106831","reviewer_name":"Lee","comments":"Our group of four had a fantastic stay at Skye's place in Waimanalo.

From fresh plumeria in the bathroom, to a shelf of page turners for your beach going there are lovely additions and helpful items in every inch of this bit of paradise. Besides the helpful travel guides in house, Skye is in fact the best guide of them all. Every tip she gave ended up as the highlights of the trip (From the best shrimp shack a few blocks away, to a beautiful local concert that was truly locals only).\n\nThe beach is a stone's throw and it is the best beach I've visited on Oahu. The sand is like flour, the waves are calm (perfect for boogie boarding), and it was almost entirely empty each time we went. The outdoor shower makes cleaning up after a breeze as well. \n\nI was expecting a nice stay at an airbnb, I wasn't expecting the whole wonderful package that is a stay at Skye's. It's a real home away from home feeling.  Mahalo, Skye!"},{"_id":"266936941","date":{"$date":"2018-05-20T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9714401","reviewer_id":"6327777","reviewer_name":"Jesse","comments":"Location was perfect.

A quick walk to the most beautiful beaches with strongest waves.  We felt like locals in that area.   Skye was a great host and very helpful with local suggestions.\n\nThe house wasn't quite as expected though.  The entire house is so hot.  Take your time away from the house when you can.  There are air conditioners in 2 rooms.  This house states that there is room for 5 but one guest had to sleep on the couch.  The other room was locked up and not accessible to guests.\n\nOverall, of course we had a great trip.

As soon as we had questions, put politely, about the unorthodox booking process, however Skye became suddenly hostile. This was. Very unpleasant experience I have never had during an Airbnb stay. Skye puts an added tax at the bottom of her description of the bungalow. You will not see it unless you read right to the end of the lengthy description. It does not appear on the ‘additional prices’, so it is very easy to miss. She only notified me about this extra substantial amount of money she wants in cash on top of the Airbnb fee once the bungalow was paid for in full and could not be cancelled. The worst of it though was she in fact sought to charge me even double this extra amount when she sent me a rental agreement after my reservation for almost $400. When I questioned her about this new arbitrary amount, which thank goodness I did instead of just paying it, she said it must have been an error. When I complained to Airbnb about all this conduct the person she had communicated with told me that Skye was so aggressive to her she was left trembling. I know that people have had good experiences with Skye, just beware of getting on her wrong side or questioning her questionable methods. \n\nAlso the house is far less private or close to the beach than the pictures misleadingly imply. It is attached to the main house and you are very much living in Skye’s shadow do to speak (see above).  In general the house feels very much in the middle of suburbia."},{"_id":"416629134","date":{"$date":"2019-02-24T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9714401","reviewer_id":"122369675","reviewer_name":"Chuck","comments":"Awesome place and awesome host.  There are many highlights, but at the top is the amazingly beautiful and totally uncrowded beach a half block from this place....I think it’s the best on the island.  The accommodations and host (Skye) are amazing too...you can’t help but relax and soak up the aloha spirit here.  Although this is a relaxed area, away from the bustle of Honolulu (great for families...we have an 8 yr old who loved it)  you can still get to good restaurants, bars, shops, and other amenities on the Windward side easily from here if you’d like...e.g. Kialua is 15 minutes.

The interior decor is tasteful and fits the setting beautifully.  We left the balcony door open every night and it was delightful to awake every morning to the view of the palm trees swaying in the breeze and to fall asleep to sound of the waves crashing on the beach. The pool and barbecue area is clean, quiet and very relaxing. We found that at this time of the year, the weather seemed to be much clearer here on the west coast and we had far more sun than we had found in Waikiki which was a bonus.  The ocean, right in our back yard was very tempting but the waves were really too strong to be able to swim safely during our week here.  Instead, we made great use of the Ko Olina lagoons about ten minutes down the road and had no trouble finding parking any time we went.  The drive to the end of the island is well worth it to see the beautiful expanse of almost deserted beaches. One drawback is the traffic noise from the highway but we kept the front door closed at all times and it blocked out most of it. Chase was very helpful and left a binder full of very good suggestions of restaurants and activities in the area.

The view is fantastic and the pool is very nice.  Having BBQ's at the pool is a nice feature.  The unit has most everything you need, although note dishes are done by hand and the clothes washer is a communal one.\n\nOur only negative has nothing to do with the unit or Dr. Chase, who is terrific to deal with.  It is the traffic in the area that is a pain.  There appears to be perennial construction, and it can be a slog trying to get somewhere south.  And there is a lot of stuff in Kapolei (about 10 miles south) that you might want, including grocery stores and restaurants.\n\nAll in all, we highly recommend Dr. Chase's beach hideaway.  If you want a quieter vacation than the norm, it would be hard to beat his condo."},{"_id":"205830541","date":{"$date":"2017-10-22T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9736844","reviewer_id":"57041849","reviewer_name":"Tessa","comments":"We spent our honeymoon here and let me tell you, it was an absolute dream; the photos don't even do the impact of the view justice.

A beautiful place with an amazing view.  We had a terrific stay here.  It had all of the basic amenities you'd expect in a quality Airbnb place.  Highlights include the view, easy access to the beach (more below), great recommendations for eating out.\n\nFor those considering staying in the future, it is probably worth noting a bit about the location.  It is at least 30 min out of town - - more in traffic.  Additionally, it isn't necessarily in the nicest part of town.  And while we felt safe the whole time (my wife went running by herself in the area) it was something we observed.  Finally, the condo backs right up to the main 2-lane road and as a light sleeper I had a hard time sleeping through the night due to the traffic.  Turning on the fan/AC helped reduce that.\n\nBut as far as value - - can't beat it.  We had a wonderful time and Dr. Chase was quick to answer questions and offer some great recommendations."},{"_id":"247248508","date":{"$date":"2018-03-27T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9736844","reviewer_id":"120624625","reviewer_name":"Kelly","comments":"Dr. Chase's place was exactly what I was looking for in a peaceful weekend at the beach with the intention to recharge and enjoy the beautiful surroundings.

You could definitely not ask for more with the amazing views and easy access to the beautiful private beach below. If you're looking to escape the hustle and bustle... have a beautiful beach to yourself... immerse yourself in the local relaxed culture then I definitely recommend Dr. Chase's place.

The beach is wonderful just watch for the rocks the waves uncover daily! Our first day we walked down the beach to the left and a giant sea turtle had come up on the beach! \nWe went to the end of the road Kaena Point State Park, we found that to be the closest and easy in and out beach ton snorkel. \nWe had dinner our last night at the Eating House  at Kapolei...Excellent food and service not cheap but worth every penny!\nI hope that all future guests enjoy the Condo as much as we did.

It's a bit out of the heart of the action on Oahu, but we wanted to be away from the crowds, so this worked out great for us. The area does not have much (any) night life, and there is a dearth of good restaurants, so if this is what you are looking for keep this in mind. This might bother some folks but was not an issue for us. Unit was well appointed with snorkel gear, great WiFi, and the dryer for suits and towels was very much appreciated.

It is a bright and happy space with aqua blue touches bringing the feel of the ocean up to the third floor.  The view - gorgeous, the sound of the waves - lovely, and, since it wasn't our first stay at Ma'ili Cove, we weren't surprised by the sounds of Farrington Hwy.  The plexiglass on the windows in this unit really cut down on the noise.  Excellent addition.  The Wi-Fi connection was great.  We enjoyed coffee on the balcony in the morning, exploring the island or reading poolside during the day, and watching the sunset in the evening while listening to a resident blow a conch shell.  Friendly residents and guests gathered in the courtyard in the evenings to watch the sunset and visit, and some of them bbq'd.  Several bbq's are available.  There were sand chairs, boogie boards, a cooler, beach towels, and snorkeling equipment in the closet alongside a dryer.  The kitchen had everything we needed to feel at home.  There was an air conditioner in the bedroom, but we didn't need to use it.  We left the balcony screen door open overnight.

It is generally quiet except for the occasional firetruck, or sometimes local parties by neighbors. Shutting a window keeps out most noise. It is NYC after all, so it's not rural quiet.

There are restaurants nearby, and a store about 4 blocks away for food items and other needs. It is about 12 minutes to walk to the Ferry or 2-5 minutes by bus. The areas towards the Ferry can appear run down in some spots. Again, this is NYC, filled with a great diversity of people.

We were able to use all of the kitchen facilities, including light cooking and had ample space in the fridge for our things. The wireless internet worked well and was easy to connect to and there was a PC \u0026 TV we could use in the living room with Netflix etc. Staying with Alex is a good value option for a visit to New York, especially with the free Staten Island ferry. It is only a few minutes by bus to Alex's place and the bus schedules are planned to coincide with the ferry arriving at St George's. Whilst Alex's street is nice, the area between it and the ferry terminal is not as nice and we did not always feel completely safe, especially at night, for example we had an altercation with someone aggressively pestering us for money at a bus stop on Bay Street during the morning and several unpleasant characters on the bus at night, who were shouting, swearing and banging on the windows. Obviously this is outside Alex's control and some people may not be as bothered by it as we were, but i think its important for travellers to be aware. Overall we enjoyed our stay which was really good value when compared to staying elsewhere in New York."},{"_id":"105569528","date":{"$date":"2016-10-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9767864","reviewer_id":"37339307","reviewer_name":"Tine","comments":"Staying at Owl's Landing was possibly the best Airbnb-experience anyone could hope for.

On top of this, the beds are comfy, the decor of the house utterly charming, (and there's a supermarket very close by and the ferry really is only in perfect walking distance).

Before I even arrived, I was pleased with his response time whenever I messaged.\r\n\r\nHe was very personable and seems responsive to quest cues.

Other guests arrived like 10 minutes later and were treated to a lovely speech about Staten Island and a mini tour using Goggle Maps.\r\n\r\nHe had coffee and tea available for people.  Alex also made extra coffee in the mornings after I mentioned I drank coffee in the morning too.  \r\n\r\nListing itself I feel is well worth the price charged.  Owl's Landing is a home and has the wonderful quirks that come with being a lived in space.  I got to dig a place that has a stack of comic books available to read in the bathroom and a Batman toy handing on entrance coat-hook.  The public areas of the house designed to be cozy, which was nice when I wanted an afternoon of not being a tourist.\r\n\r\nI stayed for a week and cleanliness was never an issue.  The public areas stayed neat and bathrooms remained stocked.\r\n\r\nI was happy with the location.  My vacation plans had me going to all five boroughs, so I knew my transit times going in and out were going to be long.  As is the nature of New York City, it was connected to everywhere, some places take a longer time than others.  \r\n\r\nIf you are planning the normal Manhattan tourist places, this place is a good bargain.

I was feeling so comfortable there. Alex wasn't there at my second stay but because I already know the rules it was ok. He was so kind to propose his house even he wasn't there.

Nous etions dans le Vermont les jours avant et c’etais notre premiere fois que nous allions visiter New York, à bord de notre voiture. Si c’est votre cas et que vous allez chez Alex, prevoyez 15$ pour traverser le Goathals Bridge, sinon c’est simple, facile d’accès avec stationnement gratuis sans soucis pour votre vehicule de ce quartier.\n\nNous avons été acceuillis par Alex chaleureusement, il a bien prit le temps de nous faire visiter ses installations et en plus ils nous a donner beaucoup de conseils avec trucs et astuces pour bien profiter de notre séjour! Des fruits, quelques bières et autres commodités etaient à notre disposition. \n\nLe plus gros avantage, est l’emplacement de sa maison. Vous n’êtes qu’à 15 minutes à pieds du Staten Island Ferry!!! Ce traversier est gratuit et de loin le meilleur pour voir de prêt la statue de la liberty, le Skyline de New York et Brooklyn avec son pont! Le ferry fonctionne 24/24! Vous arriverez directement à Manathann dans le district financier pour voir le Pont de Brooklyn, le Chargin Bull et le memorial du World Trade Center.\n\nEnsuite, Alex nous a expliqué le fonctionnement de la carte pour utiliser le Metro. C’est le meilleur moyen pour profitez pleinement de votre voyage.\n\nPour son acceuil, l’amplacement, le cachet de la maison et surtout le prix... il est difficile de voyager avec autant d’avantage à petit prix! N’hesitez pas! \n\n\nEnglish—\n\nWe reserve the room Loft from Monday 6th August to Wednesday 8th August. We were in Vermont the days before and it was our first time visiting New York (road trip) aboard our car. If that's your case and you're going to Alex's house, plan $ 15 to cross the Goathals Bridge, otherwise it's simple, easy to get to with no worries parking for your car in this area.\n\nWe were greeted by Alex warmly, he took the time to make us visit his facilities and in addition he gave us many tips to enjoy our stay! Fruit, a few beers and other amenities were available.\n\nThe biggest advantage is the location of his house. You are only 15 minutes walk from the Staten Island Ferry !!! This ferry is free and by far the best to see near the Statue of Liberty, the New York Skyline and Brooklyn with the bridge! The ferry runs 24/24! You will arrive directly at Manathann in the financial district to see the Brooklyn Bridge, the Chargin Bull and the World Trade Center memorial.\nThen Alex explained the operation of the map to use the Metro. This is the best way to fully enjoy your trip.\n\nFor its acceuil, the extension, the stamp of the house and especially the price ... it is difficult to travel with so much advantage at low cost!

Guy was very hospitable in pointing out things we might need during our stay, providing maps and info, etc., and was flexible with our check-in and checkout times. He was very accessible in case we needed to ask him anything, as he lives right upstairs. The apartment was very spacious and just as represented in the pictures. We cooked in a few times and had everything we needed in the kitchen. We especially loved the neighborhood, which is very calm, quiet, and family-friendly; there is a primary school just across the street. It was a tiny bit further than we expected to get to the heart of downtown, but we felt like it was worth it for how great the place was; it was sort of a nice retreat from the busy city center Overall, it was a great experience and I would definitely recommend staying here to anyone interested in visiting the city!"},{"_id":"109132141","date":{"$date":"2016-10-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9794124","reviewer_id":"9540350","reviewer_name":"Neshat","comments":"We enjoyed our stay in this flat and would highly recommend it to other travelers."},{"_id":"110977562","date":{"$date":"2016-10-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9794124","reviewer_id":"72799247","reviewer_name":"Chris","comments":"He was very nice.

Staying at leqube was by far one of the best and most memorable experiences we've had using Airbnb and through traveling in general.\n\nThe first thing that captivated us and the reason we chose to stay here was their design, style, and layout of the property. Sophisticated yet minimal, clean, simple, modern,cool and easy. \n\nThe people behind leqube really went out their way to think of what a guest could need during their stay, everything was excellent and better than described in the listing.\n\nThe whole check in and check out experience was fast, seamless and simple and didn't require any intersection with the host, however they are available to help at a moments notice if you might need. The room comes with everything listed, and yes the Apple TV and Netflix combo are a cool and modern feature to have. Almost forgot to mention they have a rooftop lounge with ping pong and hot tub.\n\nApart from the overall amazing trip we had in Montreal, one of the reasons that made it so magical and made this particular city so memorable in our minds was having a place like leqube to call our home away from home for the weekend.\n\nCounting down the days to our next trip to Montreal and our next stay at leqube."},{"_id":"80640999","date":{"$date":"2016-06-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9807529","reviewer_id":"33783947","reviewer_name":"Anick","comments":"Un endroit exceptionnel !

Clean, quality bed lines and towels, apartment is simple but has all the basic appliances. Raphael’s service (he works with Paola) was outstanding, very responsive, super kind person. Electric shower, not ideal but ok. High floor with no safety nets on the windows, so not recommended for small children.

The location is great in a Leblon which is very safe and near the metro which takes you into central RJ, walking distance to the beaches of Leblon \u0026 Ipanema.  The block is getting on a bit but has 24-hour security/porter and you will need to give a copy of photo ID to them to access the block.\n\nThe apartment could do with updating but is comfortable and has a/c in every room. The washing machine/cooker works well and there are plenty of pots/pans/crockery etc. The things that dragged down my score overall is the lack of hot water anywhere but the showers. There is no kettle in the kitchen so making tea or/and boiling water to wash dishes needs to be done in a pan. The bedroom window needs repairing because it doesn't close and swings in the win, making noise. The fridge had a leak and the top shelf was covered in water each day. Though there is cable tv you will only get a handful of Brazilian channels (go out I guess). Finally check out is at 10 am which is just too early and though you can leave bags with the porters it would be better if checkout was 12."},{"_id":"329699188","date":{"$date":"2018-09-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9853331","reviewer_id":"53851702","reviewer_name":"Arturas","comments":"Very good location.

The internet didn't work all that well and we were told we could access Netflix, which we couldn't get running. All in all, if you are looking for a fairly inexpensive place to stay in a great neighborhood, this apartment is fine. In the end it was very bare bones and only provides a place to sleep."},{"_id":"66877495","date":{"$date":"2016-03-25T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9867316","reviewer_id":"25193260","reviewer_name":"Mau","comments":"Kate was really helpful when we arrived.

I really felt like I had the New York City experience staying in their home.  One last note: Their bedroom looks out on a courtyard, which allows tree-filtered light to flow into the apartment.

I expected it to be small with it being NYC, but most coat closets are more spacious than this bathroom. We ended up using the kitchen sink more than the bathroom sink. Luckily there were lots of mirrors so we could get ready outside of the bathroom. Other than that, it was very clean and quiet, and a short walk to the subway. The bed and pillows were very comfy, and Miguel was absolutely awesome with his communication. He accommodated a late check out that allowed us to explore more of the city before we left.

Plenty of restaurants and stores nearby, as well as reasonably (for NYC) priced parking garages.\n\nThe apartment itself is a typical NYC \"1-bed\" - tight, but functional. As two plus a baby we had enough space, but not much left over. The bathroom is particularly tight for people not used to NYC style living.\n\nMiguel and his wife were exceptionally helpful and responsive both in advance and during our stay, including undertaking research re parking coupons.\n\nThe apartment is on a busy traffic (not fast traffic, but congested) street making access/egress by car slow, however there is space outside to stop and unload (at risk of a ticket, but we were quick and no problems)."},{"_id":"147725418","date":{"$date":"2017-04-28T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9867316","reviewer_id":"97300575","reviewer_name":"Ilya","comments":"Огромное спасибо Мигелю и особенно его жене Кате за радушный прием и прекрасную квартирку в отличном месте!!!

It was walking distance to Central Park, Madison av, Park av, Bloomingdales and even Rockefeller if you felt like it (probably 45 mins or so). Subway and groceries at Whole Foods was convenient. \n\nThe apartment is small but not knowing what to compare to in New York I assume it is fairly standard. It was safe and quiet even with construction out front. We had a 10month old with us and the floor boards were creaky which made it a little difficult to do anything without waking her up while asleep as in such close confines. Bench space and cupboard space in the kitchen were limited also but manageable. \n\nThe hosts were easy to contact and let us leave our bags on check our day.

They answered quickly and were very attentive. I didn't get a chance to meet Miguel, but Kate was very nice, and even helped me get my suitcase upstairs. (Thank you!). Several reviews here are noting this apartment's proximity to Central Park, which ismisleading. If that is important to you, look at a map, you'll see it's not close to the Park. It was very clean and is situated in the back of the building, so was very quiet. It is closer to 2nd Ave. than 1st. Nearest Subway station is at 59th \u0026 3rd. Cross-town bus @ 57th. There's a Whole Foods on 57th btn. 2nd \u0026 3rd, and a Starbucks on 3rd btn. 60th \u0026 61st. I have only 2 suggestions for the lovely hosts. #1: It would be nice if the kitchenette came equipped with a roll of paper towels. #2: I lived in NYC on and off for 20 years, so I know \"the lay of the land, as it were. But if you do NOT, things can be a little confusing. It would be GREAT, if there was, for example, a binder with some orientation details....like where the nearest subway stops are, grocery stores, etc. The hosts do provide some maps and brochures, but those are somewhat haphazard. Something more detailed would, I think, be appreciated by anyone who really is new to NYC. Other than those 2 SMALL details, the stay was great!

The place is basic, clean, and well located for the East River, Central Park, MOMA etc. The apartment is up two short flights of stairs. It's a quiet apartment block and I felt safe.  There are lots of good bars and restaurants nearby (I particularly liked the Upper East Cafe on 3rd near E.62nd). The place is pretty reasonable value for money in terms of space, compared with a budget hotel. There were some kitchen basics missing  but Miguel supplied some of them the following day (though it was a creative challenge to eat breakfast yoghurt with no spoon!). There's a homey leather sofa in the living space, and a large screen TV with Netflix etc. Be prepared: the shower room is tiny and pretty shabby but it is clean, and the water pressure is good.  I think this would be a good crash pad for a weekend  in NYC, when you are eating out etc. I needed to use the place also to work - and it didn't really work out for me as the work space wasn't very well thought-through or adequate. With hindsight I should have asked for clarification, as this was important for me. If you are going in Summer, it would be worth asking Miguel for a fan for the bedroom, as the air con unit serves the living space and doesn't make much of an impact on the temperature in the bedroom."},{"_id":"316607732","date":{"$date":"2018-08-31T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9867316","reviewer_id":"211034007","reviewer_name":"Nathan","comments":"Great stay!"},{"_id":"317098991","date":{"$date":"2018-09-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9867316","reviewer_id":"19910535","reviewer_name":"Lindzee","comments":"Great stay!

We enjoyed getting a morning crepe or croissant from Paris Crepe right down at the end of the block once or twice! It's also a cheap cab ride away for rue saint Laurent if your looking to take part in Montréal's vibrant night life. My friend and I both like to walk so we did walked to both Old Montréal and Mount Royal on two separate days. However, if you're less keen on walking a couple miles for some good and fun exercise and get to know the city a bit, the metro station is just a block or two away.

The apartment was immaculate. The building is brand new. It was a spacious studio that was very comfortable for my fiancé and I. It came stocked with most of the normal living amenities from laundry detergent and trash bags to paper towels and olive oil. There was even a little coffee maker that I used every morning. Although there is an outstanding coffee spot Cafe Myriade just a couple blocks over that I highly recommend. Ben was great, always responsive and very out of the picture. It felt very much like a hotel experience (which is what we were looking for) at a fraction of the price.\n\nThe area felt extremely safe even late at night. It is at the intersection of a street of bars/pubs/clubs and the most high foot traffic shopping street in the city. It is central to everything. The 2 main subway lines are just a few blocks away. This is the ideal location for your first time in Montreal. Walking distance from Mount Royal.\n\n"},{"_id":"78586959","date":{"$date":"2016-06-07T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9907103","reviewer_id":"17482162","reviewer_name":"Will \u0026 Genevieve","comments":"Benjamin's apartment was the perfect location in relation to the center of downtown Montreal.

Anytime we had a small question, we could contact her!   We definitely recommend both this studio as these wonderful hosts!

It could not be in a more convenient for those wishing to visit Barcelona.  It is close to public transport (\u003c5 min walk to the Aerobus stop and Metro stations) yet set away on a relatively quiet street so at night I did not experience any outside noise.  I found the apartment to be perfectly situated between all the parts of town I hoped to visit during my trip, equally close to El Born, the Eixample, and of course it is right in El Gotic, a few minutes to the Rambla.\r\n\r\nOther than the fantastic location, the flat was very well appointed, with a comfortable couch, comfortable bed, fully equipped kitchen, and (compared to what I have experience in similarly-sized European flats) an uncramped bathroom/shower.  \r\n\r\nThe apartment was very clean when I arrived, and Ewa was very welcoming and friendly.

About 30min after she left we accidentally blew out the power, and she was back in 5 min to turn it back on.\n\nThe one negative part for us -- there is very loud construction RIGHT across the street that began every day at 8am, even on weekends. It was pretty difficult not to be woken up by the noise. Also, the A/C didn't seem to work very well for us, but in May that wasn't a huge deal.

The atmosphere of it made it very cosy and lovely. \r\nIt was exactly as it is in the photographs, very clean, tidy and perfectly prepared for the visitors and it immediately created a very nice impression of the apartment. All of the dishes were clean, the shower was also perfectly clean, there were no dirty towels or sheets. The apartment had all of its listings. \r\nAlthough Ewa couldn't welcome us herself but we were kindly welcomed by her job mate as soon as we came. We were told everything that we needed to know as well as got a prepared book with many suggested restaurants and in general places to visit in Barcelona. And since our flight back was in the evening it was really lovely that we were allowed to stay longer in the apartment and check out later.\r\nThe location of the apartment is perfect. It is nearby to the Plaça de Catalunya, a few minutes walk to La Rambla and about as much to the Passeig de Gràcia, the shopping street. The beach is around 2km from the apartment however it is easy and pleasant to walk since the surroundings are very lovely and the centre of the city is always full of people. \r\nUnfortunately, we didn't get a chance to meet the owners but I have an impression that they are very lovely, organised and look at everything seriously. Ewa made sure that we were comfortable and inquired if we were OK. I am sure that the hosts would help with anything you need.\r\nStaying in Pau and Ewa's apartment made the visit to Barcelona even more better. We couldn't have imagined a better place.

It is only steps from Plaça de Catalunya with access to transportation anywhere in the city which made it easy to stop by the apartment in the middle of the day as well (Website hidden by Airbnb) \n     The apartment itself was beautiful and comfortable. My daughter and I were traveling together.   The pull out sofa was different from the standard American kind that requires the mattress to fold three times and instead was a far more comfortable full thickness cushion. Then it was very easy to turn it back into a sofa for the day. Everything we needed was provided. \r\n   Ewa communicated very clearly in advance and in person so that all arrangements proceeded with perfect smoothness. Also they provided a wonderful booklet explaining information about the apartment and issues such as how to travel to the apartment from various forms of transportation, suggestions for restaurants in the neighborhood and things to see.

Although an intimate space, it was comfortable for our group of three. It is a third floor walk up, so be ready for a workout and a good sense of humor to bring your bags up and down.\n\nLocation: Optimal for its proximity to the Catalunya metro station, buses, and taxis at all hours. It's also right next to La Rambla - an always bustling tourist district.\n\nHosts: Top, great, singing their praises. Ewa prepared the apartment and met us early since we had an afternoon FCB game to attend, despite another guest having checked out that same morning. But what really makes these hosts stand out is that on our first night (a Saturday), we got locked out of the apartment. We contacted the hosts via the numbers they provided and Ewa was there in 20 minutes - on a Saturday night after 22:00! She got us in quickly and took control of and calmed a potentially stressful situation - she couldn't have handled it better. We're very grateful for her impressive hospitality and quick problem-solving in an unexpected situation.

Квартира удобно расположена на главной пешеходной улице, до центра можно дойти пешком всего за 10 минут.

It was well equipped throughout, with all the little touches you could need during your stay, including extra towels.  The apartment was clean and toiletries were abundant.  You can tell they put a lot of thought into setting up this apartment.   We didn't meet Daniel, but his mother met us there.  She was very nice and showed us all the features around the apartment.  The furniture was newer and comfortable.  It was nice to have covered secured parking, but it was a little tricky getting in and out since it is on a very busy street and it is a narrow steep drive to come up from the underground parking.  \n\nReally the only negative of this apartment is the street it is on.  Due to the traffic light about 100 meters away, the traffic was VERY heavy from about 07:00 to 09:00 and then again from 16:00 to 19:00 with a lot of honking......   And then at about 23:00 until 03:00 (or 04:30 on weekends) the \"ladies of the night\" came out and hung out at the cafe across the street, talking and laughing loudly while drumming up business.  It made it difficult to sleep due to the noise."},{"_id":"128259177","date":{"$date":"2017-01-23T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9969335","reviewer_id":"60069575","reviewer_name":"Felipe","comments":"O apartamento conseguiu superar as expectativas.

Andante (metro) and train tickets available to recharge during your stay very useful.Great having Free WiFi, internet TV with US, ES,FR and UK BBC world channels as well as PT channels.\n\nDidn't meet Daniel and Maria, but Daniels dad met me and gave me brief tour of flat. Daniel rang to make sure all ok and and advise re water boiler.\n\nTwo lifts to this 2nd floor flat. Busy road, but only one way road and traffic worst in evening rush hour. Some noise from traffic, if you have windows open. Did find nice to open windows when very hot. Blinds help keep rooms cool.\n\nMarques metro 2 mins walk and this gives easy access to centre, just 5 stops euro 1.20 to Sao Bento near cathedral, main square and railway. Marques also has good bus connections including Serralves art gallery and Foz on coast.\n\nThere are several cafes around Marques square and I enjoyed Fumeiro for tasty fresh fruit juices inc strawberry, peach and cakes.  Celeste bakery for breakfast bread, toast and cakes and evening pizzas (also take away).\n\nPingo Doce supermarket 5 mins walk from appartment, butchers and fruit shop 1 min. The other end of Rua St Catarina is main shopping street, approx 30 mins walk downhill from flat.\n\nI really enjoyed the flat and it's area and felt very much like a local, but able to do the tourist sites easily."},{"_id":"167973189","date":{"$date":"2017-07-08T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9969335","reviewer_id":"26956444","reviewer_name":"Silvia","comments":"Casa muy agradable, igual que en las fotos.

Vous êtes à deux minutes de la station Marques, et à deux stations de Trindade qui vous permettra de prendre n'importe quelle ligne, et donc de vous rendre à peu près partout dans la ville.\nL'appartement n'est pas dans la partie la plus touristique de la ville, et vous pouvez donc profiter sur place des tarifs locaux, et donc d'un coût de la vie plutôt intéressant dans le cadre de votre visite touristique. Un pingo doce (petit magasin pour faire vos courses) se trouve à 5 minutes.\nEn revanche, l'appartement donne sur une rue à fort passage, et un bar/boite de nuit se trouve à quelques mètres. Sachez que les lois sur le bruit ne sont clairement pas les mêmes qu'en France, et qu'il pourra donc vous arriver de reconnaître depuis votre lit la musique qui passe, lorsque par exemple des clients oublient de fermer les portes de l'établissement. Malgré le fait que l'appartement ait été refait à neuf, le bâtiment en lui même n'est pas bien isolé pour le bruit extérieur, et cela peut parfois se faire sentir.\nJe dirais que le problème de la musique s'est fait particulièrement ressentir lors d'une nuit. Si vous recherchez un silence absolu, passez votre chemin, mais un bon emplacement en ville et le calme plat se trouvent difficilement en un même lieu, donc rien de rédhibitoire à ce niveau là, je tenais juste à l'écrire pour qu'il n'y ait pas de mauvaise surprise.\n\nConcernant l'appartement en lui même, il a vraiment été bien refait. La cuisine est plutôt bien équipée, il ne manque qu'un lave vaisselle (de par la présence d'une machine à laver) et un four. On notera par contre que la quantité de vaisselle pourrait être limitée si vous venez à 4.  Le salon est agréable, et la télé connectée vous permettra de vous occuper sur netflix ou youtube en rentrant de vos promenades le soir. La salle de bain avec sa baignoire était parfaite. Pour terminer, concernant la chambre, la literie était de bonne qualité même si le lit avait tendance à un peu grincer.\n\nL'appartement était très propre à notre arrivée, et la semaine que nous avons passé sur place a vraiment été agréable. Daniel a su être disponible lorsque nous avions besoin de lui, même très tôt le matin lorsque nous sommes reparti.\n\nPour conclure, et suite à ma mésaventure, je me permettrais de vous donner le conseil suivant : au moment de rendre l'appartement, et donc de laisser les clés à l'intérieur pour ensuite claquer la porte, vérifiez au préalable que la porte du hall n'a pas été fermée à double tour. Cela vous évitera de devoir réveiller un voisin à 4h du matin pendant que le taxi vous attend."},{"_id":"192891930","date":{"$date":"2017-09-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9969335","reviewer_id":"12586412","reviewer_name":"Cristina","comments":"O apartamento é ótimo.

The apartment was spacious and had everything we’d need for our stay. Couch was large and comfortable, the bed was comfortable. There was tv with many channels and wifi worked great. The washing machine was good to have but European washers are hard to understand so I’d ask Daniel or Maria how to use it before you use it! There’s a decent size terrace in the bedroom where you can hang your washed clothes. On the weekends it can get noisy outside as it’s so close to downtown but you quickly get over it. We did run out of toilet paper being there for 8 days, and we had to buy our own replacement, which is fair enough just a little inconvenient but overall a great experience it had everything we needed, would not hesitate to stay in their place again :)"},{"_id":"334819644","date":{"$date":"2018-10-10T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9969335","reviewer_id":"150638155","reviewer_name":"Beatriz","comments":"A estadia foi muito agradável.

Sie hat uns tolle Tipps zum Einkaufen, Essen gehen und praktische Infos gegeben. Außerdem war sie immer gut erreichbar und hat uns auch kurzfristig weitergeholfen, bspw. mit Strandtüchern. Sie ist wirklich eine perfekte Gastgeberin! Wir haben uns auch dank ihr sehr wohl gefühlt. Die Wohnung ist außerdem super gemütlich und für 2 Personen perfekt von der Größe her! Wir haben 8 Nächte in Ana's Wohnung verbracht und wären gerne länger geblieben. Die Lage ist wirklich unschlagbar. Man ist eher im \"Künstlerviertel\" als auf der Touristenmeile und trotzdem ist alles fußläufig erreichbar. Schön ist auch, dass die Wohnung sich in einer Fußgängerzone befindet und gleich vor der Tür schöne Cafés sind. Das einzige kleine Manko ist, dass man Nachts häufig den Lärm der feiernden Meute hört. Schlafen mit offenem Fenster ist also eher schwierig und bei uns war es sehr heiß in Porto.

There are great amenities you can use like a nice gym (gym's in Rio are expensive so it is very worth it), saunas, a pool, pool table/ping pong tables, and onsite laundry at a reasonable price. The location is nice, as it is close to the beach but not too far of a drive from Centro. Cheap ubers get you around all of Rio quickly. Maybe a 7 minute walk to the beach. Restaurant downstairs is pretty good as well! On my next trip to Rio I will definitely see if this place is available."},{"_id":"212550441","date":{"$date":"2017-11-18T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9987200","reviewer_id":"97410201","reviewer_name":"Ole","comments":"Sandra was the perfect host.

The kitchen was FULLY stocked with everything we need to cook so it made life easier and Foodland supermarket (a great market with AWESOME poke) was a 1 minute drive away.  Walking into the town / Front street couldn't be easier and Baby beach was a very short drive away.  Since the unit has a code for entry, not having keys to deal with was a great benefit.

Modern chic furnishings, the bathrooms and kitchen are outdated, but this didn't bother me. The upstairs kids area was awesome. Loved the games, kids books, and toys, and the kids loved having their own space to hang out. Comfortable bed, and great dining area. There was a closet with outdoor things: chairs, boogie boards, sand toys. I had a question and the Coconut Condos team was great at getting back to me ASAP and taking care of it. My only complaint is that the condo could have been cleaner, the floors left our socks dirty, and there were dirty plates in the cupboards.\n\nThe Resort\nPuamana is a beautifully maintained place, with amazing plantings and foliage everywhere, it feels very lush. We were there with 2 young children and I did feel a retirement community vibe. It is not all short term rentals, some people live there more permanently. There are a lot of rules for the resort and a lot about keeping \"quiet enjoyment\" and the best pool, the oceanfront pool, is reserved for \"quiet enjoyment\" and though it doesn't specifically say \"no kids\" we were given the stink eye by all the adults sunbathing when we tried to take our kids there. The other two pools, designated as the kids pools, are just basic and not oceanfront. There are ocean views from everywhere but the actual beach is rocky/sandy and narrow and didn't look good for swimming or sunbathing. I would highly recommend this place to couples traveling without kids."},{"_id":"230037614","date":{"$date":"2018-01-26T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9993190","reviewer_id":"5985353","reviewer_name":"Andrew","comments":"We had a great stay. They make it very easy for families: the beach kit has everything you could ask for and more (chairs, umbrellas, boogie boards, beach toys, even a wagon), the kids play area has books and puzzles, they provide a pack n’ play with a fresh crib sheet, and there’s a washer and dryer. There were also many families at the resort during our stay. There’s a small park with a climber, and 3 pools, though no real shallow area for small kids which limited swimming at the resort. \n\nSome spaces in the condo are a little dated but we had no complaints. You don’t have an ocean view from the condo but you’re very close to the ocean. The beach in front of the resort was washed out at this time of year, but baby beach is just a 10 minute drive away and Puamana beach is walkable from the condo. \n\nThe condo is a short drive to downtown Lahaina, which is a wonderful town with great restaurants and a harbor from which many tours and activities depart. The location is central and very convenient to other parts of the island. We had a wonderful vacation and would stay here again."},{"_id":"267808615","date":{"$date":"2018-05-22T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9993190","reviewer_id":"265335","reviewer_name":"Roberta","comments":"Puamana is a fantastic location, close to town of Lahaina yet very private and quiet.
