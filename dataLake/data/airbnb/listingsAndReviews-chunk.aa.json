Outside the flat there was a slight smell of the river/ sewage, but in all honesty it did not come into the flat, and once you go down the road it doesn't carry on.

Wenn es etwas zu beanstanden gab, wird das sofort problemlos erledigt. Das Apartment ist charmant, die Möbel schon etwas mitgenommen, aber das passt insgesamt ins Bild von Porto und macht den Reiz aus. Die Lage ist super, genau am Duoro. Es gibt Strassenmusik bis in den späten Abend und auch morgens geht's früh los mit fröhlichen Lärm von der Flusspromenade. Nichts also für Leute, die es ruhig brauchen! Die Lage ist wirklich exklusiv und tröstet über den recht teuren Mietpreis. Im Umfeld gibt es typische Touri-Fallen, wo alles doppelt kostet, aber gleichzeitig findet man auch sehr nette kleine Bars, in der man chillig und günstig frühstücken oder generell lecker essen kann. Die Stadt ist klein genug, um sich schnell zurechtzufinden und groß genug, um immer wieder neues zu entdecken. Wir waren zu dritt (50, 25, 20 Jahre) und haben die Zeit wirklich genossen.

Not that this would be particularly unreasonable but it made us feel like we were walking on egg shells in and around the house. \n\nThe hosts were aware that we were a group of six yet one of the beds was not prepared and we ran out of toilet paper well before we were due to check out despite only being there 2 nights. It really wasn't the end of the world but the shower head does not have a wall fitting meaning you had to hold it yourself if you wanted to stand underneath it."}]}

This definitely isn't the Ritz, and if you're looking for a luxury get-away, you're barking up the wrong tree. However, if you're like we were: first time visitors on a budget with humble taste, then this place is perfect. The location is a tiny bit removed from the touristy Beachwalk shopping area, but not so far as to preclude you from limbering up for a spirited walk over there. And by the marina, you're actually quite close to the Ala Moana mall. So, the location is good. The place itself is a modest studio setup, but perfectly adequate with a good sized bed for a couple, enough space for your luggage, and a kitchenette and bathroom that though tight, is perfectly fine. There's also cable and internet if you're looking for homey creature comforts. It was also fantastic to have a free parking space included, an air conditioning wall unit, and the panoramic window view was pretty cool, though you only really get a peak of the beach. Also, David was very good about staying in contact with us the day we arrived to get acclimated, and we did not have further occasion to require his services the rest of our stay, so our contact was minimal, but satisfactory ... no problem there. The minor quibbles we had were pretty thin walls, so we would often hear the murmur of the neighbors' TVs. Also, there seemed to be two elevators working the entire building, so they could take quite a while to pop up. Again though, if you're like us, your #1 priorities are spend a minimal amount of time in your room, get out to experience Hawaii, come back to a sanitary place to sleep at night, all while staying within a reasonable budget. This place fit the bill, and we would recommend it to anyone with the same priorities."},{"_id":"8363944","date":{"$date":"2013-10-28T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1001265","reviewer_id":"7096845","reviewer_name":"Jean","comments":"Fantastic location!

It's definitely not luxurious but has the basics and is in a great location. It fits 2 people but more would be cramped. \nYou can hit the beach in as little as 5 mns walking or get to central Waikiki beach in 15-20 mns walking.  It's also easy to catch a bus to visit something outside Waikiki. There is a convenience store nearby, as well as several breakfast and restaurant options. The apartment has a small kitchen with cooking utensils but we ended up mostly eating dinners out. \nDavid was courteous and likely very knowledgeable about the area but we didn't ask him for suggestions, we ended up just using our guide book. \nOverall if you want to experience Waikiki without spending a fortune or being pampered, this is a great option.

The condo is in a great location if you want to be in or near Waikiki and Ala Moana. It's a small studio, and not luxurious, but great if you want a functional, reasonably comfortable and very affordable base for exploring Oahu. The parking space is wonderful if you rent a car, as otherwise you're looking at an additional $15-$20 a day. The building is right on Ala Moana Blvd so it's noisy if you keep the windows open, but that's also true of many high-price Waikiki hotel rooms. Air conditioning is a bit noisy; I slept with earplugs but my boyfriend didn't need them (I'm a light sleeper and use them at home). The condo has a full size fridge, small cooktop, microwave, coffee maker, coffee press, beach chairs, some knackered beach mats, towels, pots, plates, etc.. Wifi is a plus. The bathroom appears quite recently updated, and though small is nice - great shower. \r\n\r\nCons: There's no lanai and the view is very partial, but to us those were small things. Elevators were sometimes very slow and occasionally out of commission, which was a hassle and a bit concerning.\r\n\r\nWe never actually met David. All was handled by text and email. He instructed us to get someone to let us in to the building, which seemed a bit dodgy, but in the end it was no problem, and he said to call if there was any issue. Condo door was unlocked and keys were on the table.\r\n\r\nI would consider staying here again if I plan to stay in the Waikiki vicinity. \r\n\r\n"},{"_id":"11063672","date":{"$date":"2014-03-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1001265","reviewer_id":"12932701","reviewer_name":"Tami","comments":"If you are looking for a home base with the basics to lay your head at night and have breakfast in and then head out for the day this fits the bill.

I travel to Honolulu 4 times a year and always stay in a hotel, but my cousin recommended I try Airbnb as a less expensive alternative.

The elevator service for the 40 story/140 unit building  is an ongoing problem, with only one ten-person lift  operating “in slow mode for  safety” or not at all if winds are high.

The mall is just down the street or you could walk there, free parking at the mall if you do drive. Down the street on Kalakaua is Luxury Row. The world’s top fashion houses—Tiffany \u0026 Co., Coach, Yves Saint Laurent, Chanel, Gucci, Tod’s, Bottega Veneta and Hugo Boss it was fun to go in the shops. Having a free parking space is a bonus. The view of the marina and ocean was beautiful. I could see boats headed out to sea and parasailers. Laundry located on the 5th floor along with the ice machine if you're headed out for the day a small cooler was provided. Vending machines are on the 2nd floor or you can walk to the ABC store at the corner. Bed was soft and comfortable. Air-conditioner works perfectly or you can open the window for an ocean breeze. Great pressure in the shower and plenty of towels. If you want to eat in there is a microwave, stove and fridge.

David responded usually within two hours.  We were disappointed with the rental but David worked with us to adjust the rental fees.\n\nThe biggest issue we saw was that the condo was dirty.  With a cleaning fee of $100 and the nice pictures on the Airbnb website, we expected a mostly dust free and clean rental.  We talked with David about the dirty items (there were many) and a couple missing items.  He was apologetic and did his best to help salvage our stay. \n\nWe ended up leaving before the end of the rental agreement and David worked with us on that.

One day there was no water in the building due to maintenance. The hosts warned me about this, there was nothing they could do and I was prepared. Only issue is that after the water came back, because of the older pipes, it was brown for a little while, just have to let the taps run for several minutes. \n\nThe bed isn't the most comfortable for an extended stay (I was there for eight nights), but for short durations it's fine. \n\nThere is a washing machine in the apartment, it works great, I dried my clothes by hanging them on chairs, hooks, etc. \n\nThe WiFi is strong and reliable. \n\nThere is a grocery store and a couple of reasonably priced restaurants on the block, as well as two different banks.

Even though we booked our room through Airbnb, we were welcome to all the amenities the hotel had to offer.  We were pleased from our arrival at the hotel, where the exterior was as pretty as the interior and greeted by Robert whose very pleasant demeanor was refreshing.  Each of the staff at the hotel were very professional and accommodating but Robert stood out from the rest.  I was unfortunate enough to have left my phone at a nearby shop after returning via the hotel shuttle, when notifying the front desk to see if I had left my phone in the back seat, Robert quickly responded with his assistance in searching for the item, then driving us immediately to the last location while he assured us he would be outside waiting so we would not have to walk back. I did in fact find my phone at that location (thanks to a good Samaritan) and Robert refused to take compensation for his kindness.  The only thing I would do differently on our next stay is to spend the extra for the room with the patio, as the view from the hotel is quite nice and the breezes up there were wonderful.  We not only will be back to visit the lovely hotel but will gladly recommend it to all who might be vising the Greenpoint area.

The unit is an easy 5-minute walk from the Trindade Metro Station. There were plenty of bars and restaurants nearby, and two supermarkets within 5-minutes of walking (one was open on Sundays, which saved our lives). Though the apartment is located in a lively area, an extra set of shutters provides an additional layer of sound insulation which was a big plus! \r\nCons: The apartment did not have shampoo/conditioner during our stay. Neighbors could be loud at times. Very little sound insulation on the apartment unit door.\r\nOverall: My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Fabio's apartment building. If we are able to visit Porto again, we would definitely stay in this charming apartment again!

But if you have to use the underground it is close to the flat, so get to the airport or the beach isn´t a problem. The flat is extremely clean, and furnished very modern, so it was a great feeling to stay here.

It is so close that I could go there on foot, and that is why I chose it. However, the location itself appeared to be great: the neighborhood around was magnificent, a very vibrant area, with extremely cheap and nice restaurants, street food vendors, shops etc everywhere. And actually, not touristic at all, you are going to see how local people live around there. Especially Mong Kok, which is just a little bit south, I really enjoyed walking around in the evenings. There are plenty of bus stops around, and the subway is at most 5 minutes away.\n\nThe place was also very nice. It was nice to see how common houses there look like and live there. Do not expect high luxuries or something, it is just a normal house. For me, it was a very nice place and adequately clean. There is also kitchen but I did not use it; there is tons of great and cheap food around, so there was no reason to spend time cooking (but Vicky one cooked and shared)! In general, I did not experience any negative issue regarding the facilities of the house.\n\nVicky provides with a sim card with unlimited internet, so it is even better than just having wifi in the house, as you can have internet in your smartphone or laptop everywhere you go. This helped navigating around the city a lot.\n\nVicky and her flatmate, J., were really nice and friendly. Initially, Vicky gave exact and clear instructions on how to get there. Both gave quite many suggestions on what to do in the city, and I even spent time with them. Both seem very interested in interacting with the guests, as long as they have time, of course. \n\nOverall, I am really enjoyed my stay there. I enjoyed being in that location and walking around. Everything concerning the house was working fine, making my stay in Hong Kong comfortable. Also I am very happy to have met Vicky and J., and enjoyed our interactions. I would certainly recommend."},{"_id":"181577731","date":{"$date":"2017-08-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10084023","reviewer_id":"31316205","reviewer_name":"Ayça","comments":"Vicky was very helpful and provided any assistance I needed.

The apartment is very quiet for the area. Although I never met Yi in person she was always accessible to communicate. The room was very sparse but functional wifi was good.\n\nThe place has 3 bedrooms, a common living room with a table, a Chinese style kitchen and a very tiny showering area with hot water which is typical of Hong Kong apartments. There is a functional  TV. The price  is fantastic, cannot be matched.\n\nNow the not so good. The place is the most dirty place I have ever stayed at in HK, and at one point I lived for many years in HK. Yi mentioned the cleaning fee was for the bedrooms only and also no towel is included, which I believe she listed but I did not notice.  The place is good for backpackers and undergraduates. The entire week I was there 4 to 5 men and women stayed there and I can state the bathroom was never cleaned. The kitchen looks like a tornado hit it, and some of the grime is that thick amber tacky stuff from years of grease buildup. The living room is a thick dusty mess, the sheet covering the couch reeks. I had no idea someone, an airline stewardess who I never saw, had her personal things there and in fact the apartment was her home.  I borrowed a mirror left out on the table, and ate some crackers that I mistakenly thought were left by previous guests and it caused huge problems but I immediately returned the mirror and replaced the crackers.\n\nAll in all a mixed experience. I am sure others saw what I saw, but did not mention the messy aspect in their reviews. I am not being picky, but I wish I had know before I booked what I would actually encounter.\n\n Still it is a good deal, best walked into with your eyes wide open and a high tolerance for filthy common areas."},{"_id":"400087952","date":{"$date":"2019-01-11T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10084023","reviewer_id":"233481626","reviewer_name":"Li","comments":"地理位置方便,房东耐心,人美心善!"},{"_id":"402007119","date":{"$date":"2019-01-17T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10084023","reviewer_id":"38063545","reviewer_name":"Andy","comments":"."},{"_id":"402572546","date":{"$date":"2019-01-19T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10084023","reviewer_id":"234227205","reviewer_name":"Jason","comments":"很棒的一次體驗"},{"_id":"403896707","date":{"$date":"2019-01-22T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10084023","reviewer_id":"6469979","reviewer_name":"William","comments":"this is a cool little place - has a lounge - and kitchen! would definitely go back here for sure!"},{"_id":"406308919","date":{"$date":"2019-01-29T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10084023","reviewer_id":"6259521","reviewer_name":"Rhianwen","comments":"This is a good, affordable place to stay while exploring Hong Kong for a few days, especially if you're going to be out and about a lot.

I let ben know and he didn't reply. I chased 2 days later and he agreed to come and take a look - afterwards the issue was much worse and the entire floor was covered in water, the shower then also wouldn't turn off. Ben told me he would look into a plumber coming and once again failed to get in touch - I chased and said it was uninhabitable like that .. and Ben then demanded that we leave that very day with no compromise with time to find somewhere else, despite us having 4 nights left and visiting from London. \nAwful experience all around."},{"_id":"204383727","date":{"$date":"2017-10-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10091713","reviewer_id":"155042249","reviewer_name":"Sarah","comments":"The host canceled this reservation 7 days before arrival.

On arrival, the apartment was quite grubby and full of host's personal possessions with only 2 drawers left for the two of us over a fortnight. The fridge had half empty jars, food stains were all over the cabinet doors, and the place was dusty.\nWe had a disaster in that we accidentally left the keys in the apartment (that locks behind you!). We were unable to contact Ben for over 2 days as he had left the country without informing us - ending with us out on the street for hours, having to stay in a hostel overnight and eventually paying for a locksmith as we desperately needed our belongings. Ben was not even remotely apologetic once he finally got in contact with us. \nOnce we asked him if it was possible for him to reimburse for the locksmith and other costs, he replied aggressively with snarky and unnecessarily nasty comments about our stay - saying we had left wet towels on the floor when actually we had left one wet towel in the laundry basket that we had used to clean the water from the leaking toilet that was a great inconvenience throughout our stay and has been a complaint from another guest. Also said we raked through his personal belongings which were against his 'rules', when actually we only used a couple of towels from a drawer since he only left us one bath towel for two people for a fortnight. Ben has also attempted to charge us 100AUD regarding a small stain on the bed sheet, which is a completely ridiculous price especially considering the fee that we paid for cleaning.\nFurthermore, we asked where he would like his new keys to be left so he could get back in his apartment - to which eventually he said to 'leave them on the kitchen table'. This obviously doesn't make any sense and he only replied a few hours before our departure so we replied we would leave one of the keys in an envelope in his letterbox under his other mail. Only after we requested reimbursement days after we had left, he replied in a hostile manner that he had to pay for his own locksmith as we didn't leave him his key(?). \nOverall a dreadful experience that we wouldn't like anyone else to go through, as leaving the keys in an apartment when the door locks behind your back could essentially happen to anyone. This could have been handled far more efficiently \u0026 pleasantly if the host had actually been a decent person so BEWARE."},{"_id":"238803427","date":{"$date":"2018-02-27T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10091713","reviewer_id":"13988353","reviewer_name":"Selina","comments":"We travelled with a 4 month old baby.

For once the pictures really don't do it justice.  The hotel rooms get marked down for being dated in reviews on hotel sites, but this apartment certainly isn't.  It's centrally located: it has Darlinghurst's little strip of restaurants just around the corner, and central Sydney equally close in the other direction.  I was here for a week in March and it (unusually) rained every day, so the 60\" UHD Samsung smart TV with Netflix and Stan (Aussie streaming), as well as Apple TV, was particularly welcome, as was the small gym on the roof.  The pool was less useful, but would be great normally.  Desireé is a very friendly host too.  Highly recommended."},{"_id":"139320556","date":{"$date":"2017-03-24T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10108388","reviewer_id":"3774958","reviewer_name":"Ishara","comments":"Desireé’s apartment is the perfect place to explore Sydney city from.

It hosts beautiful city views, a quick 5 minute walk to Museum rail station, and a hop to great restaurants and nightlife. The apartment is tastefully decorated with art and books from adventurous travels; furnished and accessorized with absolutely everything that I could require, plus more. I was impressed at the Desireé's thoughtfulness in accommodating her guests needs. Such things as a kind welcome note. Petite chocolates, mini fresh milk packs in the fridge, expresso machine and every conceivable toiletry item one could need inside a bathroom cabinet. Discreetly rolled up extension cords so you never have to look for one to reach the wall socket to charge your digital devices. The bed was comfortable, where sprigs of fragrant lavender greeted us laid upon freshly rolled up towels. We loved our stay and highly recommend Desireé as a host. She communicated well, was always polite and prompt with messaging all required information upon booking. There's no doubt why Desireé has been voted as a super host.

The residence service at the counter was also good and the blokes were helpful. The apartment is clean and spacious, although it could do with a couple of extra basic necessities particularly in the kitchen. \r\n\r\nHowever, two main things made this experience rather average instead of great.\r\n- I reserved a flat with TWO bedrooms and only got one. I complained and they relocated me to a bigger apartment with two separate beds, but still ONE bedroom.  Upon booking make sure to confirm its two bedrooms you sign up to.\r\n\r\n- Saturday seemed to be national construction day which meant 8am rise and shine. sunday there was activity too although less loud.

Abbiamo avuto una pessima esperienza. Mia moglie, io e i tre bambini non abbiamo potuto fermarci neanche un minuto per le pessime condizioni in cui abbiamo trovato l'appartamento. Non corrisponde alle foto, perchè le stanze da letto sono molto più piccole di quello che appaiono, piene di suppellettili polverose e in disordine. Il sofa bed è praticamente un divano sporco dove abbiamo dovuto chiedere lenzuola e ci è stato dato un solo lenzuolo. Il bagno è una latrina minuscola tanto è vero che non appare nelle foto pubblicate. Non abbiamo potuto dormire neanche una notte perché non c'è neanche un cassetto o un armadio vuoto in cui poter stipare i propri effetti. Abbiamo pagato per tre notti oltre 800 euro, non abbiamo passato neanche venti minuti in quella casa, abbiamo dovuto trovare all'1 di notte un'altra sistemazione a New YorK - per cinque persone, compresi due bambini minori - e Chelsea non ci ha risarcito neanche un euro. Veramente un comportamento deprecabile da parte sua."}]}

Der war auch dringend notwendig, da es in New York im Juli sehr heiß ist. Lane war sehr freundlich und aufmerksam.

During our stay we didn't have much Interaktion with Lane and Annette though,  since we were gone exploring the city most of the time. The room was fine and just like depicted, but, as mentioned in previous comments, quite hot. The subway was only a short walk away, however, if there were constructions or delays, it sometimes took us over an hour to get into Manhatten - so just be aware of that. If you are planning to cook while in New York, I wouldn't necessarily recommend their place as the kitchen was rather poorly equipped and the cupboards above the stove were pretty greasy. Altogether: if you are just staying for a couple of nights and don't expect to be right at the edge of Manhatten, it's a good place to stay at.

They keep their place clean and presentable so be sure to take your shoes off at the door! Their spot is in Jamaica, Queens and about an 8-10 min walk to the F and E trains at the Kew Gardens stop so it's super easy to get to and from the city and JFK. If you love NY pizza as much as I do, there's a spot not far from the trains on Queens Blvd right next to the McDonlads and a cafe as well as other eateries and shops. However, if you'd prefer to cook, they do have a kitchen, which I did not take advantage of. Again, I was out and about pretty much the whole time, but Lane's place is an excellent place if you need a clean bed and shower. Oh, and if I'm not mistaken I saw a Keurig, which I also did not take advantage of, but if you need some caffeine to start your day, then boom!"},{"_id":"218267130","date":{"$date":"2017-12-11T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10140368","reviewer_id":"103900814","reviewer_name":"Javeria","comments":"Very pleasant lady and very clean space"},{"_id":"218579136","date":{"$date":"2017-12-13T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10140368","reviewer_id":"124988427","reviewer_name":"Andreea","comments":"A warm, inviting home.

It's a big house with 10 large bedrooms, and common livingroom and large kitchen, deck (super nice) and bathrooms (3 bathroom area with individual shower (nice one), sink and toilet). I met nice people who gave me good advices to get around Sydney. David, the host, is very responsible and responded on the post to my emails while I was there. Being large, the house is very quiet and no one really bother anyone else. A cleaner shows up everyday, they were two ladies when I was there. They do an amazing job keeping the place spotless, and they are also very sweet. Now, Coggee is an amazing place. The house is up the street from the beach- there is also a large green park next to the beach. It's really nice. I went swimming at the ladies bath (sometype of sea water swimming pool on the beach) the first morning despite being Winter: amazing! I find that the picture showing Coggee beach do not make justice. It is so much more beautiful. I can't wait to go back there. (details: bus are down the street, Sydney downtown is 25min away, the airport is 20 min away (35$ for a cab), Bondi beach is 2 beaches away :p (20min), and peroquees are all around:)"},{"_id":"36828326","date":{"$date":"2015-07-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1016739","reviewer_id":"36481755","reviewer_name":"David","comments":"David introduced himself almost immediately on arrival and made me feel welcome.

Luckily, I have more space. \r\n\r\nThe room is just as the pictures display: huge, clean, and comfy! There's a 2persons bed, a build-in closet, another closet with drawers, a book case, a big desk, and a comfy sofa to relax on. Although the room offers more space than you probably need, you can also just hang out in the cozy living room. But the best place has to be the back yard, which Laura turned in a little green oasis. It's the ideal spot to relax after a long day, enjoy the sun, or have a home dinner. And no need to feel lonely as Lulu - a.k.a. the most adorable cat ever - and his buddies from the block are always around somewhere (especially if you give them some of your ham sandwich or sushi). \r\n\r\nI've stayed at Laura's for several months and I've never felt so at home in another person's house. Laura went above and beyond to make my stay as pleasant as possible. I was new to Montreal (actually I was new to Canada) and didn't know any people other than a few colleagues. Laura embraced me as a friend and made sure I never had to feel alone or get bored, while also giving me all the privacy I wanted. \r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood has everything you need. The house is near  shops, supermarkets, cafe's, restaurants, parks (including the Mont Royal), several busstops, 2 metro stations (Laurier \u0026 Mont Royal; both 10 min walking distance), and there's and there's always some fun - often free - festival around the corner in the summer. Despite all this the street is actually really quiet and is very safe!\r\n\r\n"},{"_id":"79349243","date":{"$date":"2016-06-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1019168","reviewer_id":"50080424","reviewer_name":"Matt","comments":"Laura was a brilliant host.

Lilou ha senza dubbio stile. La casa è posizionta tra i miei due quartieri in assoluto preferiti della città: Plateu e Mile End e bastano pochissimi giorni per sentirsi subito integrati nel quartiere come un vero Montrealese!! Meno di 10 minuti a piedi e si raggiunge la stazione della metropolitana Laurier e in meno di 15 minuti quella di Mont-Royal. Inoltre l'autobus 55 passa a un minuto a piedi da casa e ti porta in Downtown - old port in 20 minuti e in little italy in 15. Il quartiere è pieno di cafè, gallerie d'arte, negozi vintage e bistro dove cenare o fare un brunch! E' davvero un luogo autentico.\nLilou è un host fantastica.. e la sua gatta Milton è molto dolce e simpatica.\nLa casa ha tutto ciò che (Website hidden by Airbnb) cucina è ben fornita e in taverna c'è la lavatrice e l'asciugatrice che si può utilizzare liberamente."},{"_id":"264348567","date":{"$date":"2018-05-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1019168","reviewer_id":"719179","reviewer_name":"Erik","comments":"The location of Lilou's place in the heart of the Plateau couldn't be better: really good restaurants just a block away (try Robin Du Bois!), a superb massage and bodywork business just around the corner (Place Nomade), a few blocks to the supermarket in one direction, a few more blocks to the natural food store in another direction, great ethnic restaurants in every direction, even an excellent hardware store in walking distance, not to mention big public parks (especially Mont Royal), about a 15-minute walk to the Laurier metro stop, Portuguese, Greek and Hassidic communities nearby, trendy bars, vintage bagel shops...etc., etc. A very fun area to be in. To stay in this airbnb, you definitely need to be OK with cats, since the very friendly black cat who lives there considers herself the true owner.

Although I’m not highly familiar with Montreal and its various neighborhoods, this wonderful home is close to everything I wanted/needed. Super hip neighborhood, a beautiful park not too far away and so many lovely shops/cafes, if that’s what you’re into. There was a grocery store across the street and lots of bus stops nearby. The metro was only a 7-10 minute walk away. It’s ground level, so it makes traveling with large luggage bags pretty easy. Milton, the cat, was friendly and gentle. Laura made excellent company as well. About as close to a perfect host you could get; never too overbearing and yet great to make conversation with. The room was bigger than I thought it was going to be! Even though Montreal is hot and humid it was never uncomfortable, the fan provided in the room did the trick for me. There were a couple instances where the door was locked from the inside, but it was never a huge problem. Laura was easy to get in contact with and surprisingly quick to reply, no matter what time of day it was. It didn’t make my stay any less incredible. The price is right and I cannot recommend this place enough!

Všechno bylo poblíž, ať už obchody či restaurace nebo nádherné pláže. Byl to nádherný pobyt a rozhodně doporučuji vyzkoušet jeho domácí chléb :))))"},{"_id":"95233723","date":{"$date":"2016-08-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10240767","reviewer_id":"48955829","reviewer_name":"倜","comments":"房间干净,环境优美,老板待人非常热情,还帮着接送我们,辛苦了｡以后有机会还回来｡"},{"_id":"96704187","date":{"$date":"2016-08-24T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10240767","reviewer_id":"21738318","reviewer_name":"Shandy","comments":"This a great space to stay.

He was very responsive to our communication and helpful in providing direction once our flight landed.  He even provided us with the written directions in Cantonese in case our taxi driver didn’t speak English (which came in very handy!).\r\n\r\nRicky had his cousin meet us at a College which was 10 minutes from the airport.  His cousin was very friendly and helpful – he even arrived with a cart to carry our bags to the apartment.   As there are no vehicles that directly access Ricky’s neighbourhood, there was a lovely 5 minute walk on a beautiful path which weaved through the jungle.  \r\n\r\nUpon arrival at Ricky’s building, it was clear that the place was very clean and well kept.  He provided us with some water bottles, offered us dinner, and his 2 friendly cats entertained us while he checked us in.  He proceeded to show us the rooftop terrace which is a great spot to hang out and enjoy the view of the mountains.  There is also an area to wash and hang dry your laundry up there.\r\n\r\nThe room appeared to be recently renovated.  It was small, but it was very clean and efficiently laid out.  There was good A/C to keep cool as well as a TV with some basic cable for some entertainment.\r\n\r\nOverall, this was a perfect place nearby the airport to spend the night before continuing our travels.  The price was fair, and I would highly recommend staying here. \r\n\r\n"},{"_id":"107696381","date":{"$date":"2016-10-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10240767","reviewer_id":"3682451","reviewer_name":"Luca","comments":"Location is 5 minutes nice walk away from main road, in the middle of the threes and bridges on a very small village.

Even though I had a somewhat late arrival, his cousin Terry met us and had a dolly for our luggage. His place is like this hidden oasis. You take this cool walk through all these fruit trees. It looks like a forest! It's off the beaten path, but that's what adds to it's charm and appeal. When you get to his place, it's quiet and you feel like you're away from the hustle and bustle, but you're really not. \n\nThe room that we stayed in had a separate entrance from the house, so it was like we had our own apartment,  minus the kitchen. My boyfriend and I each had a backpack and a carry on suitcase. The room was a bit tight for us and our stuff, but it was manageable. It was clean, cozy and comfortable. It had all the amenities you would need...towels, soap, shampoo, comfy and clean bed, heat or AC (which we didn't use), safe place, and privacy. The room was just what we needed. We had our own bed and restroom. It was clean and it was close to the airport. Plus, there's wifi! Since I arrived kind of late, I texted Ricky about the wifi and he got back to me right away! \n\nThen, on our departure day, Terry had arranged a taxi for us and saw us off. It was like VIP service without the VIP price.  Overall, you can't go wrong by booking with Ricky and Terry. These guys know what they're doing. Their place is just what you need...if it's for one night or more...you'll get great hosts with a great place to stay. Don't wait...just book with them!

The natural beauty of the area is wonderful."},{"_id":"138836700","date":{"$date":"2017-03-21T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10266175","reviewer_id":"66393250","reviewer_name":"Brandon","comments":"The place was nice but they're far too many rules at the complex"},{"_id":"140264291","date":{"$date":"2017-03-28T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10266175","reviewer_id":"70567692","reviewer_name":"Amber","comments":"Great place!"},{"_id":"151659289","date":{"$date":"2017-05-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10266175","reviewer_id":"20185810","reviewer_name":"Ben","comments":"Ray's place in Makaha is perfect for travelers who want to experience the best that Hawaii has to offer.

It is everything their ad says and more. It really is about as far removed from the Honolulu tourist bustle as one can get. This is a huge bonus to experience Hawaii and a place to live and enjoy the people and untouched beaches along the Waianae Coast.  The Waianae Harbor is just down the road and is where many people from the Waikiki hotels get bused an hour to board the boats to go out for turtle and dolphin cruises.  But, you will be right there! The condo tower community is much more resort like than other condos (minus a restaurant on property), but with the many local restaurants nearby you will never get bored with the eating out options. The condo in modern with all the essential elements. The bathroom is large, the bed is comfy. This is one of the rare units with a screen front door so you can open it up to enjoy a cross breeze if desired and not get attacked by mosquitoes. The view is fantastic. Laundry is just down the hall. I highly recommend Ray and Lise's place!\n\nA word about Handicap Access: If you are handicap and need to avoid stairs, be sure to bring your handicap placard from your car so they give you a special pass to park in the resident parking. I have a bum knee so stairs are not my friend. The standard visitor parking in on the lowest level and is a bit of a hike and many stairs which is no issue for most travelers. There are no handicap parking stalls; all are on a first come basis so if you get back late at night, parking can be a challenge, but you can still avoid stairs by walking in a different door/elevator and making your way to the condo. The pool is three flights of stairs down; no elevator options. But, if you drive your car around to the pool there is a ramp up to the BBQ area to eliminate most of the stairs but you will still have about 10 steps up yo the pool to deal with. Unfortunately there is no wheelchair access to the pool.

Ray and Lise’s condo is an excellent choice for travellers who are not afraid to get away from the tourist hotspots and are willing and able to drive back and forth to the sights that you want to see.  The beaches on this side of the island are unreal! You have to see them to believe them.  Specifically Ray and Lise’s condo is very comfortable, with all amenities and a comfy bed.  We spent a lot of our days either touring the island or at the beach so we were very glad to have a comfy condo with Cable Tv to come home to in the evening.  \nThe views are spectacular!  The kitchen is well appointed and we cooked almost all our meals at the condo, or down at the bbq area. The pool area is very well kept, clean and quiet.  The grounds on the property are very pretty.  We experienced no noise issues while we were there.  The staff at this facility are very very friendly and we had no issues with checking in and getting around the property.  \nRay and Lise have beach chairs, coolers and umbrellas, snorkelling gear and books for their guests to use as needed. This was very helpful for us when we spent time at the beaches!\nRay and Lise’s communication throughout the booking process and leading up to the trip was impeccable. They answered all questions i had and were very quick to offer advise for our stay.  We knew exactly what to expect and were not caught off guard by anything when we arrived at their condo.  \nOverall this place is 5/5 for us and it was an experience we will never forget."},{"_id":"353176289","date":{"$date":"2018-11-26T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10266175","reviewer_id":"224560853","reviewer_name":"Anthony","comments":"Great place to stay away from the touristy parts of the island.

Andreia führte uns bei der Begrüßung nach oben und zeigte uns die Räumlichkeiten, welche den Eindruck bestätigen, der durch die Fotos entstanden ist: Für einen Kurztrip, wo ihr die meiste Zeit des Tages außerhalb verbringt. In der Parallelstraße überhalb der Rua das Flores befindet sich ein Supermarkt an dem wir uns mit dem nötigsten an Verpflegung für unseren Aufenthalt ausstatten konnten. Darüber hinaus gab uns Andreia viele Tipps zur Freizeitgestaltung in Porto. Sämtliche Anziehungspunkte sind aufgrund der zentralen Lage super einfach und in der Regel innerhalb von 10 - 15 Minuten Fußmarsch zu erreichen. An der angrenzenden Station Sao Bento fährt auch die Buslinie 500, welche euch in ca. 40 Minuten zum Stadtstrand in Matosinhos bringt. Wir haben die vier Tage in Porto sehr genossen und netterweise kümmerte sich Andreia am letzten Tag sogar noch darum, dass wir unser Gepäck nach dem Checkout sicher für ein paar Stunden verstauen konnten.

And the fact that it was a 5 minute drive from Volcano park was the icing on the cake. Mike is a real gentleman, informative, kind, and easy to contact. We will not forget the cherished experience he afforded. \n\n\nWe particularly enjoyed the cabin's  rare blend of rustic charm and meticulously maintained, modern elegance. The beautiful wood interior with exposed beams, light scent of cedar, old-fashioned fireplace, and free-standing antique tub, all made the cabin incredibly charming. The wrap-around porch was not only scenic, but very quiet and mosquito free. It was a wonderful place to chat in the evenings, read selections from the bookshelf, and to enjoy the delicious breakfast items provided, including fresh papaya. Since the cabin resides at the end of the residential area, the only thing visible for miles from the back porch was lush, pristine forest. The cabin's enveloping sense of privacy was relaxing and romantic. \n\nWith respect to the cabin's modern appeal, where does one begin? Even the toaster lowered the bread automatically. One can enjoy coffee prepared by three different methods, including French press, and Mike made sure we had ample amounts of freshly ground coffee. The stainless steel fridge was packed with complementary goodies as well. Being expert snackers, we were quite pleased. \n\nThis understood, the modern conveniences went far beyond food. We enjoyed being able to dim the lights just the right amount in each room to create the desired ambiance. The king-sized bed in the loft was incredibly comfortable and featured three types of pillows, including a memory foam option. But the aspect of our stay we liked the most had to do with the modern architecture of the cabin itself. The walls of the A-frame design, both behind the bed and in front of it, feature large windows with breathtaking views of the forest. As a result, the typical distinction between interior and exterior does not apply. The effect was magical. Waking up in the morning, we were in awe. \n\nThanks again for everything, Mike.

This house was modern with beautiful furniture, gorgeous floors, and beautiful bathtub/sinks/counters. There are so many windows. There is an L-shaped wrap around deck that is massive. We spent almost all of our time sitting out there on the comfortable patio furniture, listening to the jungle, drinking our freshly prepared 100% Hawaiin coffee that our host provided.

We never even saw any.) \n\nSpeaking of what the host provided for us: coffee, tea, oats, pancake mix, butter, sugar, syrup, fresh jam, eggs, orange juice, milk, chocolate, yogurt, and fruit.

The owner, Mike, was prompt and thorough with all communications and incredibly informative about directions, dining recommendations, and local attractions. His love of not only the cabin, but the local community and environment was evident in every facet of our stay. From the locally grown coffee, fresh baked banana bread, and organic whole milk to the unique iron claw bath tub, cozy cotton bath robes, and natural rainwater supply, every nook and cranny of this endearing cabin reflected Mikes attention to detail and reverence for nature. This true getaway will bring total relaxation secluded in a rain forest where the pitter-patter of rain on a tin roof will lull you into a deep sleep only to awaken the next morning to the cool crisp air echoing with exotic bird calls.

Die Lage, die Ausstattung, die Sauberkeit, bequemes Bett, alles hat gestimmt. \nMike ist sehr fürsorglich und er hat die Cabin liebevoll eingerichtet. Man spürt, dass es ihm wichtig ist, dass die Gäste sich wohl fühlen (mehrere Blumengestecke, kuscheliger Morgenmantel)). Er hat zur Benützung ausführliche Instruktionen gegeben (Papaya zum Frühstück schon vorbereitet) und war bei Fragen  erreichbar.  \nPreislich ist die Cabin eher im oberen Segment, aber für eine kleine Ferien-Hütte am Rand vom Naturschutztreservat mit Blick auf den wilden Urwald mit all seinen Annehmlichkeiten eigentlich unbezahlbar.\nEs kann bisweilen ziemlich kühl sein auf 1000 Fuss (?m), gegen Mittag fängt es auch häufig zu nieseln / regnen an. Hatte häufig meine Daunenjacke an, Heizungslüfter wäre bei Bedarf vorhanden. Ich habe 2 Nächte gebucht. Mit allem was es im Vulkanpark zu sehen gibt,  könnte man durchaus auch noch länger da verweilen. \n\nZusätzlich ist Mike als erfahrener \"Seebär\" (eigenes Schiff) darauf bedacht, dass auch Kleinigkeiten stimmen, die einem das Leben erleichtern ( hawaianische Musik ab MP3 Player, grosse Bibliothek über Hawaii ( Pflanzen, Tiere, Geschichtevetc etc). Er hat zudem ein grosses Wissen über einheimische Pflanzen und Tiere, die er einem gerne weitergibt.\nEr geht praktisch jeden Morgen zum Vulkan. Er hat mich spontan um 05 30 frühmorgends zum \"glow\"  mitgenommen (leuchten der Magma, am besten b Sonnen auf oder -Untergang sichtbar). Danach haben wir in der Militär- basis im Park gefrühstückt und über \"Gott ind die Welt\" gesprochen. \nThanks for all that, dear Mike. I appreciated my stay a lot.

If you're looking at other places, trust me when I tell you that you have found the perfect place in the Flying Cloud Cabin. I don't think I have enough space to really describe just how awesome of an experience Mike helped us have, but I'll definitely try.\r\n\r\nThe location is fantastic, and about as close as you can be to Volcano park without actually staying inside it. We were able to easily make our way to some of the most remote locations of the park without having to worry about when we would get back to the cabin. \r\n\r\nThe amenities were beyond belief. Mike provided a warm in-person greeting despite our late night arrival, and had just about everything ready that you could imagine. The fridge was well stocked with juice, jams, eggs, fruit, and a few other tasty treats ready for us to consume. He gave us a quick tour around, made sure we had an answer to all our questions, and even had two wonderfully fuzzy robes ready for us.\r\n\r\nIf you don't know what to do in Volcano, don't worry! Mike has great recommendations of what to do anywhere on the island, and gave us great ideas for where to go inside the park and around volcano as well.\r\n\r\nIf this hasn't convinced you already, I'm not sure what will.

This gave us enough time to explore VNP, drive to Kalapana and bike to the lava flow, and to just relax and enjoy the cabin. \n\nThe location is perfect. It's less than 10 minutes from the entrance of the park and we found ourselves going early in the morning to beat the crowd and after dark to see the volcano glow from the Jagger Museum. The cabin is completely secluded but only a short drive from the highway. Just over the highway there are several restaurants and convenience stores. We really enjoyed dinner at the Kilauea Lodge. \n\nThe cabin itself is beautiful and charming. Mike has thought of absolutely everything and was very attentive to any needs we had. We could see the sunrise from our bed and on a clear night we could see the moon and stars. The cabin can be chilly at night and the area can get cold and rainy, so pack accordingly.

(Don't miss the Volcano farmer's market if you're there on a Sunday morning.)\r\n\r\nIt's a luxury to have the half-bathroom upstairs in addition to the full one downstairs.

Mike provides a really nice spread for breakfast though (we had eggs, granola, yogurt, fresh papaya, english muffins, local spreads and jams, and a myriad of other things to fill us up), so chances are you won't need to buy much. Mike even dropped off a warm loaf of pumpkin bread one morning!\r\n\r\nMike seems to have thought of everything you could possibly need while at his place - he has binoculars, headlamps and maps available for trips to the park, lots of blankets to keep you warm, and he even offered to start a fire for us.

There are so many things to say here, but I'll just focus on the two most important and overarching areas of interest: the host and the home. The most accurate description I can relinquish of this host (Mike) is that he was kind, organized, informed, and impressively meticulous in his attention to detail. We actually ran into him by coincidence while out hiking the VNP trails and we were glad to share in part of a hike with him to have the chance to get to know him better. Our brief Mike-guided tour was just a nice bonus as he is an admirable conversationalist with an interesting life and is very knowledgeable of the VNP area. We have personally ranked him as our overall best host in all of our AirBnB stays to date, and that is saying a lot as we have been very fortunate to have nearly all positive experiences via AirBnB. Albeit, Mike sets the bar really high; the previous makes sense given he basically lives in the clouds in the shadow of a volcano. The home was incredible and in retrospect remains our favorite place we stayed this year on the islands of Hawaii and Maui (out of 7 other homes and/or hotels). Mike has obviously placed a lot of consideration into this offering and continues to build upon a rock solid foundation of thoughtful hosting. He easily supplies every utensil, comfort, amenity, and convenience you could expect and/or want in this upscaled cabin. There are all the expected and unexpected kitchen fixings, a small library in a large wall-shelf filled with Hawaii-centric materials, several dehumidifiers, music and lighting that just delivers a very creature-comfort cabin experience, and a slew of other add-ons provided to make life just a little easier on your trip. The interior of this house has so many fine things it's hard to list but our personal favorites were the 100-year old clawfoot tub (also functions as a standing shower), the tempur-pedic bed and ultra comfortable bedding, and last but not least the carefully selected combinations of wood all throughout the house, which make it feel like it's both somewhere old and somewhere new to its guest as well as blends the home into its earthy and forested setting just outside the glass doors. The lanai wraps around the unit and makes for an amazingly tranquil place to eat a meal or listen and watch the rain. The surrounding area is residential but spread out and Mike's place seems like it's in own little universe, tucked between the trees. We found the flying cloud was easy to find (via GPS) and an absolutely perfect spot for those looking to enjoy the VNP as its very close (\u003c10mins) and makes for a seems-to-good-to-be-true home base. There are plenty of other things I could continue on to say in..."},{"_id":"122743156","date":{"$date":"2016-12-25T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10280433","reviewer_id":"6068562","reviewer_name":"Srihari","comments":"The best bnb experience we ever had - Mike's warm hospitality, the sound and view of the rainforest surrounding the cabin, the cabin itself (well designed, open, clean and well stocked), and the proximity to the National park.\n\nMike is a very friendly and warm person.

From waiting in the driveway with an umbrella to carry our bags and protect us from the rain upon our arrival to dropping off freshly baked pumpkin bread one morning, he thinks of everything and is a very kind and considerate person. This was by far the most thorough check-in I've ever had on AirBnB, as he walked us through every detail of the cottage that we would need to know, including the many different approaches to coffee-making that were available! I'm sure he would have been happy to help if we had any questions, but he was so thorough in explanations of not only the cottage but also the national park and the Volcano community that we never had any. He obviously loves this cottage very much and you will too. \n\nMy only tip is that it does get cool in the mornings and evenings. Mike warned us about this and provided firewood, a space heater and fluffy robes so it's not a problem, but my tip is to make bring some warm lounge-wear to make the mornings and evenings even cosier, which not everybody would think about planning a trip to Hawaii.

My husband fell almost immediately upon entering it --the tub is simply unsafe.  As a result, we did not stay and found accommodations elsewhere.  The home appeared clean but the host was clearly obsessed and spent a full hour telling us the do's \u0026 don'ts, while our dinners got cold and we were shivering on the porch... Ex: don't cook steak (no ventilation), don't leave the bathroom door open (humidity issue), don't wear shoes in the house, don't bring your suitcases upstairs to the bedroom, don't be concerned that the bedroom has no curtains, don't use the lights or the space heater too much because electricity is expensive in Hawaii, don't be alarmed to see the host working in the yard during our stay, and don't be alarmed if the host comes into the house while we're gone to get his yard tools, and on and on for an hour.  The whole experience was bizarre and uncomfortable.  The host wouldn't leave until we told him we had heard enough, that it was very late, that our dinners were now cold and so were we, and our groceries were sitting on the counter unpacked.  About an hour after the host finally left, my husband attempted to bathe and fell in the tub.  He could barely get out of the tub without falling again.  In all our stays in private homes and hotels, we have never previously experienced a tub so slippery.  While we were willing to overlook the host's bizarre behavior and rules, the unsafe tub was unacceptable.

When we arrived at his house a little early, he was nothing but welcoming and informative.  He went around and showed us his stunning home, a little piece of paradise, and fully equipped with anything you could need.  He supplied us with a wonderful breakfast spread (inc but not limited to coffee, eggs, papaya, cereal, oatmeal, yogurt- and all different varieties to choose from!)  He was nothing but helpful, occasionally checking in on us to see if we needed anything via the airbnb app.  We would often come back from the day to find he restocked all the food and even cleaned the sheets/towels mid-way through our stay (we stayed an entire week.)  He was helpful but also respected our privacy - we never saw him our entire stay.  \n\nThe pictures of the house do not do it justice.  It feels very secluded and yet is a minute from the main town road and a minute drive to Volcano National Park.  He has beach towels, a cooler, water bottles, head lamps for night walks, cozy blankets, plenty of pots/pans and other cooking supplies and spices you may need.  Mike also has a suggestion box in case we thought of something to make the place better, but we couldn't think of anything!\n\nAll in all, great location (short drive to Hilo, we rented jeep and traveled the whole island during our stay.), cozy and secluded house, great supplies, and a generous and helpful host.

We missed viewing the first night because we hit some fog but were able to return the following night to an intensely beautiful milky way/night sky contrasted with the glorious glow of Kilauea. Although Volcano is remote, it is a great set up to check out the green and black sand beaches. Mike is so thoughtful and aware of some of the limitations of the small town, he provided a wonderful little spread so that we might enjoy home-cooked breakfast and teas. He also has an extensive coffee setup for coffee folks as well. We slept very well and there are extra touches like comfortable bedding and thick towels that show Mike's put a lot of thought into folks' stays. It does get chilly in volcano but he's got that covered too; there is rain gear, a little stove that can be lit and small space heater if the temps dip.

The space is lovely - it's nestled in the woods, beautifully designed, really quiet and serene, and you wake up to the sound of birds chirping every morning.\n\nBut what really makes this place special is the amount of thought Mike has put into creating this space. It's extremely well-stocked, the lights in different parts of house are synchronized in a smart-home way, there's an iPad set up with playlist of soothing Hawaiian music and relevant info about the weather and volcanos. \n\nI so wish we could stay longer.

Mike is attentive to every detail, the masterful gardening of this rainforest location, the peaceful lighting that he has fine tuned in the cabin, and the collection of music and books all set the stage for relaxation and clearing your mind of the world, focusing on what matters in life, the journey.

You found it. Perfect if you want to be off the grid , hidden and left to your own imagination. There is adequate wi-fi when you need it. I travel for a living so the last thing I want on vaca is a stale hotel room. Flying cloud is a very private and cozy retreat. We picked this place out of many others that were available in the area because we wanted a nature infused seclusion. We have a 5 yr old daughter left back home with grandma and this was exactly what we needed. Easy access to Hilo , Volcano and other points of interest on the island. I proposed to my long time (15yr) side kick during a day trip to the southern most point of US. I’ve been to 42 of the 50 states now and i have to say the big island is one of the most beautiful scenic places I have ever experienced. Stay here you won’t be disappointed. Mike was great upon check in. Extremely thorough and engaging. After the initial orientation we never saw him again.

The apartment was spacious enough for us (a family of four) and the location was amazing.  You are steps to Central Park and to the 86th subway.  There are wonderful restaurants and shopping nearby if you need that but the small kitchen is fine for quick snacks and breakfast.  It was especially nice to sit on the little patio to eat my toast and tea and even with the NYC humming around you it is lovely to have an outdoor space.  Chas answered all my many questions with great patience and care...he really wanted us to have a wonderful time and went beyond the call of duty by even sending us links to good places to watch big soccer matches.  The apartment was clean when we arrived and had the basic things we needed such as towels and extra sheets.  While not the cheapest option on BNB it gave us all a wonderful bed to sleep in, space to spread out in when needed, and a fantastic location!  We even found street parking for the full 5 days!  Picking up the keys was a breeze and we left a few basic things for the next guests to enjoy from the corner store.   It is a gorgeous street to stay on and felt very safe. Thank you so much Chas!  We hope to return one day soon."},{"_id":"377728","date":{"$date":"2011-07-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"102995","reviewer_id":"586633","reviewer_name":"Sheree","comments":"Our stay in New York at this apartment was vastly superior to staying at a hotel.  The location is perfect particularly for those wanting access to Central Park and the museum mile (Guggenheim etc) but it was also a revelation to explore that end of Broadway.  The apartment is lovely and has everything.  We especially appreciated the study nook and ability to use our laptop with wifi access and the well equipped kitchen for easy prep for meals (and deli close by makes it so easy to stock up).  The lounge, bedroom and bathroom are all in good, comfortable condition.  The little balconies and view of the courtyard topped it off.

There are so many details -- from the art on the walls to the spices in the kitchen -- that make it feel like a home away from home. The apartment is small but imminently comfortable with high ceilings and patios that make it feel spacious. The unit is off the street (on a courtyard)  so it was very quiet (that  and the comfortable bed made for great nights of sleeping). It's a beautiful street, just off Central Park and just around the corner from the subway. There are abundant restaurants within a 5 minute walk and the best coffee in NY (Joe's) is only about two blocks away. Chas was a great host who was quick to answer all our questions and make our stay as enjoyable as possible. We had our two sons with us (ages 10 and 12) and the living arrangements were ideal for a family our size.

We had not used AirBnB before, but the whole process ran very smoothly. Both Chas and Paul were quick at answering emails and provided us with plenty of information re local grocery shops etc. The pick-up of the keys was also very simple. \r\nThe apartment is in a great location, half a block from Central Park and close to several subway lines. Only up one flight of stairs, which was good because there are no lifts! \r\nThe apartment was very well equipped with everything you need for a stay away from home - bedding, towels, full kitchen etc. It was a bit smaller than it appears in the photos and could do with a lick of paint, but was very clean and had plenty of storage. Also, keep in mind that the beds in the loft may provide a bit of a problem for some guests - definitely best for kids. \r\nOverall, we had a great time at Chas' apartment and would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to visit New York!

We took Ade up on some recommended places to eat and they were all great local places, well researched.\r\n\r\nIt was easy walking distance to all points of interest in Williamsburg, from the vintage market to the regular street food festival and East River Ferry, providing access to other parts of Brooklyn, downtown NYC and Governor's Island.  \r\n\r\nThe short walk to different subways meant getting into the city was very fast, particularly areas such as East Village and Park Slope.  We regularly went from the heart of the city back to the apartment within 20-30 minutes, a good escape when the crowds got too much in  Manhattan.\r\n\r\nAde welcomed in and helped us up with the bags on day 1.  There is no lift but compared to subways, a few flights of stairs was not a problem.  Again, on departure day she was very accommodating letting us leave the bags and helping us with getting them down again."},{"_id":"14937315","date":{"$date":"2014-06-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"103161","reviewer_id":"12438032","reviewer_name":"Anne","comments":"Ade's place was terrific.

It's clean and well decorated, quite roomy (at least compared to NYC hotels), and very convenient. It has a clean, nice shower, a comfortable bed, a roomy sitting area and a writing desk. It also has a small, very practical kitchen that you can use to cook meals when not eating out. There's a medium size flat screen TV in the bedroom, with Netflix, and the internet wifi connection, which is immensely important to me as a tech guy on the go, was lightning fast.\r\n\r\nThe building is a little old and unkept, but don't let that scare you - the apartment is in perfect condition. Do be aware that it's on the 4th floor and the stairwell is quite steep, so don't stay here if you have a disability or very small children.\r\n\r\nThe most wonderful thing about the apartment is the neighbourhood. Williamsburg is charming, and there are numerous cafes, bars and restaurants literally a few steps away. I particularly liked \"Samurai Mama\" and \"Snacky\", check them out if you're into Asian food. There's also the Williamsburg Music Hall and the Knitting Factory - well known venues where you can sample the local rock bands. And, importantly, the streets felt to me safe enough to walk around alone at night.\r\n\r\nThe apartment is a few minutes away from the subway station where you can take the L train to Manhattan - a few stations away.\r\n\r\nAde herself was friendly and very helpful. I found her to be the perfect host - responsive enough when I needed her, but she didn't bother me at all when I didn't.\r\n\r\nI travel to NYC a lot, and I will be more than happy to stay at Ade's again next time I get there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"_id":"23744335","date":{"$date":"2014-12-09T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"103161","reviewer_id":"10609989","reviewer_name":"Dani","comments":"Passei dez dias com meu marido no apartamento de Adela em Williamsburg.

The apartment is less than a half a block off of Bedford at a location that has a lot of good local bars and restaurants.  We felt very safe though there is a vacant lot that you could walk by on her street.  However, we did not make much of it, but you could walk on the other side of the street if that bothers you.  The street is well lit.  We worried a little about noise given Williamsburg's reputation for hipness.  However, this ended up not being a problem.  Restaurants were still open after 9, but you could still walk into them without reservations.  At night, it was busy enough to feel safe, but it was sparse enough for it to be farely quiet.\n\nGetting into Manhattan can be an issue.  The L train is the only train coming into the neighborhood.  If it isn't running, the closest stop is Marcy at the end of the Williamsburg bridge which is probably a 30 minute walk.  The ferry, which is a bargain, is close and will cross the East River and drop you off at 34th close to the UN Building.  However, it does not run after 9:30 in the evening.\n\nAde's building is a little ratty which you will see in the stairwell.  However, her apartment is perfectly fine.  The bed is comfortable which is nice compared to most Air BNB hosts.  There is a window unit AC for the entire apartment.  Depending on the time of year, I am not sure if it will cool the bedroom well since it's in a different part of the apartment (though there is an oscillating fan there).  We did not have a problem since it was October.  There is no microwave oven.  It is four flights up with pretty large stairs and no elevator.  I would avoid this apartment if you are elderly or handicapped.\n\nWe did not meet Ade which it is getting pretty common not to meet the host.  However, we had no problems.  The process to get the key was easy.  She had recommendations printed and posted in the room, and she was quick to respond to questions by messaging.\n\nFor our purposes, this was a great place to consider if the L train is running.  We would not stay her again if the L train isn't running.  However, if you don't mind working around the ferry schedule and you want to visit Williamsburg and Greenpoint, this will work well for you."},{"_id":"354879082","date":{"$date":"2018-12-02T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"103161","reviewer_id":"42046158","reviewer_name":"Jeff","comments":"Great location!"},{"_id":"414047344","date":{"$date":"2019-02-18T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"103161","reviewer_id":"39745252","reviewer_name":"Rachel","comments":"Ade’s apartment was clean, cozy, and in the heart of Williamsburg.

The entire island is out of this world beautiful, but this property's secluded location and private beach make the ocean views that much more special and breathtaking. I booked the home as accommodation for my wedding party guests (my husband and I had a small, beach wedding in the North Shore) and it was perfect. We had everything we needed and the extra beds in each room saved me headache and money - very efficient! Noah was also quite accommodating when I told him our original plan of having the ceremony on the private beach and outside reception in the backyard (which we didn't wind up doing) - he was totally cool with it. Overall, a wonderful Hawaii experience in a lovely beach home where I felt at home and completely relaxed.

From the moment you walk into the front door, you have stunning views of the ocean. We enjoyed breathtaking sunrises from the master bedroom and outdoor sunbathing pad almost every day. We chose this location for our intimate wedding ceremony and casual dinner for about 45 friends and family. We originally planned both the ceremony and dinner outdoors, but due to the unusually windy weather, we decided to host the dinner in the spacious living room instead, which worked out great. Noah was very responsive and helpful before we arrived in Hawaii, as well as throughout the wedding weekend. Unlike previous reviewers, we had no issues with the hot water, the floors were clean when we arrived, and flies only became an issue when we left the doors open for long periods of time. There wasn't any sand on the beach in early March, but the water was calm and protected - perfect for wading around with water shoes. The house was fully stocked with amenities, and in a fantastic location if you're looking to get away from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki and Honolulu. I would highly recommend staying at Noah's beach house, and hope to find another reason to stay again in the future.

Around the corner is Pounders beach which has some decent waves for boogie boarding. It is a 5 minute walk to the Polynesian Cultural Center and about an hour from Honolulu.

The host was extremely easy to work with and had pre-stocked the house with pots/pans, paper towels, coffee, toilet paper, etc.\n\nThe best part about this house was the location, being right on the coast.  There is a nice back patio, and another concrete slab by the water with steps leading down to the beach.

We are a family of three who have been to Hong Kong a number of times.  Although we usually stay in a hotel on Hong Kong Island, we decided to stay in Jenkin's place due to the price, apparent cleanliness, and in order to better experience life in Kowloon.  We were definitely not disappointed.  The unit is quite small but they make efficient use of the space and the reality is that it was more spacious than any hotel room, aside from the most deluxe suites. Location wise it doesn't get any better.  Just steps from Tsim Sha Tsui (TST), and then everything that TST has to offer readily at hand.  Shopping and eating for all price ranges and tastes.

Host service is a close second. Jenkin is an accessible and attentive host, and that's something you may need in a complicated city like Hong Kong. This is an efficiently designed very small space which makes it seem larger than it is. The layout is (1) a bed-sized sleeping area with a curtain and sliding door for privacy; (2) a comfortably sized and appointed bathroom with a nicely tiled shower with plenty of hot water and strong water pressure; and (3) a living room with comfortable sofa, reliable wifi, and clothes hanging rack. There is a fridge and microwave and hotplate, with enough cookware for two people. You wash your dishes in the bathroom.  All three rooms are recently remodeled and tiled.  The bed is very comfortable. Both the bedroom and living room have air conditioners.\r\n\r\nThe little apartment is on the 6th floor of an old and dingy (but clean) Kowloon apartment building one block from the stunning fountains of Kowloon Park and the subway, and a million places right there in your face.  It is a 10 minute exciting walk (as in every single time its exciting) to the picturesque  harbor ferry to Hong Kong Island (or you can take the subway there).  Like many Asian buildings, the elevators are very slow and often crowded with friendly people, but remarkably, each floor has an elevator on either end of the hallway. You walk out of Jenkin's apartment, look left and look right to see which elevator will arrive first, a fun little game for us. \r\n\r\nThe very safe neighborhood is extremely trendy, filled with excited locals and tourists, and many places open until late. (My favorite bar and restaurant were open until 3am, both very funky). \r\n\r\nI might stay in one of Jenkin's larger units next time but, you know, I'm not sure since this little place just grows on you after two days.  He is a master host, his cleaning lady is so nice and right nearby, and he takes a lot of pride in making your stay high quality.  He even guided our taxi driver to the front door by cell phone, and he is always, always accessible.  It's remarkable. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"_id":"73506770","date":{"$date":"2016-05-08T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10343118","reviewer_id":"65460950","reviewer_name":"Jj","comments":"我们去玩迪士尼很晚回来害怕要找一段时间,地理交通条件好出地铁口走几步就到了,很容易就能找到｡去维多利亚港看完夜景回来到楼下有便利店茶餐厅吃点东西非常方便,房子感觉卫生,有电视和无线网络整体感觉不错!"},{"_id":"74234498","date":{"$date":"2016-05-14T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10343118","reviewer_id":"31011591","reviewer_name":"Alan","comments":"The apartment is in a great location for exploring the Tsim Sha Sui area.

The living space is small but well organized, with a separate bedroom (just big enough for the bed) with its own air-con, and the bathroom is a very usable size. The main drawback to the apartment is that it is on the 6th floor of a 15 floor building and the queues can get long for the elevator. There is one elevator at each end of the long hall on the 6th floor but on the ground level they are completely separated.  A few times I waited on the ground floor in a queue for 15-20 minutes and the elevator fills up before being able to get in, so plan your trips, don't expect to go in and out a lot, and avoid mid-day and evening hours when people are coming home.  Of course this is not an issue the host can resolve, but I think any guests should anticipate."},{"_id":"74369812","date":{"$date":"2016-05-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10343118","reviewer_id":"69166808","reviewer_name":"曦子","comments":"地理位置很棒 (Hidden by Airbnb) 都比较方便"},{"_id":"76222226","date":{"$date":"2016-05-25T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10343118","reviewer_id":"70462561","reviewer_name":"大華","comments":"位置十分方便 近地鐵站 商場 晚上吃東西都方便\r\n房間有點小  浴室更小  有許多雜物堆放在櫃子裡  打掃也不乾淨  沙發上有需多頭髮  垃圾桶只有一個  因為不知去哪倒  對旅行的的人來說 不夠使用   \r\n浴室一沖水 浴簾就會亂飄 常會黏到身上  老實說以房間的價格還是打過折的  不如住飯店  既沒有價格優勢  環境也不太ok  "},{"_id":"77360245","date":{"$date":"2016-05-31T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10343118","reviewer_id":"44915148","reviewer_name":"Jesse","comments":"Host was very friendly and accommodating!

Lovely Kowloon Park is very close by as well. The building is older, but it does have an elevator. \nThe apartment is really just a room that is divided into a tiny sleeping area with a sliding glass panel and curtain. There is no kitchen just a fridge, hot water kettle and some dishes, cups, etc. There is no place to even wash cups or dishes other than the bathroom. The apartment is nicely renovated and decorated and the bed and couch are comfortable. The shower pressure is good. It is in a busy shopping and restaurant area but it was quiet enough at night for us to sleep with earplugs. \nWe had a problem at check in. We needed an early check in and I asked for this before booking. Phoebe, the co-host assured me several times that we could arrive early and I reconfirmed the time after I booked it. Unfortunately, Phoebe did not tell her assistant and we arrived to find ourselves locked out. We messaged James and the only response we got was to contact Phoebe. Phoebe couldn’t be reached- later when we spoke she explained that she had lost her phone for a period of time. She was very apologetic and brought us a bottle of wine. No corkscrew in the apartment but still nice of her. The next day we were able to store our luggage for a couple of hours without a problem. \n\nThis place is nice but understand that it is basically a hotel room. I don’t know the prices of hotels in that area but I suspect they’re much higher. It’s a clean, comfortable room in a great location."},{"_id":"230795843","date":{"$date":"2018-01-29T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10343118","reviewer_id":"66459493","reviewer_name":"Isabel","comments":"Good location  very convenient"},{"_id":"231612401","date":{"$date":"2018-02-02T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10343118","reviewer_id":"136320456","reviewer_name":"译","comments":"很棒的房间,虽然有点小,不过在市中心这个价格性价比很高了!而且房东响应很迅速!有设备不会用,五分钟内就到了,也很热情!"},{"_id":"236939924","date":{"$date":"2018-02-21T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10343118","reviewer_id":"166506033","reviewer_name":"海霞","comments":"挺方便的,就是过年期间去确实人多什么都贵"},{"_id":"238059841","date":{"$date":"2018-02-25T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10343118","reviewer_id":"139803774","reviewer_name":"Sandrine","comments":"This appartement is very well located next the MTR station and Nathan Road commercial avenue.

The location is unbeatable, steps from MTR exit, park, mosque, shops, all that TST and HK have to offer.  There's an excellent fried-bao shop on the ground floor!  Finally, the check-in/out was super-easy, and communication with the manager was always rapid and obliging.

So groovy in its 60's mod building - such cool mid-century flourishes.  Perfect for 6, but large enough for 8.  Really huge for an in-city apartment.  Great kitchen, comfortable living room, and just a really cozy and nice apartment to come home to each day after exploring.  Two bathrooms - a rarity in Europe - and a lift in the building for hauling your bags up the stairs.  A little bit out of the tourist center, which in our view provided a more authentic experience.  Great place!"},{"_id":"198098320","date":{"$date":"2017-09-28T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1036027","reviewer_id":"57313712","reviewer_name":"Iva","comments":"Christinin smještaj je odličan izbor za posjet Portu za veći broj ljudi.

Подъезд закрывается на ключ и в маленькой коморке в подвальчике обязательно кто-то дежурит из людей Османа. Рядом с домом есть супермаркет CARREFOUR, что очень хорошо.

There was a problem with the plumbing in the bathroom, some leaking around the base of the toilet - which made the small bathroom quite wet. Osman offered to have it fixed while we were there to be fair, but we didn't want a tradesman through during our stay. It will hopefully be repaired when you stay here.

The cottage is very comfortable and equipped with everything you need.   The space is open and roomy, even more so than the listing pics suggest.   As with many Hawaiian dwellings, there are lots of windows, and the cottage offers an open air, indoor/outdoor style of living.   \r\n\r\nAlso of note: the bed is new and king-sized, and is super comfortable-- one of the best I've slept on lately.  Its wonderfully supportive and guarantees a great night's sleep.  Internet access and speeds were very good, something of a priority for me.   Washer and drier out the back door was also a plus.   Out the front door is a picnic table  (put to good use everyday),  and a shady sitting area under a blooming Hong Kong Orchid tree-- delightful.\r\n\r\nThe cottage basically sits on its own parcel, with your own private driveway, and so it offers good privacy.   The location is somewhat off the beaten path, which I found desirable, as areas of the North Shore can get busy at times.  Still, there's easy access to area beaches, shopping in Haleiwa, the weekend farmer's market's, etc.   And then there's literally miles of amazing beaches to explore from the cottage to Ka'ena Point.   \r\n\r\nSaving the best for last: Bobby and Mike are excellent hosts and genuinely lovely people-- the aloha spirit here is awesome.  Both are very friendly and  accommodating,  generously sharing weekend BBQ dishes (delicious!) and providing a fresh pineapple to welcome their guest.   I had a great time at the Banyan Bungalow-- only wish I could have stayed longer.

Her directions were clear and it was easy to find.  I had my own drive and garden, complete with outdoor table and grill.  The cottage was exactly as in the pictures and Bobby had left some local treats including freshly laid eggs from her own hens for me! The area is so safe you don't need to shut the doors and it is quiet as anything-except for the wild roosters, but these are everywhere in Hawaii and you get used to them very quickly.  The beach is a short walk away, and Bobby loaned me a beach cruiser bicycle so I could ride into the North Shore town of Haleiwa which was on bike paths all the way.  The cottage also has a great outdoor shower which is perfect for ending a trip to the beach.\r\n\r\nWaialua is the real Hawaii, it is quiet and away from most of the touristy stuff and it was very nice not to be in Wakiki!  But still only a short drive to historic Haleiwa which has restaurants and shops.  I cooked for myself most evenings in the cottage which was easy enough on the hot plate and the cottage was very peaceful in the evening, with fantastic starts to be watched from the garden after dark.   Bobby also brought me fresh pineapple from the plantation and the mangos at this time of year were so delicious- another fantastic touch!\r\n\r\nI'd really recommend staying with Bobby if you are looking for a peaceful, North Shore, real Hawaii stay.  It was absolutely fantastic-and the bed is massive and super comfortable!  Great value and really super!   Bobby is a great host, she was really welcoming and always contactable but left me to my privacy too.  She went out of her way to help me get some mail I was expecting and had great recommendations about the area.

Located on the beautiful North Shore, this rental is peaceful and perfectly situated to allow you to have an amazing time exploring the island. Very close to Ka'ena Point, where we saw wild whales migrating off the coast, and to the lovely surf town of Hale'iwa. There's a secluded beach in close walking distance, and we also used our rental car to explore some of the incredible beaches within a short drive, like Waimea Bay. The space itself was clean and well-equipped, with a very comfortable king size bed! Bobby was very easy to communicate with and we felt so well taken care of, right down to the arrival treats that were left for us (very appreciated after a long flight!). I'll echo what some others have mentioned here, which is to bring earplugs for nighttime sleeping, as there are junglefowl all over the island (wild chickens!) and the roosters do like to announce their presence at all hours - you'll hear this everywhere you go. I highly recommend this Airbnb rental!

I absolutely loved Bobby's cottage in Waialua! The cottage was so peaceful and relaxing. I was so happy with how private the space was. Just like the ad described, it has its own driveway and completely private space, the adjacent houses were even separated by a fence.  The space was clean, comfortable, and well stocked with games, towels, snacks, and other supplies. I wish we didn't have to run around so much that weekend so that we could have enjoyed the cottage more. We didn't even get to cut open the fresh pineapple that Bobby left for us! Although I did enjoy the crackers and peanut butter :) \n\nThis is the perfect weekend getaway for locals, or vacation spot for out of towners looking for a peaceful getaway. If you want to be be closer to the hustle and bustle, then I would look for a place closer to Haleiwa or Sunset. It is pretty quiet here (minus the roosters in the am), and other than the beach, it is not really walking distance to much. Which we loved actually :) Also, I really appreciated that Bobby was readily available to help with directions and check-in details, but more importantly that she gave us privacy and space once we checked in. \n\nIf I ever need to come back up the North Shore for a relaxing weekend, I would certainly book again!

The bungalow is clean, open, and roomy, with a giant, comfortable California King size bed in the middle and a kitchen housing all the essentials (glasses, plates, silverware, coffee maker, ice trays, etc.). \n\nThere is also a television and WiFi available, which we used to connect to Spotify for some music. But oh, the sounds, the sounds, the sounds!\n\nI actually chose this reservation because of the reviews which described the sounds of the North Shore. I love chickens and birds and grew up with their gentle AM serenades, therefore this place was perfect. The roosters sang to impress while other birds crooned and cackled, creating a beautiful medley of island sounds that makes this place unique.\n\nThere is a giant yard and private gate on the outside of the bungalow, and an outdoor shower which was perfect for hosing off all the sand from the luscious beach. \n\nAnd the beach, what a beach it was! Upon arrival Bobby and her partner greeted us with a fresh pineapple and gave us directions to the ocean and encouraged us to use their cruiser bicycles. The beach is about a ten-minute walk or a three-minute bike ride -- either journey is pleasant, with the bike ride maybe being better because it gets you there faster.\n\nPicture all the noise and umbrellas and kayaks and floaties of Waikiki Beach, and all the surfers and gatherers of those at say, Banzai Pipeline, and then picture the exact opposite. The beach in this spot was quiet, with gentle, clean waves and at most I saw a maximum of about eight other people who were either snorkeling or just hanging out with dogs.\n\nAt one point, after relaxing on the beach for so long, my partner and I took a nap and were awakened by a friendly pooch named Tucker, who was all smiles as we gave him pets and ear scratches (sorry if that was TMI, we are dog people after all).\n\nI could yam on and on about this place, but I think I've done all the yamming I could possible yam.\n\nI give this place ten stars out of five, and the hosts also ten stars out of five.\n\nDid I mention we really enjoyed our stay?"},{"_id":"152686437","date":{"$date":"2017-05-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10392282","reviewer_id":"6031468","reviewer_name":"Hannah","comments":"My Husband and I absolutely loved out stay in Bobby's Bungalow.

Very nice, spacious and ideal for a couple. The place is very well decorated, a nice large bed and enough room to really make you feel at home. Very private setting, including private access and parking.\nThe host was very accomodating and communication was nearly immediate. In fact, on our last morning I texted to let her know we'd be going for a quick snorkle at Wiamea Bay (15 min drive) and back by 9:30 to check out at 10. She was gracious enough to allow for a later checkout which turned out to be marvelous. \nYou must have a car to stay here. No public transportation available and Uber would be potentially challenging.\nThe beach at the end of the street (down the street, take a right for a short distance) was fantastic for a semi-private location with good swimming. The water is fairly shallow with ok snorkeling. Bikes had flat tires so we drove. Not a huge deal. \nThe Roosters - I have to say that as charming as the chickens and chicks are that roam the North Shore (we have some at home), the roosters are quite challenging in the mornings, and for certain guests, this could be a deal breaker for this particular location. We did have one night that a couple in the neighborhood tested their vocal cords at 3:30 am for a few minutes. I'd be lying if I didn't say that I wanted to strangle a few of them, but we were up and going each morning anyway so this wasn't a deal breaker for us. \nWe loved this location and would stay again."},{"_id":"243983470","date":{"$date":"2018-03-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10392282","reviewer_id":"140981747","reviewer_name":"Mike","comments":"This bungalow is quiet and accommodating.

The bikes were great, we rode those to the beach and into the main town of Haleiwa (about 5 miles). They provide a lock so it allowed us to adventure and get some breakfast.

Uma consequência disso eh que tive que gastar 30 euros com ligações telefônicas usando um chip francês quando cheguei no aeroporto para me comunicar com ela e perguntar coisas básicas que não foram informadas: número da rua, com quem pegaríamos a chave, o horário em que poderíamos entrar etc\n- além disso, apesar de ter usado o Airbnb inúmeras vezes, essa é a primeira vez que ninguém nos recebeu. Não vimos a anfitriã ou a agência que ela contrata ou outra pessoa em nenhum momento. Nós chegamos, pedimos as chaves ao porteiro, a maneira de abrir a garagem, onde estacionar, por onde entrar quando chegamos da praia etc. Fomos perguntando quando as dúvidas surgiam pq ninguém nos fez uma apresentação do lugar. Eles vendem um serviço como se fosse um produto, e sem muito atendimento ao cliente.\n- o lugar estava empoeirado. Nitidamente ninguém realizou uma limpeza previa à nossa chegada. Não era nada gritante,  mas bolas de poeira e sujeira no chão do quarto e embaixo dos móveis podiam ser vistas com facilidade\n- a cafeteira estava quebrada, e como eu não tinha muita esperança de que alguém se dispusesse a ir até lá, resolvi comprar uma cafeteira por 80 reais, que depois deixamos com familiares no RJ. O objetivo não era de comprá-la, mas devido aos fatos expostos acima fizemos um cálculo de custo/benefícios e nos resignamos na compra de uma cafeteira que não precisaríamos depois\n- o ar condicionado dos quartos tem apenas dois modos: desligado ou frio glacial, o que nos força a ligar e desligar constantemente pra manter uma temperatura razoável, inclusive no meio da noite. Em um dos quartos ele é bem barulhento. O ar condicionado da sala também tem dois modos apenas: desligado ou fraquinho, o que é particularmente chato quando se está na cozinha quente que não se resfria com ele (a cozinha é americana e dá sobre a sala)\n- por último, mas isso é menos importante pq a piscina fecha cedo, quando alguém nada nela uma das varandas treme bastante, o que reverbera sobre o quarto, fazendo um barulho como se alguém no andar de cima estivesse pulando.\n\nEm resumo, o apartamento em si é bom, mas a ausência quase total de manutenção e alguém pra auxiliar com coisas tão simples como apresentar o lugar, informar horários, dizer o endereço exato, dizer as regras do lugar, substituir uma cafeteira quebrada ou limpar o apartamento de vez em quando faz com que ele esteja caro para o serviço prestado.\n\nEsperamos ter ajudado outras pessoas a tomar uma escolha sábia, e também esperamos que a anfitriã  se torne mais presente na plataforma e pressione a agência que ela contrata para melhorar determinados pontos do serviço proposto.\n\nDanilo \u0026 Marine"}]}

The kitchen is well equipped. This place could be used just as easily for a long stay as it was for our shorter one. We were there for three days. Leslie was a very thoughtful host, leaving wine and chocolates in the fridge, and even brought by Band-Aids for me when I got a really bad blister from my new shoes. \n\nDOWNSIDES:\nAs mentioned in previous reviews, the basement holds moisture. As long as you keep using the de-humidifier, you’ll be okay. \n\nA major problem we had was Sydney’s inconsistent public transit, more specifically the buses. If you’re used to relying on transit, look for a place that is closer to the central parts of town. I think of all the buses we took, we had ONE arrive on time. Some showed up 10 minutes after the scheduled time, and one didn’t even show up at all. So, look for something nearer the main harbour or CBD, or you can do like we did a lot of the time: walk down to the Manly Wharf (about 25 min walk) and take the ferry to the main harbour, and only stick to the areas that are closest. Honestly, take the ferries as much as possible. The views are phenomenal.

Shopping and tasty gelato (our kids were staunch advocates for the Messina Gelato) were only a slight stone's throw further away on Hall St. \r\n\r\nHaving coffee available in the morning was a particular treat (thank you again, Cat), and there were ample cookbooks to review if we had had the time to really use the kitchen. Communications with Cat were easy for checking in and out; we didn't need to trouble her during our visit because the replacement light bulbs were easy to find when one fixture burnt out.

Lots of shops and good restaurants within easy walking distance, and the beach is just as close. There's even a funky little nine hole golf course close by. It's perched on a cliff that overlooks the ocean and has million dollar views.\n\nThe house worked well for five adults (one couple and three others) and was clean and well appointed. There are even cookbooks displayed in the kitchen in case you wanted to get adventurous. One of the bedrooms is in a guesthouse in the back yard and it was a nice place for the couple to sleep and be apart form the others. Be prepared for visiting bugs, though.\n\nBelieve Cat when she says that you won't be able to park inside the gate without a high clearance vehicle but you will be able to park in the driveway if your car is on the small side. We had a minivan that was simply too big to allow for pedestrians pushing baby strollers to get by. Parking on the street is for two hours only and the nearest long-term free parking is s few blocks away. Remember to always leave space between you and the next car as locals seem to have no issue with pinning you in if you don't. \n\nCat was great about communicating with us. She seemed available at all times, promptly answering any questions that we had.\n\nEric\nVancouver, WA \nUSA"},{"_id":"124881102","date":{"$date":"2017-01-02T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10423504","reviewer_id":"56832913","reviewer_name":"Lorraine","comments":"This accommodation is in a lovely location, quiet close to the beach.

Perfect for early morning walks to see the sunrise at Bondi Beach. The space is large and the main house shower was spectacular. The bedrooms and living space are large. The small touches were nice - there was coffee available which was huge, and the hair dryer available worked really well (long haired Airbnbers know how important this is)! \n\nCat was an amazing host, and was extremely responsive. The outdoor spade was lovely and the fish are a great touch. As someone who isn’t used to seeing bugs often, the amount of bugs we saw was a bit alarming, but Cat took care of this right away!"},{"_id":"241886862","date":{"$date":"2018-03-10T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10423504","reviewer_id":"41789294","reviewer_name":"Theresa","comments":"Lovely place, great location.

Cat's place is a private oasis in  the heart of beach-chic Bondi, only three quaint blocks to the sand (which my four-year-old insisted on completing barefoot like the locals).  It's as hip as Brooklyn but with better weather than Los Angeles and a fraction of the people,  Everything you could want is in the kitchen, and many thoughtful extras in the bathroom.  We enjoyed reading on the front porch and dining al fresco in the garden. Cat was a responsive super helpful hostess with a nice vibe in keeping with the Bondi lifestyle.

It was the best experience ever.  Cat is an extremely gracious hostess.  Very friendly, great communication and really thoughtful, unexpectedly offering us early check in and late check out because it was possible. \n\nThe house has a lovely friendly feel to it, and is as amazing as the pictures look, they are accurate.   Loved sitting in the beautiful courtyard, sipping champagne and enjoying the fish.\n\nSo many small attentions to detail.... having champagne stoppers, insect repellant and a really helpful guide to the house and how to navigate the surrounding areas. Lovely toiletries and an amazing open fire - yes I had the fire going, not because it was really cold, but because I love an open fire and this was one of the reasons I chose the property.  Cat was very accommodating with this and we had plenty of firewood. The fire burnt and drew well.\n\nGreat location. The house is a very easy walk to Bondi Beach, even for unfit me, and an even shorter walk to groceries, bottle shop, cafe and restaurants.\n\nParking is the only thing that is a bit awkward.  The listing description is accurate in this regard.  If you have a regular size car you will not be able to get into the driveway, which is such a shame.  We were able to get longer stay parking in other streets, but this obviously wasn't as convenient. It was doable though.\n\nWe thoroughly enjoyed our stay and intend to stay there again."},{"_id":"253583288","date":{"$date":"2018-04-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10423504","reviewer_id":"23043423","reviewer_name":"Stefana","comments":"Stayed for a hens weekend, very central location and access to everything in Bondi.

The host there was unaffected with our concerns. All of which were half heartedly addressed, if at all.  The house at the rocks where we stayed had a terrible mold problem.

We were able to see many sights and surrounding towns, yet get in beautiful beach time. The building and condo is well maintained, and the grounds are landscaped very nicely.  The sound of the ocean and the palm trees at night in the bedroom made for a relaxing way to fall asleep. There are all the needed beach necessities and the kitchen is well appointed. We also enjoyed listening to the Hawaiian Cd's that were available in the apartment. It was a good introduction to the Slack Key style and added to the ambiance.   \r\n\r\nDon't forget to take a walk to the farmer's market and Sugar Beach Bake shop.

Loved the location, so convenient to all parts of the island.  Gage was quick to respond to our inquiries.  The condo management were very nice and everyone staying there was very friendly.  Grounds are well kept.  My daughter loved playing in the pool with other children.  We enjoyed having a washer and dryer in the unit.  During the day when we were there, we just left windows and door open because the cross breeze was so nice. Many others did the same. The ocean waters on this side of the island are calm, especially in the morning.  So we enjoyed swimming and riding the waves during the day.  We loved morning walks along the beach and watching the sunset. The beach was not crowded and we really appreciated the beach chairs and beach towels provided by owners. We also appreciated the designated parking space. Condo had everything we needed for a wonderful Maui vacation.  We highly recommend this budget friendly rental. I would rather stay here than a high priced hotel condo."},{"_id":"260721189","date":{"$date":"2018-05-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1042446","reviewer_id":"22373489","reviewer_name":"Ela","comments":"Awesome place - great view, great location, very clean, strong A/C, free parking spot.

Also crystal had informed us that she wont be around during a certain time a few days earlier but we'd left for macau/hong kong just a day before she sent us a email, which made things worse, as none of us had bought the local sim card and i didnt check my email. And since we didnt know which flat she was stayign in, we couldnt even tell the guards there, for them to allow us go up. when we asked the guard if there was wifi at the lobby, sadly there was none so we couldnt get into airbnb. so we had to get the local sim card and connect to the internet so i could check my email. thank god her husband mike, left his contact number and flat number via email. basically the timing was so wrong. cant entirely blame it on crystal.  otherwise everything was good. the space was a bit small, location is walking distance from Mongkok East station. So that was really good for moving around. Hardly got to meet crystal but her husband mike was always around  in the evenings. so, he gave us quite a tip to take a cab to go to the airport rather than taking the MTR especially if you have luggage. \r\n\r\nmain tip: take the train to mongkok east, and check your email/airbnb a day before and on the day of arrival in hong kong for updates your host has left for you.

The hosts were lovely and really got us out of a pickle with speedy replies and instant book even though it was late."},{"_id":"75217066","date":{"$date":"2016-05-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10458796","reviewer_id":"66228813","reviewer_name":"Soonsoon","comments":"房间很干净,房东人也很棒,周围食肆选择也多,哈哈,很开心的一次体验"},{"_id":"75644658","date":{"$date":"2016-05-22T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10458796","reviewer_id":"48488660","reviewer_name":"Bo","comments":"Nice host"},{"_id":"76132127","date":{"$date":"2016-05-25T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10458796","reviewer_id":"69133484","reviewer_name":"Lauren","comments":"房东非常nice,对我们的疑问有问必答｡屋子很干净,床的大小适合两个人住｡小宝宝很乖,房间的隔音效果不错,虽然宝宝偶尔有哭,但是在房间里也不会听到｡希望有机会再来,祝小BB健康成长"},{"_id":"76268177","date":{"$date":"2016-05-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10458796","reviewer_id":"28032888","reviewer_name":"何","comments":"第一次用airbnb就遇到一對喜歡旅遊的房東,所以我始終相信那些心在路上的人是最具包容度的,房間準備的各品牌打折卡,交通逛街很方便､房東寶寶很可愛,眼藥水掉在他家裡還提醒我,下次有機會大家再選擇他們家｡"},{"_id":"76574142","date":{"$date":"2016-05-28T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10458796","reviewer_id":"70607835","reviewer_name":"Aileen","comments":"房东夫妻非常友善热情,公寓5楼的健身房很高档,可以游泳,也有跑步机可以跑步｡｡附近购物非常方便｡｡ "},{"_id":"78431704","date":{"$date":"2016-06-06T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10458796","reviewer_id":"8428310","reviewer_name":"David","comments":"In the heart of Mongkok - a very busy and densely populated area. The hosts were shy and helpful. I stayed for 10 nights with the majority of my time out, and tippy toeing back in anywhere between midnight and 5am! The room itself is small, but very typical of Hong Kong with air con (a must in humidity of 80%). \r\nThe block in which the tower is in is clearly very well looked after and very classy - it even has a gym and swimming pool on the 5th floor which I used once. \r\nWhen I stayed they had a newborn baby, which I have to say didn't have the lungs or the crying capacity to make any noise whatsoever. It was more silent than me. \r\n\r\nI didn't make much use of the flat as a whole, but stayed mostly in my room. Have to say, I really liked the husband as did my friend. Really decent guy - just hospitable and someone you can see yourself going out with. Top people and exactly what this website is about.

The most important thing is that everything was clean and we rest 100% in the room provided. The only thing we are disappointed with is that we couldn't have a chat with them and it could have been a great help for our visit in Hong Kong giving us some tips about the city.

Why I'd recommend you stay:\r\n\r\n* Lots of privacy, with your own entrance...\r\n\r\n* Cath is a very generous, understanding, and thoughtful host, and easy to contact. We particularly loved her guides about where to eat in the local area.\r\n\r\n* TGS is very well located in the central suburb of Marrickville - easy to get into the CBD/Newtown/Surry Hills, and if you drive like me, never any complications with street parking!\r\n\r\n* The studio was meticulous, and very well stocked - Cath filled the fridge/kitchen with nearly everything you'd need... The variety of teas and delicious homemade cookies were mostly appreciated, and I'm sure most Airbnb users are interested in an espresso machine, which was also available!\r\n\r\n* The shower in this place is truly amazing.\r\n\r\nAll in all, if you don't mind a smaller place, this is the place for you - we found it worked well for 2 people.

Such warmth and sincere hospitality. Handed a loaf of baked bread straight from the oven within moments was an unexpected delight. The beautifully styled and thoughtfully prepared space is ideal. We felt that the attention to detail was the best we have experienced using AirBNB. From the generously stocked fridge and hamper, bathroom items, games, videos and books and even picnic gear it was clear the stylish owner is well travelled and knows how to make a space a temporary home. The kitchenette has everything you need. In fact the space and the lovely courtyard was so delightful we surprised ourselves by spending the first morning there enjoying a lazy breakfast reading the terrific range of wonderful magazines rather than head out. The location is great. At the end of the street is a lovely park where we were able to fit in a morning run. Very comfy bed, quality linen, a super quiet fan. Great information and maps were a welcome addition. We would love to return here and most likely will. Highly recommended.

Everything is done to a really high quality level, from the sheets on the perfectly made bed to the spotless interior and the fantastic breakfast box Cath left for me.  The garden is a wonderful and quiet place to hang out, although it is definitely shared between you and the host.  Privacy feels more private that a room in someone else's house, but probably less than a stand-alone apartment - reasonable since it's a studio in someone's back garden.  The neighborhood is quiet and pretty, with nice cafes and a farmer's market a 15-minute walk.  Getting into and out of other places in the city takes a while; you are not in the center of things, but in a nice neighborhood.  A car or a bike would be more flexible than using transit.

We could walk to more in the area than we even managed to do in the 3 days we were there (so there is no shortage of great food or entertainment).

The studio is just like it is shown in the pics being even better than a hotel stay. It is fully equipped with everything you need and it has everything as described on the Airbnb site. We were blown away with the fresh and tasty eggs Cath provided us from her own chickens on site. Her breakfast hamper has fresh bread, yogurt, muesli, milk and other baked goods that was more than what we needed. Cath is very thoughtful and considerate of her guests and will provide you all the information required to travel, eat and be like a local which is what we wanted to do in our Sydney stay. We also loved her sense of style and the way she has done up the Garden studio. Also there is a lovely vegetable patch with herbs and greens right outside the studio. Very pretty.  The little details matter like the umbrellas, picnic basket, extra blankets, etc that were provided to us. The studio is not located within the CBD area but that was not a problem at all since we were commuting around via trains and buses and did not find any issues doing so. Also it is in a suburb very close to the central area so you are still pretty close. Besides Marickville has some of the best food and coffee options that we explored in our trip. Stay at the Garden studio and you will not be disappointed. We were sad to leave and only wished we could have stayed longer. This has surely been our best AirBnb stay till date. \r\n\r\nP.S. Just make sure you are okay to stay in a loft like bed with a movable ladder to climb up and down which may not suit everyone. That was a highlight for us though and we wanted to experience it :) "},{"_id":"52111224","date":{"$date":"2015-10-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1047087","reviewer_id":"23237182","reviewer_name":"Brittany","comments":"We had an amazing stay in Cath's studio.

Very nice and lovely! a little treasury :)\n\nCath is very attentive, helpful and extremely pleasant. She was always reachable when we asked for insider tips or had questions concerning locations to visit. The \"cherry on top of the cake\" was that Cath brought us to the airport on our last day! Thanks again!\n\nSo for us it is not difficult to summarize that Cath (and her husband mark) are excellent \"super hosts\"! We loved the week in Marrickville and enjoyed the stay in the Garden Studio. Highly recommended!!! :)\n\nCath and Mark: Thank you very very much for being your guests!

(great walking distance for all the events), Easily accessible to subway, tram, ferries. The neighbourhood is friendly and diverse. It is only 3 minutes by walk to the Galatasaray Square which is located approximately at the center of the Istiklal Avenue. Istiklal Avenue is located in the historic Beyoğlu (Pera) district, it is an elegant pedestrian street, 1.4 kilometers long, which houses boutiques, music stores, bookstores, art galleries, cinemas, theatres, libraries, cafés, pubs, night clubs with live music, historical patisseries, chocolateries and restaurants.  You should definately walk through the local bazaar on Sunday right beside the apartment. You can find anything you need with cheap prices; fruits, vegetables, nuts, fish, meat, dairy products! Local bazaars will be very helpful to understand the culture of Turkish people as well.

As you may be unfamiliar with the area, I am happy to come and pick you up in front of Galatasaray Highschool (on Istiklal Street) which is 10 minutes walk from Taksim Square where you will get off. I can always advise you cheaper public transport options if you ask for. Useful information: You can rent the apartment/room for (a) day(s), week, month or longer periods of time.  There is various supermarkets conveniently situated a block away from the apartment on the way to Istiklal street, also a small kiosk right next to the apartment and a laundry in 100 meters distance.","transit":"Getting around by Walk, Subway, Bus, Tram, Ferry, Tunnel: You can take one of the world's oldest tram on Istiklal street by 3 minutes walk from the apartment on Istiklal street. By tram you can end up in Istanbul’s Tunnel (Tünel) which is the world’s shortest and third-oldest passenger terminal. This one-stop funicular climbs the steeply uphill for 500 meters from Karaköy to Tünel and the other way around. Karaköy is today a major transport hub for intercity and also a house of unique cafes and galleries. We can count Karaköy for the city's recent hip?? district. The Galata Bridge connects Karaköy with the Old City, on which the fast tram line Zeytinburnu-Kabataş runs with. This tram line goes to Atatürk Airport within 1 hour. Ferry boats run every 10 to 20 minutes from the ferry terminal on a pontoon to Haydarpaşa train terminal and Kadıköy across the Asian shore of Bosphorus.

The apartment was clean, nicely decorated, and stocked with the necessities. The location perfect. You're right in the heart of a lively area and can walk to plenty of action (restaurants, attractions, bars, shopsetc) in 5-20 minutes. There is also a great 24 hour local restaurant directly across the street from the apartment. Aybike was quick to respond to any questions and provided very valuable recommendations. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for an authentic Istanbul experience."},{"_id":"234534550","date":{"$date":"2018-02-13T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10486984","reviewer_id":"89960099","reviewer_name":"Rahmatullah","comments":"Comfortable beds in bedrooms, modern showers, and accessories, accessible location to all public transport and major tourist hubs.

I might have expected her house to be slightly more than what I imagined from the pictures but it was comfortable and equipped nevertheless. So that wasn’t a big deal. The location of the house is very close to the busy İstiklal street and the bus stop ‘Ömer Hayyam’ has frequent connectivity to ‘Taksim Square’ and Ominonu. The only downside we felt was we had to climb stairs to reach the bus stop and it was not fun to do so with a stroller to carry around. But without a stroller I’d not have worried about this situation. Our 5 day stay was comfortable expect the continuous rain dampened spirit a bit.

А также высокий шум с улицы, который не прекращается даже ночью. Шум, преимущественно, исходит от лежачего полицейского, который устроен в виде больших граблей, расположенных таким образом, чтобы машины могли ехать только в одном направлении. Улица, на которую выходят окна квартиры, с односторонним движением и грабли срабатывают с изящным скрежетом каждый раз, когда на лежачий полицейский наезжают колеса автотранспорта. \n\u0009В остальном хозяйка сделала все возможное для нашего комфортного проживания.

O condominio é bem grande, fica na frente da praia mas tem uma pequena caminhada dentro dele pra chegar até a saída. Nada longo se vc não estiver carregando muita coisa. A comunicação com a Paula foi maravilhosa. Ela sempre respondeu tudo muito rápido e o acesso ao apartamento foi tranquilo. O fato de ter um cofre na porta de entrada ajuda muito se vc estiver viajando com outras pessoas. Assim a chave fica sempre guardada lá para caso as pessoas cheguem separadas no apto. Muito funcional.\nA única coisa que eu sugeri pra Paula é ter toalhas. Chegamos lá e não encontramos toalhas. Apenas roupas de cama. Mesmo o anuncio dizendo que o apartamento não tinha, essa informação fica um pouco escondida em \"básicos\". Só percebi que \"básico\" era toalhas, roupa de cama e sabonetes depois que cheguei. Isso atrapalhou um pouco.

A great tip is to buy a 7 day metro pass for about $30 which will get to anywhere by underground or bus.

This could make some issues irrelevant for people who intend to stay for a few days to 1 week. \n\nHost:\nGuillermo is a very considerate host and genuinely wants guests to have a great stay. His communications are very quick and he is also very quick in responding to any issues. He is a really nice guy and trustworthy. He personally responds to issues and even got us a microwave oven on request, which was very kind of him. \n\nNoise:\nOne issue we had with the apartment is noise. This is obviously nothing to do with the host but it can't really be ignored in a review. There is a cement factory right behind the apartment and a welders/metal works opposite it. This is going to make noise. Both start work very early in the morning so we often were woke up by the beeping of trucks reversing and the grinding of the metal works across the road. They both work 6 days a week. Probably not an issue for a few days but having that noise every morning for a month is annoying. \n\nArea:\nThe area (Bushwick) is very different to Williamsburg even though some people call it East Williamsburg. Bushwick is more like real life. Good variety of people and cultures and we found it very safe. Plenty of amenities close by. Getting into Manhattan is very simple. L train is 5 stops away from East Village which is great. Bushwick has artists' residence and an amazing Pizza place called Roberta's, which is a must. There is very impressive street art (lots of it) about 5 minutes away. \n\nRooms:\nThe bathroom is new and everything works well. Kitchen is ok but a little limited. We did have some issues with the power going a couple of times in there. It does need re-wiring. The Lounge is nice. TV has Netflix and the Air Con is pretty good and keeps the apartment cool. WiFi is quick. The bed was comfortable. The Furniture is pretty good. Sofa is comfortable and fairly new and it has a good desk and a place to hang clothes. \n\nCleanliness:\nIn addition to the surrounding noise, the only other issue we had was the cleanliness of the apartment. It looks pretty clean when you arrive but the floor left your feet dirty if you walked around barefoot and when you inspected a little closer (behind sofa or fridge) it was pretty dirty. there is a collection of thick dust in-between the bars of the radiators and there was a strange smell by the bed, which we couldn't work out what it was? Bathroom was very clean. It is an old building/apartment and needs a little TLC in terms of the flooring."},{"_id":"182028746","date":{"$date":"2017-08-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10545815","reviewer_id":"5042213","reviewer_name":"María Soledad","comments":"We had a great stay at Guillermo's apartment.

The apartment is not in the heart of Williamsburg, more on the outskirts but it’s only 5 mins into Williamsburg and 15 into Manhattan on the subway (the nearest station is a few minutes walk). \n\nThe area looks a little shady when you first arrive but we had no issues at all. There is a pizza place and other takeouts, grocery stores and a couple bars all near the subway station.\n\nGuillermo was very responsive and provided us with all the info we needed in plenty of time. He also gave us phone numbers in case we needed them.\n\nThe apartment is lovely and spacious and the bathroom and kitchen were spotless. It was freezing when we visited and the apartment was always lovely and warm. The only notes I would make is that the blinds in the apartment aren’t very thick so if you are a light sleeper you may want to take a sleep mask. Also, there isn’t really any storage space for you clothes. It’s fine if you’re there for a week (like is) but might be a bit of an issue for people staying longer.\n\nAll in all it is a great base to explore the city and I would definitely stay again on my next trip to New York."},{"_id":"362961850","date":{"$date":"2018-12-27T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10545815","reviewer_id":"32466225","reviewer_name":"Daniel","comments":"Great place, would recommend this place if you want to see new part of NY.

We found that the A/C in the bedrooms upstairs were kind of loud as it shut off and on through the night.  And the house rule of running it at a 75 degree minimum still seemed warm to us.  But it was still better than nothing, since we didn't want to keep all the bedroom doors open all night to catch the cross breezes (for privacy and to manage the snorers).\nOverall, I would easily recommend this place!

Loved the wraparound lanai, especially with the lovely view of the ocean.  We cooked most of our meals at the house so it was convenient and helped us save a ton of money.  We also enjoyed eating out at the restaurants suggested by Nate (we loved Lava Java).  The house is fully equipped with beach equipment/toys which we didn't really use (we brought our own) but know that it's there.  Easy access to town and highway.  Overall highly recommend this home and cannot wait to visit the Big Island again and will definitely want to stay here again."},{"_id":"184012210","date":{"$date":"2017-08-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10548991","reviewer_id":"142647618","reviewer_name":"Cindy","comments":"Jubilee by the Sea is definitely a nice place to stay.

It's beautiful, clean, close to everything, and has a wonderful view. We went to Kona for a family wedding and it was great to have a big house together as opposed to several hotel rooms. In the mornings we had coffee on the lanai while we looked out at the ocean--so lovely! Nate was a wonderful host. He got back to us right away each time we needed something. We did wish for AC window units in the downstairs bedrooms like the ones upstairs. But we were there in August, the hottest time of the year. It probably wouldn't be a big deal to go without AC most of the year. There is usually a nice ocean breeze. Overall, it's a wonderful place and we would definitely recommend it! :)"},{"_id":"204524694","date":{"$date":"2017-10-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10548991","reviewer_id":"75588117","reviewer_name":"Donna","comments":"Nates place is a great location, 5 minute drive to the beach.

Much laughter was had at his home and much loved was shared with our family, from renewal of wedding vows for my husband and I, 1 year anniversary for my daughter and her husband and my husband finishing the Iron Worlds 2017.

We didn’t have a lot of breeze when we opened up the windows but that’s probably unusual.  There was an upstairs and downstairs living space and refrigerator.\n\nAmenities offered included beach chairs which was great for us - these were to be shared with another property.  We didn’t notice any beach towels but perhaps we didn’t look hard enough since we had our own.  \n\nI admit that I did not realize that only the upstairs living room and bedrooms had AC units, but it was written in the description so I do not fault the host for this - some of our party were very hot downstairs so they just stayed upstairs.  Washer and dryer were on premises but locked up unless asked for - we did have to buy our own laundry detergent.\n\nAll in all, the description was accurate regarding the home.

First of all, the following guests should know that the pretty view on the pictures is not seen from inside the apartment - not of the windows, no out of the terrace either. That was a big letdown for us. You can see the view only from outside of the building and that's quite confusing. Second, you should know that the mouldy smell on the bedding and the big bedroom are unbearable. Me and my husband couldn't sleep there, it was awful. Fortunately we manage to arrange that problem and sleep in the dining room on the couch that become a bed. The main problem in Regina's apartment is the mouldy smell that she explained is due to the location of the apartment. In spite of all that, Regina was very helpful host. She let us leave our luggage at their family hotel on chek-out day because we had 4 hours to spare before going to the airport. We had a great time mainly on the terrace which is right next to the kitchen. The neighborhood was great - quiet, there is a big market and bus stops very close by. Very easy to get to the city center and even the night buses stopped very close. Bunkers de can Baro are very close to the apartment - 1o min. walk up on the hill. They were spectacular.

I know shampoo is not that big of a deal but I specifically did not buy it because it says that we would have some at the apartment.\n\nNO WINE OPENER either. I also messaged her about it and she was sure that it was in the kitchen but then I looked back in some of the reviews and found a couple of them that says they couldn’t find it either. It seems like she doesn’t really know her own listing that well. \n\nWe never actually met Alexandra and checked in with her friend, Anastasia. She checked us in right at 2 pm and was  nice. \n\nThe apartment itself was clean and the couch is actually better than the one in the pictures but some of the decorations were different. No biggie though. \n\nThe only thing about the apartment is there is ONLY ONE FAN. There are 2 bedrooms and 3 sleeping areas but we shared one fan which was impossible.

We needed an apartment during carnival and this was perfect. Good bed, bedroom had good AC. Two bathrooms. Big kitchen with huge fridge. Very big balcony. Nice common swimming pool. The neighborhood was even nicer than expected. Right next to the Jardim Botanico, many restaurants in this street and in the Rua Pacheco Leao. The Zona Sul, an upmarket supermarket indeed around the corner (corner Rua Jardim Botanico and Rua Pacheco Leao). We very much liked La Biciclette for breakfast, it is a French bakery on the corner of Rua Pacheco Leao and Rua Von Martius. Also we liked the restaurant SOBE in the Rua Pacheco Leao. Good starters, great view on the Christ as it is partly an open-air restaurant. Roberta and her sister were very nice for us."},{"_id":"64130564","date":{"$date":"2016-02-29T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10570041","reviewer_id":"9094470","reviewer_name":"Nubia","comments":"  Roberta muito atenciosa,  disponível, tranquila e sensata, aceita conselhos, e isso para mim conta muito...Apartamento super confortável no Jardim Botânico que eu amo, e a posição do apartamento é maravilhoso, tem o que precisamos dentro de uma casa... rua  tranquila. perto de tudo.

The apartment is cute and stocked with everything you need to actually live in it, which I appreciated - good kitchen. Roberta was responsive and accessible. If you're visiting Rio, it's a great base, in a lovely neighbourhood. Two things to keep in mind - it's really quite a small space (standard for Rio, but perhaps a surprise for guests who arrive from outside Brazil) and you hear a lot of street noise, so it's perhaps not ideal for light sleepers. We would stay here again!"},{"_id":"337139594","date":{"$date":"2018-10-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10570041","reviewer_id":"16183107","reviewer_name":"Antonio","comments":"O apartamento entrega tudo aquilo que promete embora seja um pouco barulhento por conta do ônibus que passa na porta.
