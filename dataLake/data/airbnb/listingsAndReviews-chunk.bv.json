Morgan's mom who was visiting, was also sweet, and so very pleasant to be around. \r\n\r\nI didn't meet Nico until I returned two weeks later to pick up my two large suitcases, which Nico and his housemates have kindly allowed me to store in the apartment. While I needed only the basics: good sleep, hot water for coffee, hot shower, central location -- from my quick chat with Nico, I get the sense that he's the kind of host I would like to have when in a new city.

Best of all, the internet connection was quite stable.  Renate went out of her way to help us, including printing out for us some tickets to visit the Christ statue.

Renata is so knowledgeable about Rio, and about so many other things, she can send you to those precious secret eateries, and off the beaten track hidden gems you just need to ask. She is bilingual in English which is consequential for those of you who have no time to learn Portuguese. Her flat is so intelligently done, so functional, perfectly equipped and pretty in what is the best part of Leblon which itself is the best part of Rio every thing is 2mn walk away and a supermarket is right in front. I hope she will not raise prices like she should haha. It is really the best find in its category in Rio pure and simple so consider yourself lucky if you catch it !"},{"_id":"52247748","date":{"$date":"2015-10-27T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"490098","reviewer_id":"9897072","reviewer_name":"Luciana","comments":"Pasamos unos días increíbles en Rio.

Very secure, has a porter in the building  during the day as well and so super close to the beach. It looked very pretty in the pictures and it was even better when I arrived. Modern and vintage chic combo! Beautifully decorated. It even has a cute mini bar! \r\nRenata was a joy to deal with, got all my pre-trip questions answered, info provided and details explained. She's only round the corner so I could always drop her a message if I needed something. I was also able to check in earlier (I arrived in the morning), which was really helpful.\r\nI've been in Rio before but Renata had lots of useful tips/maps of Rio and general advice.\r\nLeblon is the best place to stay in Rio if you want nice neighbourhood, beach, cute shops and restaurants, juice bars and above all, not too touristy. It's like Soho in New York and Chelsea in London.\r\n\r\nReally highly recommended!

Getting there from the airport by taxi is easy and also going around in Rio catching a taxi infront of the building is safe. We loved the breakfast at Talho Capixaba and the Acai at Balada Mix!

Upon arrival, he showed us around the apartment and left us with the keys.\r\n\r\nThe description of this property, \"Best location in Leblon\" could not have been more accurate.  It was less than a 5 minute walk from the closest metro station, Antero de Quental, on the new Line 4.  This station is only a few stops from General Osorio station in Ipanema.  The area was lively and felt safe.\r\n\r\nThere were tons of restaurants and two shopping malls very near to the property.  All of our best meals came from Renata's recommendations, so I highly recommend taking a look at those. \r\n\r\nWould definitely stay here again and recommend this property!

A sala com poeira e lixo atrás da almofadas. O ar condicionado é de janela que normalmente faz barulho e está  fixado na janela o que piora o barulho, faz a janela tremer e dificulta o sono.

The first day Sonia provided us with maps, suggestions to great restaurants,sights, etc and Ernesto was even kind enough to lug my baby sister's luggage up 5 flights of stairs.

We got a clear sight of the activities on Manly Beach, even Shelley Beach, surfers riding the waves, sail boats anchored in sea, kayaks out in sea, I could even spot my young daughter on the beach from the apartment! The view should enough reason to choose Jarmo's apartment!\n\nCorso, which is the main strip of shops, is just a short skip away. The farmers' (Wednesday) and craft (weekends) markets are just outside the building. A 24/7 convenience store is just round the corner. Being so central, it gave us the opportunity to try different restaurants, cafes, little coffee shops around the area every meal.\n\nIt was an easy stroll to Manly Wharf, too, to catch the Manly Ferries to Sydney. On our last trip to Sydney, my husband left his Opal card with just under 20 mins to catch the next ferry. He made it to the apartment and back to catch that ferry. \n\nJarmo strongly recommended we use the Manly Ferries and we could now understand why. The slower pace of the Manly Ferries allow us to enjoy the view of the Sydney Harbour and its surrounding area, Watson Bay and North Head (which you could see from the apartment) each time we took the ferry.\n\nJarmo was thoughtful to provide all our necessary toiletries, washing and laundry detergents, milk, tea and coffee (with coffee machine!) in the apartment. There were even umbrellas for the rainy days! \n\nJarmo is also very helpful. He answered my non-stop numerous questions about the apartment and Manly. He inquired about the fare for the airport shuttle bus for me, gave suggestions on the tours and gave me recommendations on things-to-do on Sydney and Manly etc. He is definitely a Superhost!"},{"_id":"70381273","date":{"$date":"2016-04-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4919014","reviewer_id":"16327009","reviewer_name":"Christine","comments":"Jarmo met my husband and I and showed us around the apartment.

Not only is the host easy to access, the studio apartment is decked out with every detail needed to make staying in Sydney effortless.  Being someone from the U.S. Jarmo has thought of everything to make sure you know to get around on the Ferry's and can get a hold of them if you need anything at all!  We stay in Sydney every year and this is by far the best spot - it is so peaceful, serene and relaxing, what more could you ask for!   The home is spacious and I literally can't think of a single thing that could have been done better - this place has everything!   5 stars and if you are thinking of staying in Manly look no further as you won't find a better place or a better host!

However, do not expect what the photos portray for the inside of the apartment. It is extremely outdated and needs a major renovation. The towels are very dingy and we had issues with the hot water not working in the shower. That being said, any issue we brought upon the front reception they were very responsive. In fact, the reason I am giving 3 stars is solely based upon how amazing the front staff was as they were considerate to the fact that we were three women traveling alone. They went out of the way to help us with even the smallest of tasks (thank you again for the birthday gift!) and we felt safe that there was a 24/7 reception. Also, you can't beat the location - it is walking distance to several cafes and shops. This apartment has a lot of potentials to be better regarding cleanliness and the outdated atmosphere. Since we were on the top floor the generator made a lot of noise which will bother light sleepers (such as my mom) but some soundproof windows can solve this issue!

Let's start with the fact that the view from this room/suite is fantastic. I don't have a basis for comparison, but I was wary of hotel rooms that claimed a view because I didn't know how good the views were. The pictures on the listing are actual pictures from the room. I spent a lot of time just looking out the windows.\n\nAlso positive was the attitude of the staff.  They were very friendly and helpful. One man walked me to a nearby supermarket to show me, another started breakfast a bit early for me, and they were all responsive in every way. \n\nBreakfast is fantastic, given that this is a small hotel, not a big multi-star place. You get a large plate of cheese, bread, fruits, yogurt, a boiled egg, some meat, honey, butter, jam. There is also coffee and tea and cold cereal and so on. It's a simple place, but they do a very nice job on breakfast.\n\nThe location is outstanding, too. It is at the bottom end of a steep tourist street very near the main bridge connecting the two old parts of Istanbul. You can walk to the Metro/tram in a few minutes and even walk across the bridge to the Hagia Sophia or Sultanahmet mosque (Blue Mosque). The Galata Tower is just a hundred meters or so just up the very steep street.\n\nI loved the place, other than the fact that the living room furniture was sparse and quite stained. The bathroom is very high quality, you get a fridge and a sink and a microwave, and the bedroom is very nice. I am planning to go to Istanbul again in the next few weeks and the only reason I wouldn't stay there is because I might want to try a different neighborhood next time."},{"_id":"307792177","date":{"$date":"2018-08-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4940063","reviewer_id":"66614019","reviewer_name":"Adam","comments":"Perfect location with an amazing view. one thing to keep in mind was that because the location was so central there was quite a bit of noise from the road.

Sasha helped us get fast seating as a popular local eater, willingly toured us around central park and other areas, and all around exceeded our expectations. He helped with directions and recommendations as this was our first time really touring the city. The neighborhood is fantastic and there are dogs EVERYWHERE! We were in puppy heaven (we always miss our dogs when on vacation). It is also very conveniently placed by the 1 line. :-) All around we plan to definitely use Sasha again next time we are in the city.

I moved to NYC and stayed with her for over a month and a half while I was figuring out permanent housing. She provided the most hospitable situation I have ever encountered anywhere. She treats you like you are staying at a close family members house and goes above and beyond to make you feel comfortable. Fun conversations, movie nights, and dinners were just some of the highlights of the stay. Staying here is good for introverts and extroverts because you have the space and quiet you need but also the social interactions. I’m honestly honored to have met such a great person and I now consider Rivka an actual friend even after I left her house! "}]}

And, most important, there is a bodega with tons of great organic staples for cooking and a wine shop down the block. I lived in Fort Greene for 8 years, and I still can't believe how quiet her apartment is, so it is the perfect place to rest if you are out sightseeing all day (also really close to buses and trains) or, if you need to get work done, like me. I am a PhD student with a young child at home and needed a comfy and quiet place near great food options to work on writing my dissertation. Amy's apartment was perfect! I worked straight for 8 days at her amazing long wood table with a row of windows of light pouring in. And, after these long days of work, I cooked in Amy's beautiful kitchen and slept in the most comfy bed ever! \r\n\r\nThis was my first time using Airbnb, and I didn't know what to expect or how everything would work. Amy was really great, and her son Yasha who lives downstairs was sweet and helpful if I needed anything. When I submitted my reservation request, Amy responded within an hour and answered all of my questions, and we talked on the phone the next day to solidify things. She was there to greet me when I checked in (with coffee and tea and fresh baked bread and chocolate!!) and met my husband and son who were dropping me off for my retreat. Everything went so smoothly, so great in fact that I have already booked her place for another writing retreat in March. \r\n\r\nI absolutely recommend Amy's place for work or holiday or maybe even if you just need a night to yourself.

A wonderful stay from start to finish. I was greeted warmly with hot tea, a delicious pastry, and more information about the neighborhood than I could hope to explore during my short stay. Amy was particularly accommodating to my cooking needs; the kitchen is equipped with just about anything you could imagine needing, and I was directed to all of the local markets in the neighborhood. \r\n\r\nAs for the place itself, it's very secure and safe. So much so that I accidentally locked myself out on the first night (the door to the foyer locks automatically, so don't forget your keys! ;)  Amy, however, was quick to come to the rescue and saved me from the cold. Inside, you'll find that though the photos are wonderful, they don't do justice to the apartment. It's more spacious than you would imagine, and the lighting is fantastic. I only wish I could come back in the warmer months to make use of the lovely patio out back. Plenty of natural light coming in the back windows (not by the bed) making the kitchen area perfect for cooking breakfast, reading, or even rolling your mat out and doing a little yoga; the large mirror is perfect for checking your alignment :)\r\n\r\nThe washer and dryer are in great shape if you need to do laundry, and there's space in the bathroom and closets for all of your things. \r\n\r\nSimply put, it doesn't get much better than Amy's. If you're looking for a place that's not overly busy itself, with easy access to the more bustling parts of Brooklyn, this is the place.

Additionally, Amy ensured that some light was left on and the heat as on so that we were comfortable and not stumbling in the dark when we arrived. \r\n\r\nThe ONLY problem with the loft was the noise. We could hear EVERYTHING going on out on the street. Additionally we could hear the people in the apartment upstairs both going up and down the stairs and walking around in their apartment. Additionally, being an old building, we could hear thee water running in the walls from the heater, which we were not used to since neither of us have lived somewhere like that. However, the noise did not prevent us from sleeping. \r\n\r\nThe neighborhood is very quiet and everyone we encountered was very nice. However, there is not a ton of stuff to do around the area, other than a couple of restaurants and some small convenience stores. So, we did have to travel kind of far into Manhattan or to the more poppin areas of Brooklyn, but there is a subway stop about a 10 minute walk from the apartment so it was no problem getting around. \r\n\r\nOverall we had a great time and the apartment was a lovely place to stay!"},{"_id":"125401475","date":{"$date":"2017-01-05T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4957358","reviewer_id":"45051810","reviewer_name":"Silas","comments":"Amy's place was great.

Hon hörde av sig mycket frekvent innan resan när vi ställde frågor och hörde av sig varje dag under vår vistelse där för att se om vi behövde något och om allt var bra. Hon pratade med flygbolaget när vårt bagage försvann och tog emot bagaget på eget initiativ när det kom två dygn efter att vi kommit fram. Hon var behjälplig i alla lägen och var extremt lättillgänglig. Lägenheten var fantastiskt fin och välvårdad och det var rent och snyggt. Lägenheten  har en jättefin liten uteplats som vi satt på morgon och kväll när vi hade chansen. Allt vi behövde fanns och hon hade gjort plats för våra saker i garderober såväl som i badrummet. Vi kunde inte vara mer nöjda med vår vistelse i lägenheten och vi vill väldigt gärna komma tillbaka om vi besöker New York city och Brooklyn igen. Vi rekommenderar varmt Amy's lägenhet för vem som helst som vill åka till New York och bo i Brooklyn. Området var otroligt mysigt och människorna var varma och hjälpsamma. Vi saknade inte något under vår vistelse i Amy's fina lägenhet!   \n\nAmy was a fabulous hostess!!! She was responsive before our stay as well as during our stay when she checked in with us every day to make sure everything was great during our stay. She gave us useful tips and even arranged to meet up with the driver who delivered our lost luggage when the airline called her as they wouldn't call our Swedish number. The apartment is beautiful and we felt very at home there and we loved the little patio where we spent time when we had time in the mornings and evenings. She had made room for our things in the closet and in the bathroom. We will definitely try to stay there again when we visit Brooklyn next time! We would recommend Amy's place to anyone who wants to spend time in Brooklyn while in New York!! All in all this was an amazing stay and we loved the neighborhood too, everyone was incredibly friendly and helpful whenever we had questions or just chatted with people. We didn't miss a single thing hospitality wise during our stay!

I have never seen nor spoken to Pablo directly, so it is difficult for me to write this review. I intended not to write a comment, but if I had known about the downsides of staying at this property, I would have stayed somewhere else. I noticed Pablo’s mother was highly emotional and aggravated upon the first 5 minutes of my arrival, after politely asking her if the room she was showing me was the same I had booked (the rooms did not have the same name). After seeing her disproportionate reaction to my question, I wrote to Pablo so that I could meet with him and discuss the fact that I was feeling unwelcomed (with the intent of making arrangements to cancel my reservation). He responded that it was a misunderstanding and that I was welcomed, so I decided to move on and let it go (him and I finally never met). I should have trusted my inner voice because from there, things slowly went downhill. I am not going into the details of everything she said and done, but at the end of my stay, I reported Pablo’s mother to Airbnb for psychological harassment (that was a first - I do not feed off negativity and I did everything I could to stay at peace with everyone). Also, the host filed a claim against me for clogging her sewer drain with my used tampons, which was rejected. Long story short, Pablo’s mother tends to blame everybody for everything without acknowledging her own responsibility. I addition, she is not always truthful, not tolerant and does not seem to appreciate people staying at her house, which does not feel homey at all. My analysis of the situation is that her defensive attitude is related to her fear negative comments (because she keeps tab of everything and seems to play a game of chess, which I refuse to engage in). In retrospect, I believe none of that would have happened if Pablo’s mother had an Airbnb account of her own. I also do not appreciate how Pablo handled the situation (he let his mother deal directly with Airbnb and never communicated with me via e-mail, phone or face to face). If I did not have an office space that I could go to everyday and if I was a fragile individual, my stay in Rio would have been deeply affected by this experience (which is why I am writing this review). On a positive note, I recommend staying in Laranjeiras if safety is your first priority, but maybe closer to Rua da Laranjeiras and not as high up in the hills. I am thankful that this place was extremely affordable; otherwise the price for staying there would have been quite high.

Gloria and Alexander (the hosts) are incredible people - interesting, caring, passionate, and really wanting to make their home a place of exchange and enrichment. While staying at the Eco-house I've had loads of interesting chats with both the hosts and fellow guests! \n\nThe house itself is a brilliant space, with spacious, comfortable (and always clean!) communal areas, a lovely pool, and complete kitchen facilities. The location is well placed in between the centre and the beaches. It's well connected by bus and off the tourist trail, so you get to experience authentic Carioca life in a laid back neighbourhood. \n\nAs someone who has travelled quite a lot, i think what is available at the bucolic eco house is well beyond anything you'll find for a similar price- especially if you stay at the house long term."},{"_id":"69354251","date":{"$date":"2016-04-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4964534","reviewer_id":"65621759","reviewer_name":"Rafael","comments":"Excelente recepção.

I returned here because the enviroment in laranjeiras is so good. Many turists only knows copacabana and so on . But if you want an area very central to everything in Rio you should choose this place. There is a metro station around 2 kilometers from the house.From this station you can go everywhere in Rio. You can safely walk, take a bus , uber or a taxi to the station. Its an autentic eviroment here in laranjeiras and people are so nice here. \n\nAbout the house:\nA house with a lovely pool and a romantic and artistic garden , very friendly hosts who respect privacy and at the same time always is ready to give advises too. They speak english.\nThere is wifi here ,which functions very well also. \nThe rooms are cozy and clean and the kitchen area is outdoor . You can sit there in nice sofas enjoying the sun in the daytime or at night enjoy the silence and the sounds of abes and tropical birds.\nThe owners of the house are both artists and that is obvious when you enter the house.

In der Nacht bietet der Strand ein Höchstmaß an Spaß und Erholung, Kioske, Bars und Restaurants sind an der Küste und in den nahe gelegenen Alleen.

Sofia also gave a detailed run down of all the places worth seeing while in Porto.\n\nI have no hesitation in recommending you stay with Sofia when in Porto.

The dishwasher and washing machine worked reasonably well and the kitchen was outfitted well enough for cooking some meals at home.  Jenny keeps a great garden outside, and it's nice to have a couple basil or salad leaves at hand.  Do bear in mind the walk up when booking, we were well aware of this, so it was fine, but understandably for some with many bags it could get a little tough.

Although I am definitely not a clean freak, his place was not clean by our basic standard. It was even a health hazard. READ ON... TO THE END!!! The toilet in the room with private bathroom was flushing when it felt like it (50% of the time). We were advised by Patrick to use the other toilet, which was also flushing half the time! A plumber was called only days later. There was a huge hole in the ceiling above the bathtub in the room. I was afraid of what would fall from it while showering. The walls, door knobs and fixtures in the bedroom (and everywhere) were very dirty. After being advised by airbnb to talk with Patrick about cleanliness, he said this was not a hotel! But, Patrick did somehow clean the room a bit after telling us only if we were out of the apartment! The stove was not functioning very well. He told us about the stove right away after we arrived, but did nothing about fixing it until 2 or 3 days later. Cooking on the stove was out. We were in NY during a heat wave, and because the air conditioning machines were on at the same time, the power went out for a while, so we were in the dark! The second night we were there, we saw mice in the kitchen and lots of unsafe droppings. Patrick replied to my messages after a while and came home to clean. That is when he told us he had caught a mouse in his kitchen a few days prior to our arrival!!! He did call the exterminator, but we did not feel like eating there anymore, or continue to stay there for that matter. We were on edge the entire time because we had no other place to stay. We wasted 4 days looking for another place to stay, and of course, all the other places we had in mind were no longer available! Plus, the first night we arrived in the building, we saw cockroaches in the stairway. I asked Patrick right away about cockroaches and he told us there were none in his apartment, but ... we did see them in the living room but he denied it being a cockroach. We saw another one in the room we rented, we caught in on camera. We left right away. Airbnb was responsive, thank you. We provided them with all the pictures and videos to prove all these. The other concerns I have is with the location of his apartment. Despite what he told me, it is NOT a safe area for a woman, nor for teenager (my son was with me). We were afraid to walk after dark. Even during the day, the area is quite sketchy! Patrick, although I am sure you are a nice person, we are unable to recommend your apartment to anyone.0 star..."},{"_id":"6100913","date":{"$date":"2013-07-30T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"501693","reviewer_id":"5615132","reviewer_name":"Steve","comments":"Patrick was very helpful and hospitable, and the apartment was quite comfortable with a great location.

After that we left early and came in late. The only suggestion I have for anyone coming to explore NYC is to make sure you realize that 100th Street is quite far from Times Square. We did a lot of walking an finally resorted to using the subway, but some of the stations were under construction so even that did not save us much time or money. We ended up having to take a cab quite often. All in all, for two women exploring NYC and tagging along on our children's school trip, it was a perfect place to stay that saved us a ton of money!!

He was unapologetic about being late to meet us and appeared disinterested in our plight. We had to pay a passer by to carry our bags upstairs and we could not access the room until after 3 pm as it had not been prepared. We were exhausted from having to stand around waiting for him and we had no access to any ablutions and had to go to the local deli where the toilets were disgusting. Patrick had no soap in the bathroom and told us that most of the travellers bring their own soap??? He didn't have tea or coffee available for us to utilise as he said he changed the way he was operating but hadn't advised me and as I had already been to the shop I was annoyed that I hadn't been told before. To his credit he went to the shop and bought soap and shampoo and he also gave us his coffee beans and grinder so we could make coffee. At the end of our stay he did take our suitcases down to the pavement and hailed a taxi. Overall a disappointing experience for us and makes us reluctant to use the service again.

Our room was smaller than what we had expected from the photos and info provided. The bathroom was small but well appointed except for a loose toilet seat.\r\nWe did not meet our host face to face until day 3 of our stay but had emailed him on \r\narrival to say we had got in but also to ask if he could exchange flanalette sheets with cotton because of the heat (in spite of the air conditioner). We also  informed him that there had been no room in the fridge for us to put our provisions and that I had moved things from a shelf to make (Website hidden by Airbnb) received an email response that evening telling us that this was an old building, we needed to lower our expectations and have due regard for the needs of other guests who had left provisions. At this point we were the only ones in the apartment and were unaware that there were other guests at this time.\r\n The sheets issue was never addressed but we met the other guests the next morning and introduced ourselves. We were surprised that there were no locks on the doors of the rented rooms.\r\nWe would describe this as more of a share house arrangement rather than hosted accommodation and this was disappointing."},{"_id":"80015212","date":{"$date":"2016-06-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"501693","reviewer_id":"50120970","reviewer_name":"Zoe","comments":"Just returned from an 8 day stay at Patrick's and had the most amazing time!

Lovely 15-min walk across Central Park to Mt. Sinai, which was the reason for our visit.\r\n\r\nAccommodation: The space was very clean and the bedroom provides ample and efficient storage for clothes and outlets for recharging devices.  The bed is comfortable and the room is really well noise-insulated allowing for a great night’s sleep.  The private shower/tub is very nice and an assortment of personal care products are provided.\r\n\r\nTemperature Note:  I especially appreciated the window fan and aircon unit.  I found the space warm even in early November, which was likely a combination of me being post menopause and also an older building / 4th floor.  The window unit kept me very comfortable, but from an energy conservation perspective I felt guilty and in hindsight would have packed shorts and t-shirt.\r\n\r\nHost:  Patrick was very responsive and accommodating.\r\n\r\nGreat stay – recommend with no hesitations.\r\n\r\n"},{"_id":"113696665","date":{"$date":"2016-11-13T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"501693","reviewer_id":"102777124","reviewer_name":"Janet","comments":"Patrick's apartment was exactly as described and impeccably clean.

Plenty of space for staring some basic groceries. We didn't buy much but nice to have some breakfast before heading out for the day.\n\nPatrick was good at communication, both in the time leading up to our trip and when we arrived in NYC. He sent a text with an explanation and photos on how to access the keys since he was out for the evening. Very efficient. Check out was a breeze.\n\nFinally, this was a great area to stay because it was away from the craziness in Mid-town. It's also safe and very pretty with the park and architecture."},{"_id":"157318442","date":{"$date":"2017-06-03T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"501693","reviewer_id":"25739003","reviewer_name":"Jessica","comments":"awsone location, just next to the central park, and 2 minutes to subway."},{"_id":"158551482","date":{"$date":"2017-06-07T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"501693","reviewer_id":"122267594","reviewer_name":"Patty","comments":"Communication was easy and Patrick responded quickly.

The kitchen \n       area where you are meant to store your food was dirty with old dripping food stains (Website hidden by Airbnb) Fridge and cooker very much the same.

Celui-ci était de loin le meilleur des trois! L'emplacement était parfait : à quelques minutes de la ligne 3 du métro (très très pratique!), à quelques rues des fêtes de Gracia mais loin du tumulte qui s'en dégageait. Le quartier est calme et les voisins aussi! La chambre principale, bien qu'elle donne sur la rue, a été très confortable, car la rue en question est une impasse donc quasiment aucun trafic, seulement des piétons donc idéal. \r\n\r\nPeter a véritablement été un hôte parfait! Pour commencer, il était là à notre arrivée, souriant et agréable.. il a même fait l'effort de nous parler en Français. Il nous a fait visiter l'appartement, très propre, décoré avec soin et très bien agencé. L'appartement était fidèle aux nombreuses photos publiées. On y a trouvé tout ce dont on avait besoin (jusqu'au fer à repasser et le presse agrumes!). Le patio et la climatisation sont appréciables.\r\nPeter s'est rendu disponible et prompt à nous conseiller. Attention, il n'était pas omniprésent mais disponible lorsque nous le sollicitions, ce que nous avons vraiment apprécié. \r\n\r\nBref, nous avons tout aimé et espérons pouvoir renouveler cette belle expérience lors de notre prochain séjour. Nous vous recommandons donc vivement ce petit nid douillet où chacun devrait facilement trouver ses marques."},{"_id":"45976150","date":{"$date":"2015-09-07T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5037632","reviewer_id":"39939871","reviewer_name":"Marion","comments":"We stayed in Barcelona for four days.

The flat is nicely decorated and the little garden outside the kitchen makes the flat even more charming. One suggestion for Peter is to increase the functional lighting to make reading easier at night. Also the master bedroom is right above the school entrance so you will hear the noise from parents and kids waiting for the school door to open in the morning.

Wer genau hinschaut, sieht, dass kleine orangefarbenen Blüten mit Draht ganz unauffällig an die Hecke appliziert wurden. Es ist ruhig in der Wohnung  obwohl sie mitten immStadtteil Garcia liegt . Fußläufig sind Cafés und Restaurants, kleine Supermärkte erreichbar.  Besonders gut kann man in den kleinen Geschäften shoppen und findet auch Angebote einheimischer Künstler. Metro und Bus sind ganz in der Nähe. Wir können die Wohnung uneingeschränkt empfehlen und bedanken uns bei PeterPaul ganz herzlich für seine  Gastfreundschaft."},{"_id":"93771302","date":{"$date":"2016-08-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5037632","reviewer_id":"64301671","reviewer_name":"Mario","comments":"Very cute apartment and wonderful, attentive hosts!

It was the type of place you expect to come home to after a long day of walking up and down La Diagonal. The L3 metro line was a couple blocks down and made it perfect to take everywhere we planned to go. There is many supermercat's around the area where you can go grab some fruit or a 6 pack of Estrellas (what we drank our entire trip). We were able to go buy eggs, coffee, and bread to make breakfast at 3 in the morning. We were extremely happy to stay in the neighborhood of Gracia. Peter and Oscar were very accommodating. They made sure we were comfortable and felt at home. From the cozy balcony to the vintage typewriter in the living room, everything about the Orange Tree flat gave us the best Barcelona experience. \r\n\r\nTips to other Air BnB visitors: \r\n1. Get lost in the streets of Gracia. Like seriously. Forget the GPS and walk around and turn corners. You will find beauty everywhere you go. We took that chance and ended up at a free jazz concert in one of the gorgeous squares and had an amazing time.\r\n2. Bring European plug adapters.\r\n3. Grab a map of the Metro line. Peter has some by the table.

Peter Paul was quick to correspond with me throughout the process from booking our place in June until after we left.  \nThis was the first time using AirBNB so he set a high standard for others to achieve.  \nThe apartment itself was wonderful. It was clean and it looked exactly like the pictures. Such a great style.  The patio is great for a cup of wine in the morning or a glass of wine at night.  \nThe location was perfect, as we felt like we lived in Barcelona for our 4 night visit.  The neighborhood of Garcia is perfection. Great coffee shops, bars, restaurants, and markets all within 5 minute walking distance and beyond and the Fontana Metro stop is the gateway to the rest of Barcelona. \nOscar was nice enough to let us know the layout of the city and special events happening during the weekend, which included La Merce, the largest festival Barcelona puts on during the year. The events and fireworks were incredible. \nWe also wrote Oscar during our trip for advice on a Paella restaurant. He gave us a couple of options and we chose 7 Portes and it was fantastic. \nOur time in Barcelona was absolutely perfect, and the apartment was definitely a piece of that puzzle.

It was clean, comfortable, and pleasant. \n\nThe Gracia neighborhood was very quaint with narrow streets and shady plazas where the locals gather to relax and socialize. There are many restaurants, grocery stores, and shops a short distance from the flat. Gracia offers the opportunity to meet some of the Catalan and Spanish residents, while avoiding the crowd of tourists in the Ramble, Barri Gotic, and El Born. These areas are an easy and quick Metro ride away. The Metro stop is a short two block walk. \n\nPeter is very friendly, helpful and eager to assist in any possible way. \n\nFive stars for the Orange Tree Flat and five stars for Peter."},{"_id":"221339659","date":{"$date":"2017-12-26T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5037632","reviewer_id":"33297443","reviewer_name":"Cornelia Sabelström","comments":"We stayed with Peter for Christmas, my children (18 and 28 years of age) and I (60), and had a wonderful time.

It is all double-glazed though and nice and dark. Peter greeted us himself and even walked us down the road to get our bearings. He recommended a lovely area for food nearby which didn't disappoint.

The apartment itself is very warm and cozy—we loved to unwind with some wine in the living room before turning in. He also left a lot of amenities in the bathroom's mirrored cabinets and under the sink so we had everything we needed to get ready.

Great neighborhood but lots of stairs going up if you are walking home (that's why they have taxis). Even the security people were great.

This is quite nice considering it's a mere 5 minute walk to the bustle of Hollywood Road with its shopping, bars and restaurants. Audrey was great about communicating information.  I would certainly stay here again, though I must stress that I find it surprising that the place is listed as sleeping four people. There is one full sized bed and a love seat that pulls out into a mattress. I'd say it sleeps 3 comfortably--3 that are okay with close quarters.

Almost 360 degree view of Hong Kong. Breathtaking. \nThe location of the apartment was also very very nice. It was in a really charming and authentic Hong Kong neighborhood. Fantastic atmosphere with all the locals going about their daily lives. \nIf there is 1 downside to the location though it's that it's hard work walking there everyday. The hills can be steep and there is many steps so you'll most likely be tired when you get to the apartment. Just be prepared for that. However I wouldn't say this as a negative because I feel the pros of the apartment outweigh any negatives you can have about it. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat. LOVED IT. \n\nAudrey was also a fantastic host and she was great to communicate with. Always a simple message away and would always reply quickly if you had any questions or anything. \n\nYou just need to look at all the positive reviews this place has to see that it's amazing. \n\nIf you're looking for an apartment in Hong Kong, stop your search and book this one. You will NOT regret it. "},{"_id":"54443217","date":{"$date":"2015-11-20T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"505456","reviewer_id":"18019484","reviewer_name":"Kara","comments":"Great experience!

The apartment was very clean and also had everything I needed (like a microwave, stove and sink so I could prepare simple baby food for my kid). Audrey's instructions and HK guide was also very precise and useful, and she was also very accommodating to my requests and always responded very quickly, which I appreciate greatly! \n\nThe apartment is set on a quiet street and is flanked by nice cafes serving good food and coffee so we had no problems finding breakfast each morning. My only problem was trying to get a cab as that street did not have many cabs passing by and so we had to trek down Pound Lane (a rather steep flight of steps) to flag a cab from Hollywood street instead, which was quite inconvenient for me because we constantly had to carry our baby and the stroller up and down those stairs. Fortunately I had a friend in HK who helped me book a cab to the airport so I didn't have to worry about finding transport to the airport when I was leaving HK.

Nous nous sommes mis d'accord avec l'hôte pour réserver d'abord uniquement le premier mois. Les photos laissaient voir un appartement moderne, rénové, propre et avec beaucoup de place de rangement. Malheureusement, ce ne fût pas le cas: des trous dans le mur, peu d'espaces, des traces de poussières sur les armoires, les armoires presque remplies des affaires personnelles de l'hôte etc...\r\nNous avons donc commencé notre séjour par une déception... qui a duré 1 mois. L'hôte nous a cependant proposé une machine a café et d'autres ustensiles pour cuisiner, mais suite à notre demande d'annulation dès le deuxième jour suivant notre arrivée nous n'avons pas exprimé le désir de ceux-ci. Puisque nous voulions entreposer nos valises, nous avons demandé à notre hôte si nous pouvions les entreposer dans le couloir ou dans la cage d'escaliers (puisque l'appartement est sécurisé et qu'un portier est à la réception). Elle nous a suggéré de demander au portier si nous pouvions les mettre dans la cage d'escalier, ce dernier nous a dit \"OK\" après quelques explications. Cependant quelques heures après les valises avaient disparues de la cage d'escalier car cet endroit été en fait le coin ordures (ce qui n'a pas été mentionné par l'hôte) et quelqu'un les a prises et jetées à la poubelle. Suite à notre requête concernant la détérioration du bien et donc le fait que les photos ne reflétaient pas la réalité, Airbnb nous a donné gain de cause en nous remboursant une partie de la réservation.\r\nA notre grande déception, les rangements étaient quasi inexistants, en effet l'armoire était littéralement à moitié occupée par les affaires de l'hôte, même chose pour le bureau et salle de bain. \r\nLa cuisine quand à elle n'était pas propre, les assiettes collantes ainsi des traces de rouilles sur le comptoir (qui partent pourtant à la brosse..). Le plan de travail vieillit et abimé.\r\nA prendre en compte aussi le fait que lorsqu'il pleut, la pluie ricoche sur une pièce métallisée à proximité du lit ce qui provoque un bruit incessant et pas franchement agréable car beaucoup trop assourdissant. \r\nLe quartier est néanmoins très sympathique même si l'appartement est certes à Sheung Wan mais dans les très hauteurs et qu'il est épuisant de monter les TRES nombreux escaliers depuis le métro pour parvenir à l'appartement, notamment en pleine journée d'été. En résumé: le prix est excessif pour le bien proposé, les photos en ligne ne reflètent pas le bien proposé et ce dernier ne convient certainement pas pour un long séjour. Cependant il peut être agréable pour une ou deux personnes à une période où il ne fait pas trop chaud et humide (à éviter en Juillet et Aout) à Hong Kong, pour un week end ou un nombre restreint de jours. Il nous a surtout déçu car il n'était pas à la hauteur du standard des photos publiées mais également dû au prix exorbitant de ce bien."},{"_id":"103504426","date":{"$date":"2016-09-22T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"505456","reviewer_id":"88138249","reviewer_name":"Marcus","comments":"The flat was very clean and very cosy!

Perfect location for me visiting friends nearby and Sheung Wan also my favourite neighbourhood in HK. Great communication with Audrey and her husband and perfect instructions for accessing the apartment, I had no trouble at all. Friendly doorman at building entrance. High floor so good views of the mid-levels and towards HKU. Fairly small as photos show but ok for me and manageable for a couple. Limited kitchen but useful fridge and I ate out mostly, enjoying the local food in Sheung Wan, and lots of places on and around Hollywood Road only short walk away. If you don't know the area, you won't be aware of the steep paths and steps. If you have lots of luggage, you can obviously take taxi but also buses go from Exchange Square in front of Hong Kong station (8 or 22) to Hospital Road which is just above where the apartment is and then is a walk down steps rather than up which is handy!

Also a renowned coffee bar, interesting stores, and a yoga studio less than a minute’s walk from the front door. And a gentlemen’s tailor in the same building. The view from the apartment is stunning, all the way across the water to Kowloon and beyond. Audrey’s apt is small but with ample storage (even for a month long stay).  It is immaculately clean. Hot water is only available in the shower, not in the kitchen or bathroom sink which is fairly common in older buildings. The building is safe, well maintained with a circulating trio of care takers working out of an office by the elevators. We are already planning our return visit.

Cleanliness and ease of access were extremely important to me, and I'm happy to say that I was very pleased, in both these aspects and others, with this apartment. It was well cleaned when I got there. Apartments in HK are naturally small. Dont be thrown off by this. The fridge, bed, wardrobe, and desk were more than enough for a long term stay. The washroom was a decent size as well, and had good shower and flushing. You'll get used to how small it is, and honestly, based on other apartments I saw my friends staying in while we were in HK, this place is a good size. I fit an extra person for a week comfortably when a friend visited me. Also, don't be throw off by the exterior and front of the building. The inside is quite clean and new! A/C was great as well, and I used it just as a fan (cool setting was turned to lowest) to keep the air flowing even when the weather got cold. All in all, good apartment for long term (and I am extremely picky). In terms of the actual location, I loved it. Great grocery stores around (chatham place is around the corner, and then the other way there are a handful of different grocery stores too). At least 5 grocery stores are within a couple blocks. Good fast food around as well. And ofc, being Hong Kong, there are 7-11s and Circle Ks just across the street and around the block. Take a walk around on your first day! In particular, I liked how this street was more quiet and more residential than HK island. I was in central for work on a daily basis, and so this place is a nice escape from the crowded tall buildings. Buses around the block go basically everywhere. I prefer buses personally but if you need the train, Hung Hom station is a 10 min bus ride away. Hung Hom also has the train that goes towards Shenzhen, so makes for a good day trip location. All in all, convenient and safe. Didnt feel weird walking around at 1 am. Theres a little family owned restaurant right downstairs that's open very late. \n\nOwner: kind, very responsive. At one point, the toilet didn't flush and Chris was very fast in replying to me. In the end, it was just a building issue so it had nothing to do with them. But he was still very fast in responding and trying to set up someone to come by. Chris is very professional and responsible.

The big street right outside of the room is very noisy even during the late night. When it is raining, the water pour on the top of the AC unit which has a thin metal case and cause super loud noise all night long. The toilet tank is leaking so the floor is constantly wet. Hot water boiler of the bath was suddenly malfunction once during my 40 days long stay. Chris got someone to fix it when I was away. Room size is about 2.1m x 3.5m including the toilet/bathroom which is about 0.9m x 1.4m. Blanket is thin and I can't sleep well because it was pretty chilly and wet on early March. A tiny fridge and a water boiler for instant noodles is provided but no hairdryer. Shampoo and shower gel is mixed with a lot of water. Laundromat is few blocks away.

The landlord associate noted the same thing and said the space should cool down. She stated the fans and air conditioning are extremely loud throughout the day and would not recommend staying in the apartment in the afternoon (not an optimal situation if you are with a young child). After a full day of waiting, the apartment temperature got worse. It was so hot it was impossible to be in the space for more than (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) minutes as the vents were blowing out heated air.  We texted the landlords associate and immediately received a response back of \"oops!\"  She quickly noted nothing could be done until Monday. The responses were so immediate we began to wonder if this was already an ongoing issue.  I was arriving later in the day with our toddler and told my wife to go to a hotel as the space was not habitable. I called the landlord who informed us he owned the property since Feb and this was their first summer. I explained we only had a few more days and I would like a refund which he agreed to immediately. It seemed the landlord was going to resolve the situation with a full refund but THIS DID NOT HAPPEN. After 10 days, I had not receive a refund so I called the landlord. He stated he was going to refund my money outside of airbnb as it was complex and asked for my (Hidden by Airbnb) account. When this did not happen I called airbnb who informed me refunds outside airbnb are not recommended policy. Airbnb is now involved for a resolution. Just to mention the apartment looked very good aesthetically but there was no door on the bathroom which is actually upstairs in the bedroom.  This may be uncomfortable for most from a privacy standpoint.  There were also some exposed wires in the bathroom looking as though there were some lighting renovations being done.  Overall, beautiful apartment but not habitable in the Barcelona summer heat with the broken air conditioner. No matter how beautiful  this apartment looks  if it can not be cooled down because it is on the top floor it is not a penthouse it is an attic.We did not spend even one night in this apartment and look forward to providing all the information we have to airbnb to hopefully get the promised refund.

There's a couple of pharmacies, a few grocery stores, nd plenty of places to eat. There's a little place that does amazing pastries and coffee on the corner near where the bus is (opposite the noodle place) that I really recommend! It's right near two bus routes, both of which that take you to metros so transport is really good.\nIn terms of the actual house, it has everything you would need.

L'appartement est conforme aux photos,en bas deux chambres,une avec un lit simple et la seconde avec un lit double plus un lit simple superposé. Il y a aussi une salle de bain avec douche et WC. La cuisine est bien équipée cafetière italienne,micro-onde,four, un frigo assez grand et tous le nécessaire pour cuisiné. Un petit salon avec un canapé deux place plus une table et 4 chaises sont aussi présente ainsi qu'une Tv a écran plat et le Wi-fi. Et a l'étage une chambre double avec une salle de bain ( baignoire) et un WC. Le plus de cet appartement et sa terrasse qui est bien ensoleillée toute la journée mais il y store qui permet de ce faire une petite place d'ombre bien agréable,elle possède une grande table avec un banc et des chaise plus un bain de soleil pour des scéances bronzage. Nous avons passé la plupart de notre temps sur cette terrasse,vraiment très agréable.  Le quartier est calme de jour comme de nuit,peu de passage dans la rue qui est a sens unique. Une épicerie,un marchand de fruit et légume, une boulangerie sont a 2min même pas de l'appartement,ainsi que le métro (station Congrès ligne bleu ),il il y a également juste a côté un tabac et deux petits bar a tapas typique.

Dejamos el coche en el parking que está en la calle de al lado.\r\nComo dato negativo indicaría el olor a cañería de los baños, sobre todo en el del piso de abajo. La maquinaria del ascensor se escucha bastante en la habitación del piso de arriba, pero no molesta a la hora de dormir, por la noche, ya que apenas hay movimiento a esas horas. Y hay que tener en cuenta también, para los que necesiten oscuridad total para dormir, que tanto en la habitación de arriba como en la pequeña de abajo no hay persiana.

Although we didn’t interact with them too much due to being busy sightseeing, they were very kind and gracious in our short interactions and via text, gave us our privacy, very accessible and provided everything we could possibly need. We arrived the first day to a wonderfully made up bed and a five-star hotel-like arrangement of fresh towels, tissue, shampoo and conditioner, and free bottled water sitting right on top of it. The bed was very comfortable. The AC worked perfect. The room was a good space. And the bathroom was clean, modern looking, and perfect size as well. Few days in, we noted how the only things missing in the room would be a towel rack and mirror and miraculously (almost scary, mind-reading type scary), Lee and Daniel had a new towel rack and mirror waiting for us the very next day. Seriously, FIVE STAR service. My girlfriend even remarked that they should open up their own hotel! The place was also very short walk away from both AC and J trains (which both take you to Manhattan in no time). Convenient stores close all over. We highly recommend staying with Lee and Daniel. They were very responsive to all our concerns and didn’t even mind our late-night arrivals, even though we felt bad because we didn’t want to wake them up with the door noise and such. Hope you choose their place and have as great a time with them as we did!

This probably wouldn't be an issue if you didn't come back to the room after 8pm. \n\nOverall great value.

Its just that the photos are not accurate. \n2. I think its a minimum courtesy to have atleast a bottle of milk in the fridge and small bag of coffee for the new tenants. \nI was shocked to see totaly empty cupboards and only 4 rolls of toilet paper for the entire 6 nights for 2 adults.\n\nIn general I dont think that the apartment is bad.

Chose étonnante pour une réservation AirBnB, nous avons dû fournir un grand nombre de renseignements qui sont habituellement demandés lors d'une réservation auprès d'un professionnel (N° de passeport, information personnelle ... ), y aurait-il une activité professionnelle cachée derrière ces annonces d'appartements particuliers ? ou Vanessa posséderait-elle, à elle seule une bonne dizaine d'appartements ? \r\n\r\nL'appartement est dans un bon quartier, et est correct mais un peu cher lors de notre location (109euros). Son emplacement est intéressant, situé dans la partie droite de l'eixample entre la vieille ville (gothique) et la Sagrada Famillia de Gaudi. le métro est à 5 minutes à pied du métro Tetuan.\r\n\r\nUne fois les clés remises, nous avons constaté que la fenêtre de la salle de bain menaçait de tomber si nous tentions de l'ouvrir ( fenêtre glissante ne glissant plus sur son rail), pire, la fenêtre de la chambre ne fermait pas du tout ! Ce qui est peu sécurisant au premier étage même si il ne faut pas tomber dans la paranoïa. Après appel et avoir expliqué  le problème, la fenêtre a été réparée dans la matinée suivante par le frère de Vanessa. \r\n\r\nAutre point négatif, une odeur de relent d’égout se faisait sentir par vague même après aération de l'appartement en ouvrant ce qu'il était possible d'ouvrir, l'odeur revenait peu de temps après. Nous comprenons donc mieux pourquoi un désodorisant fraîcheur marine ainsi qu'un pot d’encens huilé était présent et actif avant notre arrivée.\r\n\r\nLe quartier n'est pas spécialement bruyant (pas de fêtards) mais l'appartement étant peu isolé et les locaux aimant parler fort et tard (3h du matin) nous avons était gênés 2 nuits sur les 5 passées sur place.\r\n\r\nLa porte coulissante de la salle de bien ne permet pas une bonne isolation avec la pièce principale, laissant un jour de 5 cm dans le haut et semblant un peu fragile. Comment font les gens pour satisfaire leurs besoins sans ainsi en faire part à leur partenaire et je ne parle pas dans le cas ou il y a 4 personnes à résidence.\r\n\r\nConclusions, un peu déçu de ce séjour en amoureux, légèrement entaché par ces mésaventures.

Supermarkets available in walking distance too.\n\nThe apartment itself was very functional for our party of two (one adult and one teenager). Stayed 5 nights. Sleeping needs were comfy. Possibility to cook were nice to have. Cool little balcony as well. \nCommunication went very smoothly with the hosts. Got help with the keys upon arrival and then with the WiFi. No worries. \n\nA bit of annoyance was however the heavy bad smell when entering the apartment. We thought first it came from the bathroom but no. Mentioned this to the host, but nothing was done. A real pity as the apartment is very clean and nice but smell pretty bad. \nWe were pretty cold as well, but after turn-in the radiators during all our stay while we were in the apartment, it went fine. Cold air was coming through the surrounding of the bedroom window which made it pretty chilly for the head. \n\nAll-in-all a nice apartment, well-located and very functional.

It's also got a lot of good places to eat within walking distance as well, from great value to fine dining.\n\nThe apartment itself is nice, it has a balcony overlooking the back of other apartment buildings but it gets sun and is a pleasant place to eat your lunch or take your morning coffee. The kitchen is well equipped for a short-stay and had a small welcome pack of kitchen essentials which was a nice touch. The apartment does have an air conditioner but it's quite high up the wall of a spacious apartment so its effects are not entirely noticeable. I got better cooling by leaving the french doors open for a while when there was a breeze. The bathroom is perfectly fine, the toilet is in an alcove and can be a tight space for someone of my height (6ft 4).\n\nThe bedroom is lovely, big and very comfortable bed (difficult to wake up in the morning!) and it has a window and blackout blinds which were very effective.

The bed in a cozy corner of the living room was sufficient. As this was a very last minute booking that was needed for only 7 hours--a night's rest and a shower--I was grateful that Christine accepted the request. She was helpful with directions and due to the late hour (10 pm) she retreated to bed.  At that point, it was like having the small apartment to oneself. Due to the summer heat, the fan in the window in front of the bed was a welcome addition. Overall, staying there was a pleasant experience, especially due to the artistic flair to the apartment and the privacy the short visit afforded.

Biray is a really friendly, kind and intelligent girl with a great taste in movies and literature. We had amazing conversations with her and we felt right at home from the start. Biray was away most of the time, but always really quick to respond; as a result, we had the whole apartment to ourselves, which worked out great for us since as we had to work from home during the day. The personable Zeytin, Biray's cat, was an additional bonus to keep us company, as well as her cousin who stayed over on occasion too. The apartment was in a perfect neighborhood, with lots of local shops  with fresh produce and food options nearby. The taxim square and Istiklal Cadessi were only a 25min walk away. A friendly host, great location and certainly a memorable stay.

The thing that Biray didn't emphasize enough is that her neighbour is only the best shopping-entartainment mall in the entire world - Cevahir! :D\r\nOn a side note, there really isn't anything that a guest could complain about while staying at Biray's residence. The location is perfect, since it's also 5-10 minutes on foot to metro, that gets you to Taksim in just 2 stops. The room is nice, and so is the toalet, kitchen, and the balcony. Only bit of an issue can be a WiFi which reaches to around the door of the room. Regarding the hosts, Biray and her cat were very considerate and polite. We didn't get much of a chance to get to know Biray very well, but she certainly is a professional host and always ready to give you useful advices and insights of her city.

A great view over the Bosphorus, with double glazing so no traffic noise - but we preferred leaving the windows open so we could hear the call to prayer! A great location to explore the trendy area around Taksim full of bars and restaurants, and an easy taxi ride to the old sites. Also near the port to get the ferry to the Asian side, which is fantastic. So all in all, a great and comfortable place to explore the city. \n\nAs well as this Aylin was a wonderful host - so warm, welcoming and friendly, had great recommendations and answered all our questions and teacher very quickly and helpfully.

Ruhig?\r\n\r\nIm nachhinein: Besser geht's nicht. Man ist zu Fuß in 5min am Taksim Platz und Co., wo all die Geschäfte und Restaurants sind. Man muss wirklich nur eine Straße hochlaufen. Von dort aus fährt auch die Metro. \r\n\r\nIch bin abends meist gegen Mitternacht rum heim und es war alles sicher.

The location of the apartment is very close to the center and there are amazing restaurants for dinner or dessert right around the apartment, which my boyfriend and I really liked! A few downsides were the disgusting smell in the apartment which lasted the whole stay and the low water pressure in the shower. The check-in and check- out worked without any problem and Irem booked reservations at restaurants for us, whenever we asked her to. Since our flight was in the afternoon but check out is at 11am, Irem offered us a secure space to leave our luggage, so we didn't have to carry it around and enjoy the last few hours. The bed wasn't super comfortable especially since it was two beds just placed next to each other, so the gap in between was a bit annyoing and uncomfortable. Last but not least the apartment seems very safe and we had an amazing stay in Istanbul."},{"_id":"254567774","date":{"$date":"2018-04-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5170796","reviewer_id":"137520653","reviewer_name":"Nataliya","comments":"Замечательное жильё для семейной пары.

In a very few minutes one can be in Manhattan (subway runs the whole night). It is also surrounded by shops that are cheaper as compared to other areas in Williamsburg. The room is spacious, with air conditioning, and it is furnished with a few vintage pieces and overall very good taste. Walker was very kind and he provided me with all the information I needed. Moreover he allowed me to have a very late check in that was great, as I had to work the day following my last night I  stayed at his place. Also the other (Hidden by Airbnb) were very nice and friendly. \r\nI would also recommend this place mainly to young people because of the general vibe, as the previous reviewer did. \r\nLast but not least, the apartment have access to a roof with a breathtaking view of Manhattan skyline!

We were lucky enough to meet one of them during a lovely evening amongst friends, when we were invited to join them for a cordial drink or two up at their rooftop. The weather was perfect and the view was stunning. Walker and his friends are mad witty and smart and I wouldn't think it twice to join them again for a beer! It is truly great to know one can meet enticing people such as Walker and his friends through a medium such as AirBnB.\n\nRegarding the apartment: Walker's room and the common areas in general are so clean, and organized in a way that you wished a) they were yours b) something that was yours had looked like that at some point. It is really mad incredible, with a myriad of awesome details to delight in. The apartment counts with a fully equipped kitchen, ample bathroom, ACs, wifi, and full-on privacy. There was another AirBnBer staying at the other roommate's room while we were there as well, and we barely noticed any other noises and/or disturbances. Everything was extremely quiet and everyone was very  polite. Aside from that, Walker made himself available for anything we needed. Thanks so much once again, we enjoyed our stay!

Sydney's inner city suburbs are surrounded by cafe cultures. Love eating and living in the inner city buzz without living right in the middle of the city either. My fave cafés and restaurants are in Newtown, Enmore, Leichhardt and Surry Hills! \r\n\r\nI love to travel to eat and shop. I have travelled around Europe staying with many \"Airbnb\" accommodation so understand the importance of being a good host. Plus I do genuinely enjoy giving advice to guests. It is also a very rewarding feeling when I hear my guests having a good time because of my advice. :)  However, my husband and I do lead incredibly busy lives and because we lead such busy lives, when we do have downtime, we love to have a chat with our guests, catch up for supper etc to wind-down. We have gained friends through hosting and I do believe that hosting is like \"hosting my friends that I haven't met yet!\" I treat all my guests like I would my longtime friends so I do hope my guests treat me back the same way by being polite and respectful of my house.\r\n\r\nWhen I am a Guest at an Airbnb accommodation, I will always treat the house like it is my own and respect it.

The apartment was very clean, orderly and was very photogenic as well. We really enjoyed our stay here. Miss D and her husband were very kind and accomodating, and even helped us book a cab for our super early flight. I highly recommend this apartment jf you want to maximize you.

The room is nice and clean, but as there were 3 of us, an extra mattress was added in front of the bed, making the room a little smaller and cramp, but still there is room for us to open 3 luggages at the same time, just that it makes it a little hard to walk. \n\nThere is a common lounge and kitchen for everyone's use, cereals and milk provided as well for breakfast! There are 2 toilets, one in the building, one outside the house, a right turn from the kitchen just few steps away. Towels and toiletries are provided as well. However, as it is a shared toilet, it gets a little messy and dirty over the days.\n\nWe stayed for 4 days and generally it was a quite a pleasant stay and the room is cosy enough.

The Newtown neighborhood is actually a destination in and of itself. Lots of interesting places to explore including plenty of shops, pubs, and restaurants nearby. Station st. is a quaint and classic street with most of buildings from the late 1800's and early 1900's! The building and room are lovely! **Just note that there are actually 4 rooms in MissD's home each with a unique character. Mine was on the first level and featured a very clean \u0026 modern decor with high ceilings. There are two shared shower facilities and a communal kitchen. Public transport to the city via train is great and fast but if going to the airport, I found the taxi / Uber style service to be more convenient. I didn't get to meet the host until check-out but there was an easy self check-in/check-out method available!

It was more of a hostel than we expected as the other rooms of the town house were also rented out via Airbnb. As we did not spend any time in the house apart from sleeping at night and showering in the mornings we never really met any of the other people staying there. The only negative bit would be that my sister was sleeping on a mattress on the floor and there was no top sheet for her and only bare blankets and no doona. When we asked for a top sheet as it feels fresher miss d said: \"why would you need that?\". When we arrived to the accommodation there was also an unwashed plate in the kitchen, which we got a message about the next day implying that we had left it. As we never had any breakfast at the accommodation but went out to eat it could not have been us. We did not reply to that message though as we felt it had nothing to do with us, and maybe the guest which left the plate had cleaned up after him or herself. \nI am sorry if we came across as rude guests asking for the top sheet and not replying to the message about the plate. But for guests coming in the future: if there is dishes left by other people, maybe just do them for the sake of peace or tell miss d immediately, and if you are more than two people staying in one room, you can maybe bring a set of travel sheets for the one not sleeping in the bed.\nWe never met miss d and only communicated via this app. The house was clean and if you just need somewhere close to sleep it is a good place to stay.\nKind regards"},{"_id":"104099644","date":{"$date":"2016-09-25T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5178277","reviewer_id":"16819057","reviewer_name":"Verena","comments":"The house is located in a great neighborhood with lots of places to eat around and just a short train ride from the touristic center.

After our original apartment ended up being horrific MissD was such a breath of fresh air. She responded quickly, and had her husband go and clean up for us, and he was there to greet us and give us the lay of the land. He was wonderful! \n\nThese guys are suuuuuper organized!  They also have just about everything you could want, from shelf space (evenly divided by per room) to daily cereal \u0026 milk (that is replenished daily). Everything is neat and tidy, and the place truly is \"chic\" and has great design esthetic. \n\nThe best part of all of this is the LOCATION! Not only is this city soooo cool and full of restaurants, bars, shops, etc. You're a 5 minute (or less)  walk to the train station and bus stops! All in all, I hiiiiiighly recommend this place!

There is cereal and milk for breakfast along with various beverages and condiments such as sugar, coffee, tea etc.\nThe room also has a heater in case it gets too cold. The bedding was clean and hygienic. And professional cleaners clean the common spaces pretty frequently.\nLocation is just a stone’s throw away from Enmore road and the bus stop is just 5 minutes away.\nAll in all, it’s GREAT value for money.

It’s a small cottage style house with a friendly ambience in Sydney. The metro is near- just 5 mins of walking distance. You can use the metro to go anywhere to the city. Cabs are abundant in the area as well. We didn’t expect the place to be full of love and we met many friendly house mates there.  It exceeds our expectations. \n\nThe bathroom and lounge area is indeed lovely. We had friendly chit chat with some of our housemates. Coffee, towel, tea, mugs and most amenities were provided. We had a heater in the room to keep ourselves warm. Overall, we love her place and would come back again next time. I would rate her place 10/10. \n\nI would recommend people staying at her cosy place anytime. Next time you are coming to Malaysia, please do visit us miss D. Thank you for hosting us.

We absolutely loved our stay.  My top requirement, which was that the place was clean, was fully met.  It is a very modern and new apartment.  The furniture is good quality so the beds and the couch were very comfortable.  I liked the fact that it has both a bath and a shower so I was able to give my daughter bubble baths upstairs and I took my showers downstairs.  The WiFi was fast and the heating worked well (the temperature dropped in the evenings so this was handy).  The place was decorated tastefully and was very tranquil, just as described.  The location is also perfect.  It is located just a 5 minute walk away from the Plaza Espana, where there is a modern shopping centre with good restaurants.  It is close to 2 different subway lines (one just a block away and the other at the Plaza Espana), so there are plenty of options for getting around.  The train station is also close by.  There is a big park 1 minute away, which is great if you have children.  And there is a supermarket, a good bakery/cafe, a 24-hour pharmacy and a little grocery shop open evenings and Sundays - all nearby.  One thing that you cannot tell from the pictures or the description is where the apartment is located.  It is on the ground floor, in a private area (almost like a courtyard) behind an apartment building.  To get to it, you enter the building and then take a private, secured corridor behind the lift.  There is only one other apartment in this private area and no apartments above, so it is extremely quiet, which is refreshing after a day of being in a big, noisy city.  The only thing I recommend is that guests ask to be shown how to lock and unlock the doors to the apartment and the private corridor, as they can be a bit tricky.  They are very secure but you just need to know the trick.  Overall, the apartment was just perfect.  I would definitely stay again."},{"_id":"29868297","date":{"$date":"2015-04-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5189747","reviewer_id":"183994","reviewer_name":"Armando","comments":"The welcome person, Ivan, was super friendly.

The host, Ivan, met with us at the loft with the warmest welcome. He showed us around the loft and explained how everything worked (keys, wifi, bins, etc.), and also gave us loads of recommendations for nearby restaurants, bars and places to see. The location of the loft was just excellent. It was literally a two-minute walk from the metro station Tarragona, and about ten-minute walk from the train station.  There were several cafes, grocery stores and 24-hour pharmacy nearby. The photos here on Airbnb have shown exactly what the loft looked like. It was an independent loft on the ground floor behind a big residential building, so it was super quiet both day and night during our stay. The loft and facilities inside were in great conditions, and the beddings and towels are nice and clean."},{"_id":"33788860","date":{"$date":"2015-06-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5189747","reviewer_id":"30085788","reviewer_name":"Egoitz","comments":"La verdad que el piso esta genial y se ajusto a nuestras necesidades. \nLa etencion con la persona responsable tambien fue muy correcta."},{"_id":"34496391","date":{"$date":"2015-06-08T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5189747","reviewer_id":"33065461","reviewer_name":"Lawrence","comments":"Alain met us at the apartment; very friendly and knowledgeable, even helped us with a problem with the taxi driver we rode with from the airport. \r\nThe apartment was clean, attractively decorated, with everything working.

We were greeted by Diego and another agent. They arrived very quickly after our phone call and gave us a detailed tour of the apartment, including information on local attractions, maps, etc. They answered some tourist questions we had.\r\nMy husband is very tall (over 6ft) and struggled a bit with the ceiling height up in the loft. We ended up not using the upstairs shower, as the ceiling was quite low. This wasn't a problem, though, as the shower downstairs was just fine.\r\nWe did run out of hot water one day, but I think that was because my daughter was washing her hair! The tank is in a cupboard on the deck, so it is easy to check the thermometer to see when it is hot again. :)\r\nI really appreciated the washer/dryer and the clothes drying rack. Keeping on top of the washing is a priority when taking an extended trip with children.\r\nThe building felt safe and secure. We didn't see another tenant, but we did chat with someone from the cafe next door and they were very friendly and helpful. We heard some music each night around dinner time. Perhaps it was the dance studio next door?? But the music was never played too late.\r\nThe loft is in a great location, near Sants station, the old bullfighting ring that has been turned into a mall, the Montjuic fountain. I recommend walking to the top of the stairs at Placa de les Cascades for the amazing view.

The location is really good, easy to get to great tourist place, and only 5 mins to metro station! 10/15 mins to train station, 15/20 to airport !! The house is very clean; with all the stuff we need for cooking, we cook four times !! Very nice place to stay . The only one thing to pick is the air circulation, but that might because of  we, as Asian, don't get used to warmer .

Não houve  nenhuma retratação apesar do airbnb devolver 20 euros para nós.\nO quarto superior tem o teto baixo, assim como o banheiro, isso deveria ser informado. Ninguém maior que 1.55 metros consegue usar esses ambientes confortavelmente. A chave de energia caiu várias vezes e a água quente acabava após 2 pessoas tomarem banho, ninguém nos explicou nada sobre.\nA calefação é em grande parte feira com ar condicionado split inverter que adicionalmente havia um sensor de presença para desligar, ou seja o importante aqui é economizar e não dar conforto ao usuário.  Nos deixaram duas chaves da casa mas somente uma funcionava.A calefação dos banheiros estava quebrada e não arrumaram mesmo após nossa queixa.

It is a quiet relaxing flat, far enough out of the centre to offer relaxing pauses in your stay, but just two minutes walk from a metro stop that has you in any number of locations in 10mins. You also have the advantage of having the exquisite Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya only 10mins walk away (plus a few additional steps)! An immediate local supermarket and pharmacy are on hand to the flat alongside many shops and restaurants within a few minutes walk, including Arenas de Barcelona for larger roof-top restaurants with an excellent view and even a cinema if needed. \n\nOur check in and check out experience were very easy with a wonderful host who gave lots of tips and stayed in touch throughout our stay. Late check out was very easily arranged for a small additional fee. The flat was spotlessly clean and is very well equipped for cooking if needed, which helps when travelling with children and the washer /drier is a also a useful addition. One bathroom has a large walk in shower, the other bathroom has a small bath and much lower shower, suitable for children and smaller adults. Any taller guests will need to share the downstairs shower. We had one or two minor requests during our visit for light bulbs and plugs etc and these were answered quickly. We visited out of season and the flat was warm and cosy. Lovely crisp white bedding is provided along with memory foam pillows and excellent mattresses / duvets - we slept well!\n\nThe street entrance to the complex is easy to find and well lit and the complex and wider local area feel extremely safe and welcoming. Entrance to the flat is on the ground floor so no major staircases or lifts required.  Be aware if travelling with older or disabled guests that there is a small external step up to the apartment entrance and one step within the apartment down to the nearest bedroom and bathroom. The second bedroom in the flat is up a small flight of stairs as seen in the flat photos. This didn't stop my older parents enjoying the flat, but it is not fully accessible. There are some works being done on the complex that temporarily make the second entrance to the flat darker, this is no problem for safety but visibility outside the flat door is a little restricted at night.\n\nOverall we had a brilliant stay in Barcelona at Loft Miro with warm hospitality and good amenities, we hope you do too!"},{"_id":"401638396","date":{"$date":"2019-01-15T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5189747","reviewer_id":"23451671","reviewer_name":"Abdullatif","comments":"Great location livable and stylish property minutes walk to plaza Espanya and a shopping mall away from the touristic district lots of shops and grocery stores  a great place to chill and live around the locals"},{"_id":"403999728","date":{"$date":"2019-01-22T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5189747","reviewer_id":"235731112","reviewer_name":"Nicolas","comments":"Super appartement bien situé, agréable et bien décoré.

I had no cell service (TMobile) and the wifi was very weak/slow.  \r\nTo be fair, waking up in the bedroom in the morning I had the real feeling like I was inside the jungle - lush plants surrounding screen windows.

If you're after a sterile/super clean hotel type environment, then this lodge may not be for you. But if you're excited for a true Hawaiian country experience, then this place is perfect. \r\n\r\nThe mattress comfort leaves something to be desired, but you should be up early doing stuff anyways. Overall we definitely felt we got great value for $ spent.\r\n\r\nA few additional comments/tips:\r\n- Check surf conditions if you're looking for a place to swim (the surf in this area can pound you).\r\n- The shared WIFI connection was speedy enough for us to watch \"The Hawaiian\" (a documentary about Eddie Aikau) on Netflix before checking out Waimea Bay. \r\n- Try pie @ Ted's Bakery (down the road).\r\n- The food trucks down the street are great - especially the Thai.\r\n- Sunset @ Sunset Beach is beautiful.\r\n- Bring a mosquito coil if you want to use the Lanai in the evening.\r\n- If the neighbour's farm cat is still a regular visitor give her a pat from us...we named (her) Felix.

It's rustic, intimate and one-of-a-kind.\n\nIt gets 4 out of 5 stars for the following reasons: \n\n1. I'm not freaked out by the bugs that we found (i.e. dead cockroach by bed, millipedes, mosquitoes) but somebody who wasn't a fan of them, may find this place a little too crowded for their taste. \nBecause the house is tucked back into the jungle, it's humid and I think that makes the smell of glasses and the fridge a little ripe.  \n\n2. Our host didn't have the Wifi up and running for the first two days, due to an unpaid bill which made it difficult to communicate and plan our days ahead.  She was apologetic and got it working on day 2.\n\n3. Definitely need a car or other mode of transportation if you plan on doing more than just hitting the beach.

The top floor has an spacious deck with a gorgeous view, and the kitchen has everything you need to prepare meals. Also there is a very cute and friendly cat who kept us company! Some amenities listed in the description were not available as far as I could tell(tv/dvds/bikes/snorkel equipment). Not a huge deal for us - no tv meant I read more of my book! - but I mention it in case these are important factors for others when booking.

Overall, it was a good experience and the view is amazing. \n\nHowever, there were a few things about the place we think should be communicated to other guests. Honestly, these were not show stoppers for us, but you should know what you're getting into before you book.\n\n1) Some of the wine glasses were dirty and we had to clean some of the dishes to use them. The place wasn't dirty, but we kept finding kitchen items that needed cleaned before using them.\n\n2) There were some holes in the screens and under the doors, so bugs and lizards could move in and out of the lodge easily. We cleaned up all dishes and food after each use to reduce the amount of bugs, which helped, but bugs and lizards all over the place inside the lodge are inevitable.\n\n3) The description states there are pets on the property, but it does not explain how much the pet (cat) is around. We couldn't enjoy the patio without the cat trying to climb on the table or our laps. It was sweet and cute, but annoying. Also, the cat broke into the lodge through a screen on our last day and every time we put it outside it would come back inside and try to jump on the bed. Again, nice cat but neither one of us wanted it playing in our suitcases or bed.\n\n4) Owner was responsive but a little slow to multiple attempts to ask about the farm fresh produce basket. The description makes it sound like those produce baskets are readily available and they are not...if we would have known that we had to order these in advance, we would have done that because we were pretty excited to try it and support local farms."},{"_id":"178136062","date":{"$date":"2017-08-04T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5194434","reviewer_id":"5671960","reviewer_name":"Justine","comments":"I rented the farmhouse apartment for two girlfriends as my family and I stayed in Meleana's other beach front pipeline house, just a block away.

Meleana was super friendly and helpful (thanks for the tidepool tip!!) and we liked the cat visiting us! It reminded us of home. There were a couple of minor issues. Firstly the roosters crow all night so bring your earplugs. Secondly, there was no way of locking the house. Even though it is very safe it made us a bit uncomfortable to have our passports in the house unprotected. If we lost them it would be a major drama.

To say we enjoyed our stay is a massive understatement. It was glorious. The peace and serenity, the view...unparalleled. We had the feeling of being completely alone in a rainforest yet in close proximity to the beaches, cafes, grocery, etc. in just 2-3 minutes time. Our bed was incredibly comfortable and the bedding stayed feeling and smelling as fresh as if it were just pulled from the wash. Mele either has magic detergent or maybe it is from being line-dried with the freshest island air possible? We came in celebration of our 22nd anniversary. We wanted a place that appealed equally to us both as my husband is an avid surfer and prefers oceanfront, whereas I love the ocean but prefer privacy and nature as well. This couldn't have matched better if we had designed it ouselves. Many oceanfront homes along the best surf spots must contend with the sounds of the road as well.  Here we somehow only heard ocean and nature even with the road in between. Magical! I poured over the reviews before booking this and have to chuckle at some that I read after experiencing it. Will you hear roosters? Sure- it is Hawaii and they are abundant. Someone suggested bringing earplugs. It would be almost criminal to plug your ears from the sound of the oceans waves rolling in while simultaneously hearing birds chirp and an occasional rooster crow. It was an experience I hadn't been lucky enough to yet stumble upon and we have lived in 7 different states and traveled frequently. I have one hesitance in writing such a positive review and it is that more people may book and it would be harder to get into next time.

Meleana was very quick to respond and couldn't have been more accommodating with her recommendations and suggestions. Some people said there are a lot of bugs, though, I'll be honest, I didn't really see any inside the home aside from the occasional gnat or moth, but it is Hawaii and you are in the country so to speak, so it really wasn't an issue at all. All in all, I'd highly recommend this spot if you're planning on visiting Oahu."},{"_id":"300709945","date":{"$date":"2018-08-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5194434","reviewer_id":"16862136","reviewer_name":"Jacob","comments":"The location of this place on a hill overlooking to beach is incredible.

It’s a wet tropical climate—so buggy during rainy season, but if you keep the doors closed the mosquitoes are limited inside. It’s just a quick hike down the hill to Pipeline and amazing surf if you enjoy a good beach for surf watching, sunrise/sunset walks or just chilling with a good book, as there are relatively few people around. (Not a swimming beach or good for kids—in the water as the surf is big and there is a current that runs along the shoreline.) The lodge house overlooks the working farm and the produce that is in season is available for purchase—so take advantage of fresh veggies and fruit. Unit is well stocked with amenities and all the folks who work on/around the farm are very friendly. Overall lovely visit and very friendly owner/family and all the friends around.

We loved the views over the farm and the ocean beyond from the deck; the beautiful jungle backdrop outside the bedroom window; the 5-minute walk down the hill to Pipeline; the convenience of being just a few minutes drive away from Pupukea and Waimea Bay  in one direction and Kahuku and Malaekahana in the other; the assortment of organic produce we bought at the Waihuena farm stand and the lodge's ample kitchen and big gas grill. We also really appreciated the ceiling fans in the bedroom, living room, and kitchen -- in addition to the breeze coming through from the deck, these kept the house airy and comfortable. Windows were well screened, keeping the mosquitoes outside. WiFi was great and there was a good desk for working. Meleana, Stacy, and everyone we met at the farm made us feel welcomed."},{"_id":"340117031","date":{"$date":"2018-10-22T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5194434","reviewer_id":"27014823","reviewer_name":"Tobias","comments":"Perfect Location\nBeautiful Jungle-Appartment\nAmazing Terrace\nLovely Cat\nCool Bicycles\nFriendly Dad"},{"_id":"341412621","date":{"$date":"2018-10-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5194434","reviewer_id":"18012965","reviewer_name":"Amy","comments":"We had a great stay.

Some things I didn’t love so much were the screens.  The desperately  need changing.. some are held in by tape and bugs come in. Also, they were out of mosquito coils and I got badly eaten. When I asked the host about it she told me to goto the store and buy some bc she wouldn’t be able to do it. I understand people get busy but it would have been nice to at least be greeted when we arrived. I never actually met the host just the housekeeper when we showed up to check it a bit early and it wasn’t ready. When I asked about a little later checkout she was kind of rude over text. Also, the shower head is a step above a hose spicket.\n Once I bought more coils I could enjoy the home more even though it felt like I was camping. And the SWEETEST kitty comes and visits .

My 14 year old son and I booked a last min trip to Oahu without any reservation. We knew we wanted to stay around the north shore for a few days. I requested the reservations 2 hour before dark for 2 nights.  Meleana responded within mins which was wonderful. I wish I had read her check in instruction. which stated every detail on how to get to the farm house from the main road because we completely lost reception a few blocks away.  No worry’s we just came back to the main highway and call meleana she was happy to give us direction back up. Right before we arrived we stopped at foodland just 1mile away for a few breakfast items for the next morning. The kitchen was well  equipped with a beautiful view of the ocean, very nice pans and a Vitamix for your smoothly lovers out there!!  Meleana did let us know about the  mosquitoes since we were a couple blocks inland. The first night no bites, going into the second night after it rained a few came out which we didnt mind since we were coming in and out the front porch.  My son and I wanted to  experience Oahu without our normal resort vacations. Saying at the farmhouse absolutely made us feel like I was living here for years.

There are many little galleries, lifestyle/interior stores, intriguing boutiques and even candy stores to explore around his place (tips: you can leave your shopping bags at home and hit the streets again). It is also very close to famous noodle restaurants in Wellington St, and just opposite a popular beef noodles restaurant. \r\n\r\nI like it that Tom's place is really quiet and calm at night, great for having a beer on the balcony, and watching movies on his HUGE TV (Tom's got some really cool movies). His place is also very tasteful, minimalist and spacious, so for this price, beats ANY tiny Hong Kong hotels in Hong Kong Island or Kowloon area. And Tom was not joking about his world class steam iron.\r\n\r\nMy only regret is not being able to meet Tom in person as i was late and made some bad transport decisions. It is best to walk to Tom's house if you do not have that much luggage, as traffic jams + narrow roads + other tourists lining up for taxis can cause tremendous delay.

The flat is spacious and offers everything we could wish for. And the location is even better, everyone we met confirmed us how lucky we were to stay in this area. The only downside was that some of the best places around where closed because of the lunar new year, so instead of people queuing for the noodle shop downstairs we saw many disappointed faces looking at the closed sign, including us… I guess that is good to know if you are planning to visit Hong Kong. But as you see there isn’t even one downside which is actually related to Tom or the flat.

This was the first time that I stayed in a place where, from the sheer amount of personal belongings, I had the impression that the apartment is inhabited when not rented out. The result of this is that every cupboard, wardrobe and drawer is full of personal stuff. Not really what I wanted or expected. I do not have a problem with this but it would have been good to know. The photos do paint a good picture of the apartment but what they don't show, and the listing does not clarify, is that this is a ground floor apartment in an old building, with no blinds/curtains, that backs onto an alley way (with bright street lighting) that forms an entrance way into the high school next door. On weekdays, it can be noisy as the kids arrive/depart the school as well as during the break times. \n\nOn a positive note, Tam is a great host and very communicative. He immediately worked to darken the bedroom for me (thanks Tam!) and is very conscientious that his guests are comfortable. The bed is extremely comfortable, towels are soft and fluffy and the location is second to none. The shower is also very good. \n\nValue for money?

This contributed to make many everyday things work easy for a NYC-rookie as me - and make me feel completely safe and secure during my stay.\r\n\r\nThe apartment is homey, comfortable and unique. I love the art and brick wall. It had what I needed during my stay - nice light/bright bathroom, kitchen facility, nice big bed, closet/drawer space for my clothing, couch, AC to beat the heat, wifi and (bonus!) loudspeakers to play music.\r\n\r\nYorkville is a very charming neighborhood. East 87th Street is pleasantly quiet, however, near busy streets where you can find good restaurants and grocery stores. I loved charming Carl Schurz Park located by the East River, just two blocks away (Tara's recommendation!). \r\nI have enjoyed my stay in Tara's home very much!

This being my first Airbnb experience I didn't know quite what to expect, but Isabella was always prompt in responding to my various questions and requests.  Her place is accessible to public transportation and and the neighborhood is very safe.  My mom and I stayed there for an extended amount of time and felt like true locals.  I did encounter a problem returning the keys though.  The Keycafe service used for key exchange didn't recognize the fob on the keys and I was stuck there trying to figure it out while I had my mom waiting in a cab with the meter running to go to the airport.  I called the Keycafe customer service number and after 30 minutes was able to get one of the drawers unlocked so I can deposit the keys.

It's a small apartment but does not feel cramped at all. It feels bigger than it looks. We've stayed many times in new York and we were surprised how quiet it was, and heard very little of the noise a big city makes.\n\nThe apartment got everything you need. And with the new Q train you can quickly get to midtown and the sights. Central park is close and we walked there several times. Everything you need is also just around the corner being a convenience store, restaurant, bars..\n\nWe never got to meet our lovely host but she kept in contact and made sure we had everything we needed.

Jose never did meet me, in fact, I never received a response to my questions because there was nobody at reception when I tried to contact them. That said, it is a nice hotel. It is clean, well located, and reasonably priced. It is well stocked, but, since it is a hotel, everything has a price - tea, coffee, water, etc.... None of the friendly touches that you find in many AirBnB rentals. Although it does have what you would expect from a hotel: soap, shampoo, lotion, towels, TV, internet, and more. During business hours the reception desk has a host, but it can be difficult if you arrive outside of business hours. The woman at reception on the morning after our arrival was very clear that this is a hotel, and was surprised that we were surprised. The location is good, two blocks from the Sagrada Familia, and the Blue Line bus stop, as well as the metro. The restaurants nearby are, consequently, generally touristy. We have an 11 year old and felt comfortable with the lodging and the neighborhood.

Being an airbnb host and also traveling pretty much primarily through airbnb I would highly recommend staying away - or accepting that this is not really an airbnb type property. \r\n\r\nThis is an apartment hotel that the owner listed (Jose Castro) will never answer your messages, in fact, he doesn't even answer airbnb staff. Upon arrival we were greeted by a receptionist at the hotel that asked us for a credit card for guarantee (going against airbnb terms) and 30 Euro for parking. We were also informed the elevator was broken and \"probably\" won't be fixed. It wasn't. Jose would not answer our calls or airbnb staff. Having parked in a garage in minus 4 level we had to drag our suitcases up those 4 flights and then another 3 to our apartment. (the apartment itself is very nice). \r\n\r\nWhen we checked out there was a different lady at reception and when asked about the elevator we were told it was working. Great news... Only problem, turns out she never knew it was broken so we got stuck in the elevator and had to crawl out in between floors. \r\n\r\nTo recap, worst airbnb experience ever. If someone wants an apartment hotel, look online and find a better deal. \r\n\r\nAlso, the photo showing the sagrada familia - that is not from the room and you have no access to that patio... \r\n"},{"_id":"33059847","date":{"$date":"2015-05-25T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"524729","reviewer_id":"5456987","reviewer_name":"Kristina","comments":"The apartment itself was same as photos described.

First this began with 'Jose' refusing to reply to four of my messages during the two weeks before we arrived. When we did arrive there was no reservation in my name even though we had paid - thankfully the receptionist was extremely useful and found a free apartment. \r\n\r\nInside the apartment was OK, but no where near the finish I expected from the photos. Bedrooms are extremely small and we had a lot of damage to floors, chairs, side boards and other pieces of furniture. This was topped off by the air-con being broken (constantly set at 24 degrees!) and WiFi not working, we asked for each of these problems to be solved, but sadly 'Jose' and his team were unable to meet out expectations. Also, watch out for the water strategically placed near your beds, which will cost you 5 EUROS! if you drink it. This is not what I would ever expect from an airbnb.\r\n\r\nFinally, there was that roof terrace shown in the picture with the view of Sagrada Familia in the first picture. This picture is actually from a different building that holds the spa and gym. The apartment's roof terrace actually has a view of the cathedral that is 90% blocked by a concrete building, but thankfully they have painted a picture of Sagrada Familia on the side of the picture so you can still see something.....\r\n\r\nMain positive from our stay - the SPA and gym, this is EXCELLENT! Probably because it is not owned or management by 'Jose' and his team."},{"_id":"69967898","date":{"$date":"2016-04-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"524729","reviewer_id":"14269911","reviewer_name":"Angel Emilio","comments":"La ubicación y el apartamento geniales, el SPA muy bueno (está en el edificio contiguo)"},{"_id":"70226140","date":{"$date":"2016-04-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"524729","reviewer_id":"59283658","reviewer_name":"Jean Philippe","comments":"très bon acceuil, appartement conforme aux photos, quartier agréable"},{"_id":"71238194","date":{"$date":"2016-04-24T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"524729","reviewer_id":"52246470","reviewer_name":"Mario","comments":"Good place.

Lovely apartment, but location and \"luxury\" feel was lacking. Also, the website said \"penthouse apartment\" for rent, not the 1st floor.. Bit of a disappointment. Be more specific in the OWNER's space's description. Fridge never really got cold, and coffee was €1/K-cup, which is kinda ridiculous considering the setting went for. Also, looks over a very loud playground/kindergarten, so don't expect to sleep in too much on a weekday, or in summer for that matter.

Unless if you’re willing to whisper and move around extremely carefully as most things are fragile and about to break. When we arrived, many things were half broken. One of the wooden doors with a glass pane were accidently broken, the glass pane was extremely thin and weak, and broke upon the slightest of impact. The receptionist ensured us that the cost would not be much at all, because they have had many cases like this. We were told that the cost would be nothing to worry about, but the next day we were given a scrap piece of paper with the amount 530 Euros written on it. After being told that the price would be ‘very small’, we were extremely shocked that such a cheap piece of glass could cost so much. It would genuinely cost me less to fly over a repairs company from London to fix the glass and then return back home, than pay 530 Euros. We were then told that they would give us the specifications of the glass so that we could find a replacement ourselves, as even they agreed that the price was extortionate. However, we received no information and upon leaving we were told that the money had already been charged to my credit card, without any invoice, despite asking multiple times for this. I am extremely confused, and feel exploited, as 530 euros could not possibly be the genuine cost of the repair, and feel as though they are profiting out of this incident, as we only received a piece of paper with the number 530 written on it, without any break down. All in all, a very unprofessional team, which is such a shame because the apartments were otherwise quite nice, and in a good location.  \r\nThe owner of the apartments, Jose, is very slow with communicating. Even now, I have received a notification that he has written me a review, however he has not replied to my message on AirBNB from the day of the incident, asking to speak with us regarding the problem. All in all, a very bad experience, and I will not be returning. \r\n"},{"_id":"95249972","date":{"$date":"2016-08-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"524729","reviewer_id":"2181134","reviewer_name":"Leonid","comments":"The description of the place is completely misleading. There is NOTHING exclusive about it - a completely average apartment with quite visible wear and tear - dirty walls in some places, particularly in the kitchen, large chunks of paint scratched off the walls in other places. The smaller bedrooms are tiny and feel cramped. The photo of the shared roof is just as misleading - it is just a small outdoor space, not a spacious one that the skillfully taken picture makes you believe it is. The worst thing is that THERE IS NO GYM in the building and THERE IS NO POOL. It is a lie - there is a commercial fitness center in the next building to which you can get a pass to only if you are smart enough to ask for it while there is someone at the reception. They do not just give it to you by default, undoubtedly trying to save money. So when you return in the evening and there is noone at the reception you are screwed. The gym does not let you in and calling the contact number provided does not help - the operator just tells you that there is nothing that she can do and that you would have to use the gym TOMORROW. The seemingly reasonable argument that you have already paid to use it today falls on deaf ears. s the incident with not being able to get into gym showed, the host was completely unresponsive. Upon my demand to speak to the manager or the owner, the operator called them and in the end told me that there is nothing that can be done now and that nobody would be willing to speak to me. She obviously consulted with someone so it was a conscious decision on their part not to speak to the client. Moreover the next day when I complained to the person who is in the building during the day, she replied that it was MY FAULT and that it was me who should have thought of asking for the passes to the fitness center when I checked into the apartment! To summarize: the words used in the description - \"comfort, location, sustainability and modernity are the perfect definition for this exclusive residences concept in Barcelona\" have nothing to do with the reality. The place itself is not dirty but because of dirt on the walls and scratched paint it does not feel very clean either - just average. Independently, one expects that an \"exclusive\" apartment would have not only the washing machine, but the detergent as well. Also basics like salt and pepper are not too much to ask for. The location is not bad, but more appealing on the map than in reality. Because it is so close to Sagrada Familia there are too many tourists around, while the benefits of being close to it are limited, as other main attractions are in other parts of the city.

So I strongly advice you make sure you won't be move to the second one. They told me the first location is full when I arrive and need us to stay in another location, believe me, you will not be willing to stay in that area. Location is one of the most critical reasons we select this apartment and we paid for that, can't believe they think it's ok to arrange us to the other location. (we went back to the main location after I insisted to cancel my booking if we can't move back to the main one). Their main apartment is fine, except it can barely fit into 6 people as the 3rd room is extremely small. 必须用中文提醒下中国同胞,他们有两个地点,一定不会被他们发配到郊区的那个,一定要求呆在圣家堂旁边的那个,同时,前台的那个女的服务态度简直差到极致,如果你觉着被不友好的接待,我们千万也别给她好脸色看"},{"_id":"107414503","date":{"$date":"2016-10-10T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"524729","reviewer_id":"79847324","reviewer_name":"Jennifer","comments":"apartment was clean,  spacious and very central. \nWe absolutely loved our stay.

The host provided a very special courtesy to us which shall remain confidential, however it was particularly trustworthy on his part which we appreciate so much. Very good value for the price. We recommend wholeheartedly. There is a tax that you have to pay on the room which is nominal but unexpected, I think it's just a Spain or Barcelona rule. Early check-in, if available, comes with a fee that is not unreasonable however we didn't know about it ahead of time.

My property manager Martin has been the one who has been answering your questions and in communication with you.  He takes care of my home and bookings while I am away at sea for work.  It is strange to write about myself but here goes.   I am a bit of everything, but at heart I'm a sailor. By being a sailor I can do the things that I love the most. I like to travel the world on my time off. To see, smell, feel and experience what I don't know and sometimes don't understand .  I am an avid reader and a complete science fiction freak, I actually subscribe to sci fi/fantasy magazine. Reading is my zen to chill and relax. I love exotic and different food while drinking yummy wine.  It helps loving the outdoors because I can burn off what I eat. I enjoy, hiking, camping, surfing, snorkeling, diving. Anything that is on or surrounded by ocean or forest makes me happiest.  I make friends easily and love spending time with cool and interesting people.  What drives me, is moving forward and always learning something new.  \"you can never cross the ocean unless you have courage to lose sight of the shore.\"     ","host_response_time":"within an hour","host_thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/0965a377-22f1-4dba-bfc8-0b48ab1ccdd0.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","host_picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/0965a377-22f1-4dba-bfc8-0b48ab1ccdd0.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","host_neighbourhood":"Island of Hawaiʻi","host_response_rate":90,"host_is_superhost":false,"host_has_profile_pic":true,"host_identity_verified":true,"host_listings_count":1,"host_total_listings_count":1,"host_verifications":["email","phone","reviews","jumio","offline_government_id","government_id"]},"address":{"street":"Captain Cook, HI, United States","suburb":"Island of Hawaiʻi","government_area":"South Kona","market":"The Big Island","country":"United States","country_code":"US","location":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-155.87575,19.31694],"is_location_exact":true}},"availability":{"availability_30":4,"availability_60":34,"availability_90":64,"availability_365":185},"review_scores":{"review_scores_accuracy":10,"review_scores_cleanliness":9,"review_scores_checkin":10,"review_scores_communication":10,"review_scores_location":9,"review_scores_value":9,"review_scores_rating":90},"reviews":[{"_id":"42718779","date":{"$date":"2015-08-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5249793","reviewer_id":"11074422","reviewer_name":"Nils","comments":"This is a beautiful house for a family vacation or for staying with a few friends (there is plenty of space).

You can only see one roof from the back deck, so it feels very private \u0026 isolated.  However neighbors were close enough to check on us in a heavy rain, and help us with garbage on the way out of town!\r\n\r\nHouse is far enough down in South Kona that it is fairly rural.  Stores are a ways out.  Garbage is not collected on site, and needs to be dropped off at the dump station (easy enough to do, we just had cars full of luggage upon departure, so very friendly neighbor offered to take our garbage on his next trip).\r\n\r\nWater for the house is on a catchment system, so conservation is of the essence.  We came from California (currently having our 5th year of drought), so conserving was not hard.  Plus it was rainy season, so there was plenty of water while we were there!\r\n\r\nDeck is lovely, and truly the most inviting part of the house.  The rest of the house is nice and comfortable, but the outdoors beckon when your in Hawaii!  House is comfortable.  Fans in all bedrooms.  Kitchen is well equipped and has most everything you could need.  I wish we would have stopped by the house before shopping, because there was quite a bit of groceries (that seemed to be from previous visitors).  We ended up leaving some groceries like previous visitors did.  It's Hawaii so there are bugs, gecko's etc. so keeping doors \u0026 window screens shut is critical for your own comfort!\r\n\r\nLovely!  Comfortable!

The size of the space was great. We used all three bedrooms and both bathrooms. The lanai is beautiful especially in the early hours of the morning. Fair warning that there is a big mosquito issue in this area of the island from the consistent sun/rain/overcast each day and lush greenery. We did not get to enjoy the lanai too much for that reason. Simin provides lots of mosquito candles but the mosquitoes are vicious. Our husbands tuffed it out and grilled battling the mosquitos. Simin's book is very helpful at explaining but maybe add to the listing description too.\n\nThe house is on a roof water catchment system which we didn't remember seeing in the listing description. Luckily we had plenty of rain to make sure we didn't run out of water for showers, dishes, etc. Simin's book explains the system. Drinking water can be bought/refilled at the market. Also, trash has to be taken to the local dump 15 minutes away. This was a bit difficult with our group and rental car size. We were not able to take trash on our last day and Simin was kindly good with that. \n\nThe driveway and general area of this part of the island is steep, with curving highways. Be prepared to return at reasonable hours before sunset as the highway is also very curvy and dark. Also, restaurants, gas, and market are about a 20-30 minute drive away. They do close early so plan ahead. We enjoyed the Choice Market selection and Keoki's Ono Fish n Chips is the best! \n\nKona is a good hour drive. Hilo closer to 2 hours. Volcano park 1.5 hours. 30 minutes or less to most of the coffee farms. \n\nThe drive to the pebble beach is very steep. I don't recommend walking unless you are in very, very good shape. The area of the house is very safe and also secluded. The avocado tree in front is beautiful, \n\nWindow coverings in the future would be nice. We often watched movies at night and are from the City, so it felt about odd to not have curtains. But the windows do let in a lot of natural light during the day. The master room faces the lanai. If you have a big group, privacy can be an issue. \n\nMore fans would be nice. We bought our own. We had a few very warm days and lost power for we think about 30 minutes but luckily we were already heading to the beach. We kept windows and doors closed to keep out the bugs. They did often sneak in through the screens if not closed.\n\nOverall, we enjoyed our adventurous stay and appreciated Simin's communication and book. We definitely had a memorable stay and the house was a perfect size for our group of five. Thanks, Simin.\n\n "},{"_id":"195988706","date":{"$date":"2017-09-21T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5249793","reviewer_id":"34007174","reviewer_name":"Parees","comments":"The host canceled this reservation 9 days before arrival.

We had five people with us and it was plenty big enough to a accommodate our needs. We loved the big Lanai and sat out there most mornings and evenings. The outdoor eating spots are wonderful. The view is spectacular! There are plenty of things in the kitchen to use for prepping meals and a propane grill outside as well. Simon provides many various beach supplies as well. The pebble beach at the end of the road as well as the “hidden” beach are Both really pretty.

The closest sandy beach is a quick 10 minute drive where we swam and watched dolphins. \nIf you’re looking for a secluded retreat ... this place is for you.

When you first drive up you might be confused because all you see at first is a very small building. That's just the gym! The whole house is quite large and is down below the workout shed. The porch is quite large and gorgeous. The first thing we did when we arrived was to crack some beers and lounge in the hammock and porch swing which look out on the water less than a mile below. The porch is surrounded by various colorful, flowering trees and avocado trees. It feels very lush. The vegetation completely blocks any visual of the neighbors so it took me a while realize there was a house on one side of us. We could hear them sometimes but it wasn't annoying. The house has a lot of extras that made our vacation special. The grill was crucial - we used it almost every night and it made dinners so easy and delicious, and clean up was a breeze. We ate out on the porch every night, and then played cards or just talked. The fridge is full of condiments so you probably won't need to worry about shelling out for long-lasting extras like ketchup, mayo, mustard, hot sauce, etc. There is a drip coffee maker AND a french press for coffee snobs. Beyond the kitchen, there is a lot of beach/water gear: Several sets of snorkels with fins; two beach chairs (one is a little worse for wear but usable); two beach umbrellas, a cooler and beach towels. You might need to sort through the snorkel gear a bit to make sure you're getting the good stuff, since a couple of the masks are broken. A couple of us still rented gear at Snorkel Bob's because we wanted to go several times and couldn't get a good fit with any of the masks at the house, but two of us just used the house gear the whole time. I wasted space in my suitcase on beach towels, since this place had solid ones on offer. Most notable of all, though, was the friendly and communicative demeanor of Simin and her property manager, Martin. Soon after my reservation, Simin let me know that the sink in the guest bathroom wasn't working, though she hoped to have it repaired before we arrived. Shortly before we arrived, she let me know that the sink was still broken, and offered us a generous discount without any negotiation on my part. I received a text message from Martin on the day we were supposed to arrive, and then he was refilling the water tank at the property when we arrived, and was helpful and friendly. Then, toward the end of our visit, I realized that I had overbooked our stay, so we were paying for an extra night after our flight back to the mainland! I sent Simin a message and she immediately responded, refunding me that night of our stay. She didn't..."},{"_id":"329423144","date":{"$date":"2018-09-28T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5249793","reviewer_id":"18738949","reviewer_name":"Ashley","comments":"I had mixed feelings about this place. The house definitely has its own character. The layout and amenities were awesome for the most part and the outdoor space was so inviting. The location was also central to the activities were were planning for the trip. There were a couple things that made the experience less than desirable. The outdoor patio would have been a great place to spend a good amount of our time, but the mosquitoes were out 24/7. Bug spray/citronella didn't help, those guys were vicious! So despite the patio being one of the main reasons we booked the house, we couldn't really use it :( Also, everything in the kitchen has a thin coating of dirt/grime. All the pots/pans/utensils/shelves etc were dirty.  Another downside to our stay was there was a leak prior to our arrival that caused us limited use of the second bathroom and one of the bedrooms. Martin was kind enough to warn us prior to our arrival, but it wasn't a desirable situation. The last thing, which isn't much of a criticism, but just unexpected was the windows in the master bedroom don't have shades, so be prepared to get up with the sun (and the neighbors roosters and dogs). Value-wise, not great compared to other rentals we've had in the area, especially since two rooms were out of order, but that's obliviously subjective. Other than that, this place is pretty much as described...country living, in a central location, with a great view."},{"_id":"338919384","date":{"$date":"2018-10-20T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5249793","reviewer_id":"208823256","reviewer_name":"Jesper","comments":"A magnificent place.

Easy access as long as you're good with a few stairs and we loved the combo lock instead of having a key. Filtered water for drinking and hot water works great.

I'l","neighborhood_overview":"Within a few blocks of the apartment, you'll discover the many reasons that Williamsburg has become the global definition of \"cool\".  At the famous Nitehawk Cinema, you can watch movies while being served brunch. At local coffee shops, like Devocion, Toby's Estate, and Blue Bottle, you can hang out with more hipsters than probably where else in the world. The nightlife is probably Williamsburg's strongest feature, with several excellent cocktail bars nearby (I especially like Hotel Delmano and Maison Premiere), many options for live music, as well as the two best nightclubs in NYC (Verboten and Output). In summer, there's the outdoor foodie market Smorgasburg. There's excellent shopping at unique boutiques: escape the chain stores and global luxury labels that now dominate Manhattan.","notes":"","transit":"The Bedford stop on the L train is a 10 minute walk away. From Bedford, it's 1 stop into Manhattan; you can be in Union Square in 5 minutes.  Most of the major tourist sites are easily accessible. From the Bedford L station, Times Square is about 15 minutes. However, I always recommend that visitors spend as little time as possible in the main tourist areas in midtown, and I'm happy to provide recommendations for the areas where locals hang out.  If you'd prefer not to take the subway, there is a constant supply of Uber cars in the neighborhood, as well as regular New York taxis.","access":"In addition to your private area, the apartment also includes a large chef's kitchen with new appliances (perfect for cooking and making tea and coffee), a dining table, and a large sitting area with a high-end sound and entertainment system.

Our paths crossed three or four times over our stay and he always had a pleasant word or a recommendation about what to see or do\r\nThe apartment was in fact better than the description on line - really airy and bright and our room (with its en-suite) was great. As we were on a road trip it was good to have plenty of wardrobe space to hang clothes. Also as an aside his broadband speed was lightening quick - 45 mb/s. \r\nThe neighbourhood of Williamsburgh is up and  coming and trendy with every one wired to either their phone, tablet or laptop. Ate out three nights locally and never felt apprehensive or concerned about walking home afterwards - really pleasant. \r\nWe loved staying with Andy for all the above reasons but also, for us personally were the views of Manhatten from the park at the bottom of his road (100 metres).  The classic sky line just laid there in front of you - way better than staying IN Manhatten. The same applied to using the East river ferry ($4) to upper or lower Manhatten, a 10 minute walk and way better views than being sat on the subway.

Not that I would have minded if we'd seen each other more — he's polite and welcoming, and I felt at ease in his home. The location is excellent; it's about a 10-minute walk to the L-train to get into Manhattan, and the surrounding neighborhood is lined with cool restaurants, bars, and shops.

The house was so beautiful and fully renovated. I really enjoyed the high ceilings and stunning kitchen - made cooking at home feel like a vacation too. The home got a great breeze (so long as you open all the windows) and the rooms were comfortable and relaxing. The house had many authentic emblems of Hawaiian culture and waterman sports as well as the owner's family decorated through out it. The town in Kailua was bustling and we were only 10 minutes away from Lanakai Beach. I did window shopping and picked up some nice snorkeling gear in town too. The grocery store (Foodlands) offers yummy poke (which I had for lunch nearly everyday) and I was in love with the local fruit flavored mochi balls (with ice cream filling). The property manager - Vai was welcoming and I only really reached out to her when I first got there but she gave us some great advice on where to eat, which beaches to get rentals from, and where to find items in the house. Between my boyfriend and myself we used our netflix, apple, and amazon IDs to watch movies and tv in the evenings (bc there is no cable) which was a perfect way to end nights when we wanted to stay in. I can't wait to bring my family here next time since the house is huge. I'd recommend this place to any friends visiting Oahu.

Short story: My wife and I traveled to Oahu 10 years ago.  We stayed in a hotel on Waikiki Beach, we largely kept to Honolulu (beaches, shopping, restaurants, etc.), we spent a lot of money, and had a miserable time.  We were determined this time to really experience all that Oahu had to offer, and generally avoid the heavy tourist areas.  Instead of the traffic and headaches of Honolulu, we opted to stay in Kailua – which turned out to be a great decision.  If you are concerned that Kailua may be too far from the action of Honolulu, don’t worry.  With the Pali Highway (Route 61), Route 72, and H3, we found ourselves only a scenic 30-minute drive from downtown Honolulu, Diamond Head, Hanauma Bay, Pearl Harbor, or the junction to North Shore.  If you don’t believe me, check out these images – this is your drive every day! (Website hidden by Airbnb) \r\n\r\nThe house we stayed in was a spacious 3-bedroom, 2-bath with a massive kitchen (the owner said there’s even a 4th bedroom if you need it, for just a little more). “Fully furnished” does not quite describe the attention to detail and valuable extras that are provided.  Snorkeling gear (check!), boogie boards (check!), ice coolers (check!), washer/dryer (check!), as well as tons of kitchenware, a massive gas grill under the carport, and more. We saved a lot of money on gear we didn’t need to rent, and saved time not having to make that extra trip to the store for “essentials.”  A flat-screen TV, Apple TV, and a nice wi-fi setup bring this vintage Hawaiian home into the digital age.  There are some great restaurants (4-star or better on Yelp, Saigon Noodle House was one of our favorites - (Website hidden by Airbnb) just a mile away in a nearby shopping center, or in downtown Kailua.  Kailua Beach and Lanakai Beach are just a short drive away, and quickly became our favorite beaches of the trip.  We got way more for our money in Kailua, and truly felt like we had been to Oahu for the first time.\r\n\r\nBottom line: If you want to sip umbrella drinks on Wakiki Beach, with a short walk back to an overpriced, tiny condo, this is not the place for you.  But if you want to feel like you are truly living in Hawaii, and experience the island from the perspective of a multi-generational Hawaiian family (the photos are right on the walls!) – with all the modern perks you would expect, I highly recommend this property."},{"_id":"52223010","date":{"$date":"2015-10-27T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5262710","reviewer_id":"7613431","reviewer_name":"Kiki","comments":"This is my family's first time in Hawaii and we had a wonderful time here!

You could tell the remodel was done with meticulous care. \r\n\r\nThe location is just a short drive from Lanikai, my girlfriend and my favorite beach on Oahu. Also nearby is Kailua beach park where you can easily rent all sorts of toys for beach activities including surf boards, stand up paddle boards, kayaks, snorkeling gear, etc. Blaine kindly offered us to use his boogie boards, snorkeling gear and beach mats, which came quite handy. \r\n\r\nI do have to say, however, that the house can get quite hot. I thought there would be air conditioning but as I had learned, it's not common to have air condition in the homes in that area. It was also unusually hot for the time of year that we stayed. Opening the windows does help a bit. Despite that, I would still definitely stay at Blaine's place again. His and Vai's hospitality helped top off our vacation! \r\n\r\nIf you're looking to get away from the busy and crowded Waikiki area, I would highly suggest staying at Tutu's Hale!

We were traveling with our two month old which required one of us to stay in the house most of the day and it was unbearably hot. It also made it impossible for us to swaddle our baby at night for fear of overheating. \r\nOverall, the condition of the house was nice except for the washer which smelled like mildew and the shower curtain liners which were dirty. \r\nIt's hard to be positive about the house when we were so uncomfortable with the heat. If we weren't traveling with such a small child, we would have done better to escape the heat by staying outside of the house all day. I think the host should warn families with babies and small children - it seemed unreasonable to expect anyone to stay inside all day with no relief from the heat. We ended up having to purchase a portable AC for our bedroom. Our host suggested to rent one but we couldn't find a company that rented out small portable air conditioners. \r\nAfter reading the reviews, I had high expectations of this house. Also, since my correspondence with Blaine months before our visit was friendly and positive, I thought for sure that our stay would be great. Unfortunately, during our stay, I didn't find him to be as friendly or helpful. Vai, the property manager, was not available for most of our stay which was not explained to us until our attempts to contact her failed our first day there. \r\n\r\nMy family loves Kailua and this neighborhood was really quiet and nice. I was really optimistic about this listing because it was reasonably priced for Kailua. Next time, I'll make sure to stay in a cooler and nicer place and make the drive if I want to go to Lanikai. \r\n"},{"_id":"91106234","date":{"$date":"2016-08-03T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5262710","reviewer_id":"47945919","reviewer_name":"Claudia","comments":"This property is amazing!

Tutu's Hale made it easy to forget that we do not actually live in Kailua.  I cannot imagine a better place to stay in Kailua, and if there is it must be Blaine's place #2.  The toiletries beat out any hotel selection.  My wife and I loved the shampoo\u0026 conditioner picks.

There is even a coffee bean grinder for those who want to know whether to purchase ground coffee or beans.  There is even a libations cabinet for those who can get through the child safety lock (which we eventually figured out).\nThere are beach toys, boogie boards, snorkels, coolers, beach mats and lawn chairs.  Everything you need for an awesome beach day!\nThe only recommendation I have is that if you have a child who is 3 and under, I would consider bringing your pak n' play for bedtime.

The house was super clean and slept all 8 of us quite comfortably.  The drive from the airport to the house was one of the highlights of our trip and was a great way to start things off (awesome views)!\n\nWe loved the local beach.  It was breathtaking and less busy than the beaches closer to the city.  The house is also very close to the pillbox hiking trail which we did twice.  We enjoyed the local restaurants in Kailua and found getting around to be easy.  We visited much of the island from Blaine's place and could reach all of our destination in under an hour.  Being from the East Coast, we often awoke early and sat in chairs in the back yard as the sun came up.  Watch out for the local kitty (I called Vincent since he was missing an ear) who likes to go behinds cars when it is dark.\n\nThe only nit picks (and they really are nit picks) is that the water pressure in one shower was a bit low and an army of slugs liked to appear in the back yard late at night and in the early morning (OK by me but the girls didn't like it!).  A boat parked opposite the drive way makes backing out a little tricky.\n\nBut the positives of this house vastly outway those little issues.  If we can return, we would absolutely stay here again!

You can tell this is a much-loved family home and we really enjoyed our stay. \n\nThe location was perfect for us - unbelievable beaches only a short drive away. The view from the garden is lovely and we realised very quickly that our decision to stay near Kailua vs the touristy Waikiki was absolutely right.  \n\nThe communication from Vai was brilliant, she was very warm, friendly and professional. She answered my questions really quickly and when an issue arose (ours) she was extremely understanding. Vai and Blaine are the epitome of the amazing hospitality that Hawaiians prides themselves on and I would really recommend staying here."},{"_id":"222090200","date":{"$date":"2017-12-28T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5262710","reviewer_id":"61218131","reviewer_name":"Iain","comments":"Spacious, comfortable and well equipped house with amazing views from the back garden ideally situated for the beautiful Kailua and Lanakai beaches.

We were very grateful for that since some of our family had 10h flight from Australia. \nWhen you enter the house you feel very welcomed. Everything was clean and nicely organized. Snacks were waiting for us- very thoughtful and nice gesture. \nThe house was perfect for 6 adults, one teenager and 15 month old. We enjoyed our morning coffee in the backyard watching sunrise. \nIt was very convenient to have a kitchen equipped with all tools for cooking, dishwasher,laundry, towels, beach toys, parking for two cars, etc. The house has many windows and high sealing -great light and the wind keeps the house very cool and comfortable. (No need for AC in April -temp. high 70s). Each room has fans too. There are books, magazines and guidebooks to plan your activities. \n\nThe neighborhood is quiet and just down the street there is Safeway and restaurants. \nFew min drive from the house are the most beautiful white sand (Website hidden by Airbnb) beautiful! \n\nWe definitely recommend this house especially if you want to escape touristy areas and be woken up by soft sound of birds.  \n\n\n\nAloha! ✨"},{"_id":"254710410","date":{"$date":"2018-04-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5262710","reviewer_id":"30868689","reviewer_name":"Sarah","comments":"Beautiful home!

I have to give some honest advice. It was a very old house, damp, dark, and terribly furnished. The host did not appear from beginning to end, only an old woman who could not speak English helped us.  We did not check in because we found the room was totally different from the picture. There is a huge, scary human models in the room. The room was unheated and the quilt smelled musty. Our room has no door lock but only a hook, and with the toilet connection. Lack of light and those scary furniture give us a sense of insecurity. That is the most important point why we left there. What made us angry is that the host didn’t feel sorry for her dishonesty about her house but think we’re unreasonable. It was the worst accommodation experience I've ever had.\n\nAs condições deste quarto não correspondem à imagem da página. A sala está húmida, escura e destrancada. \nA decoração do quarto é assustadora, e não é recomendada a entrada de raparigas. \n\n방은 실제 사진과 전혀 맞지 않았고, 매우나 쁜 경험이었기 때문에 입주 할 수 없었다.어둡고 습기 가 많고 깨끗 하지 않 으며, 매우 무섭다"},{"_id":"408355329","date":{"$date":"2019-02-04T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5283892","reviewer_id":"14784385","reviewer_name":"Juan Carlos","comments":"Excelente lugar y ejemplo claro del porqué existe Airbnb. 100% recomendado"},{"_id":"409027784","date":{"$date":"2019-02-06T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5283892","reviewer_id":"26991749","reviewer_name":"Roberta","comments":"Sofia and Maria's flat is amazing, a perfect place to start a journey in Porto.

I really wish I booked more than three nights, I could stay here forever!! Breathtaking views of ocean and lagoon directly from the whole apartment; modern appliance; spacious bedrooms and living rooms, and friendly service on site... I enjoyed every moment here during the stay. My kids had a great time playing at the lagoon, the water is very clear and not cold at all even in the morning. We dipped into the jacuzzi (which you would need the key card to get in) after playing in the beach, the swimming pool is beautiful as well (we don't have a lot of time to experience that this time, what a pity)! They also have Disney junior Chanel available, which kept my kids quiet when I was busy doing the cleaning work. \r\nPatric, the onsite manager, is very friendly, and showed us how to operate everything. Jackie, the owner, is very professional and send us all the agreement, map,  instructions ... as soon as we confirmed our stay. \r\nThe stove is a little bit slow to warm up, and it takes long for the dryer to get the work done, but that is nothing to be worried, we are not preparing a big feast or doing heavy laundry everyday. We only prepared our breakfast during the stay. There is a small plaza with dining, cafe, and market, so you don't need to worry for food. \r\nThis place is a comparatively new area, the exit from the highway leads to the entrance of the whole resort which includes 4 major groups: four season, Disney, Beach villa (where we stayed), and Marriot. It is a little bit far from Waikiki and Diamond head. The distance is OK, but we always got caught at the traffic. So be sure to allow extra time to get to those places.\r\n"},{"_id":"102083071","date":{"$date":"2016-09-16T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5288332","reviewer_id":"22772697","reviewer_name":"Fernando","comments":"Jackie's apartment is more than great.

We liked all the complementary use of sand toys, beach chair, towels, and snorkeling gear.   Jackie was easy to communicate with prior to arrival.   After we arrived, the on-site manager Patrick helped with our questions and checking us in.  The only area of improvement would be the dryer took a while to dry clothes and the stove took longer than usual to warm food....but these aren't a big deal to us.   Everything else was great.

After a long day of travel, we were so glad to be resting at Jackie's place. We had a great view of the lagoon all the way to the mountain ranges and it was a comfortable and enjoyable stay for everybody from my older parents to my 4 year old daughter and I. Everything we needed was there, from a stocked kitchen (just stop by the grocery or the nearby target if you plan to cook) and my 4 year old appreciated the step ladder that helped her reach the sink to wash her hands or climb into the comfortable beds. You could spend several days of your trip just on property, in the nearby lagoons or the community pool, though I'd also recommend renting a car and seeing some of the beautiful mountain scenery nearby. Thank you Jackie, for being a part of our memorable Hawaii trip.

Our family typically goes to Hawaii once a year, alternating between Maui and Oahu. If you're like us and want to avoid the more touristy spots like Waikiki, I would definitely recommend Ko Olina. You're away from the crowds, but still a relatively short drive (so long as you avoid commuter hours) from Honolulu and sightseeing spots. There are 4 man-made lagoons in Ko Olina. The Ko Olina Beach Villas are right at lagoon 2. Lagoon 1 has the Disney Aulani resort and I think the Four Seasons. Lagoon 3 has the Marriott and lagoon 4 is the public one, though all four lagoons are publicly accessible. We think lagoon 2 is the best, not just because it's the shortest walk from the condo (basically just down from the elevator and through the outdoor pool area), but also because it tends to be the least crowded. The lagoons are perfect for children - waters are pretty calm and don't get deep until you get pretty far out. We saw some people snorkeling, but it's not a real good spot for that. There are two towers in the Ko Olina Beach Villas. The condo is in the beach tower, which is the one closest to the beach. We've stayed at the other tower before, and while still nice, just isn't comparable to the beach tower. For the other tower, you're basically overlooking the interior of the resort and get barely, if any, a view of the ocean. The parking garage is also over the beach villa, meaning from Jackie's condo, we can take an elevator directly down to the garage (and one of the parking spots is pretty much right in front of the elevator), whereas in the other tower, you have to walk to the beach tower to take the elevator down to the parking garage. Jackie's condo also has one of the best views. It's on the penultimate floor on the side of the building where facing the empty lot where I think they will build the Atlantis resort, but you get a great view of the beach and ocean and of the sunset from the lanai. The condo has two rooms with two full bathrooms. The master is a nice size with an ensuite bathroom with a separate tub and shower. The other bedroom is smaller, especially suitable for kids. The second bathroom is just outside of the second bedroom. The condo is nicely furnished and not cluttered. Kitchen is modern. There is a smallish washer and dryer. I don't know whether the dryer was broken, but it wasn't giving out much heat. I'm sure we could have just called maintenance and they could have easily fixed, but we ended up just hang drying our clothes - they dried fast because of the weather and we helped conserve some electricity. There's plenty of towels and beach gear, including folding chairs, snorkeling gear, boogie boards and other flotation devices. There are a variety of restaurants..."},{"_id":"207251387","date":{"$date":"2017-10-28T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5288332","reviewer_id":"35902824","reviewer_name":"Eric","comments":"Beautiful place in a great location.

My first was in San Francisco the week before and unfortunately it was not great so I was a little disheartened and not sure what to expect. \r\nMy sister was joining me for my time in New York (she flew in from Australia) and we arrived at Luke's all full of chatter and excitement and the pictures of the apartment were spot on. It is a great apartment, industrial in look and Lukes artwork and style make it a wonderful and funky place to stay....just what an Aussie imagines a New York apartment to look like.\r\nMy sister and I were sharing the room and Luke gave us an option of putting a foldout bed (or cot as they call it in the US) in so we did not both have to share the queen size bed provided. We decided to go with this option on the second night and I ended up sleeping on the foldout for the whole trip as it was very comfortable.\r\nThe location of Luke's apartment is amazing. It is close to everything and we found getting around quick and easy. 'Stone Street' is just around the corner and not only did it  provide a huge range of eating options it also had a very cute look as the street is all cobblestones and in the right weather everyone eats outside. We even found ourselves an Aussie coffee shop in Broad Street which is just a 5 minute walk from the apartment and if you are an Aussie you will understand that this is a bonus as while New York is an awesome place the coffee is a little different to what we experience in Australia.\r\nAs a host Luke is wonderful even racing out to buy us a hairdryer when he realised the one in his bathroom was missing. The linen, pillows and towels were all clean and of good quality which was very noticeable to me after my stay in San Francisco.\r\nLuke as a person is sweet, interesting and very easy to share an apartment with (which is important when you are renting a room)\r\nMy sister and I were often very excited and very talkative and Luke took this all in his stride and we loved sharing our day with him in the evenings when we arrived home.\r\nLuke is intuitive and I think can judge just the amount of interaction his guests require. For my sister and I we felt comfortable with Luke pretty quickly and we now consider him a friend and he will always be an important part of a very special time for my sister and I. We had not seen each other for two years and this trip and the accommodation/location/host was a very big part of what made it so wonderful.

Can someone name me a better place to stay at in NYC??). Lucas is another one of New York’s gem - super friendly, super easy going and is just sooooo COOL. Stalk him on Instagram and (Hidden by Airbnb) if you don’t believe me!! And very down to Earth at the same time (despite all coolness and the amount of followers! Haha). Staying at Lucas’ place was literally the best Airbnb experience (and it definitely made our trip to New York!!) and I don’t think anyone will ever be able to match it.  \n\nHighly recommend this place if you are looking where to stay when visiting NYC!!

The apartment was exactly as pictured, with one exception: the view of the back of Gaudi's amazing Casa Batlló from all the windows was even BETTER than the pictures! We loved looking out onto this stunning building every day, and on several evenings, opened the windows wide to enjoy the concerts that were occasionally held on its roof. \r\n\r\nThe location was fantastic, right in the center of the Eixample, and within walking distance of a large majority of the major sights in the city. It was on one of the loveliest streets in the neighborhood, not too busy, not too noisy, but lively, and with everything a traveler could possibly want within one or two blocks: great restaurants, shops, a grocery store, metro stop, taxi stand, and a wonderful bakery/ice cream shop (very important!) literally next door. \r\n\r\nThe apartment itself was simple, clean, well-stocked; it had everything we needed, and everything worked. (We especially appreciated the great air conditioning, as Barcelona was having a heat wave when we were there.) \r\n\r\nWhile we didn't meet Enrique personally, he was incredibly responsive and easy to work with. In particular, we appreciated how he allowed us to check in quite early on the day we arrived. We had flown through the night from the U.S. and arrived bleary eyed in Barcelona on a Saturday morning. We were able to come straight from the airport, and were met at the apartment by Enrique's colleagues, who had a breakfast of croissants and juice waiting for us! This was so thoughtful, as we had barely eaten on the plane. \r\n\r\nIn short, this apartment was a perfect home base for us as we explored and got to know the wonderful city of Barcelona. We highly recommend it!

La casa non ha FINESTRE, ovvero aprendo la finestra, tutta piena di polvere e con una tenda che non viene lavata da anni, a 5 cm c’è’ il muro. Cio’ non ti permette di avere luce naturale durante la giornata; e’ una pessima sensazione!!!! Inoltre il wc, pur avendo fatto attenzione a non buttare carta, si è otturato ben 2 volte. Appena arrivata, avrei immediatamente cambiato appartamento, ma la mia ricerca era specifica in quella zona e purtroppo non ho trovato all’ultimo momento niente di disponibile.

The apartment was SO clean and it had everything we needed. The view was amazing as well, the windows were facing the view of Downtown Montreal and was even better when lit up at night. HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone!! Although, it is a shared kitchen, as it is a residence but that did not bother me at all. Oh, and, the king sized bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever been on.

Olivia and Bob met us and showed us around in a very friendly manner. Beforehand, Olivia even helpfully checked out the distance from the apartment to the relatives we were visiting. They thoughtfully ensured there were fragrance-free cleaning products appropriate for allergies and provided useful tourist information and guides. There is a well-stocked kitchen, sufficient linen and towels and good wifi reception. Olivia and Bob even left a bottle of wine to welcome us.  The location is excellent-  close to subway stations and in the centre of a lively, vibrant area filled with restaurants, shops yet it is quiet. Food shopping is easy as it is close to Wholefoods and Dean and Deluca. The only thing we would have preferred would have been a slightly larger bed .

We each took a bedroom; both complete with comfy bed and clean sheets. The recently renovated bathroom was beautifully done and had good water pressure, plenty of hot water, and fresh towels. Although we ate most of our meals out, we enjoyed using the well-appointed kitchen for snacks, breakfast and drinks. The rooftop terrace has fabulous views of the city, a perfect place for sipping morning coffee or evening cocktail. \r\nWe found the neighborhood charming with many restaurants, cafes, shops, and grocery stores within a few blocks radius. Yet, the apartment is conveniently located close to several subway and bus lines making it super easy to explore the rest of town. Little Italy; Chinatown; the Tenement Museum; and Dean and DeLuca are all within a few blocks of home base.  \r\nConsidering all of the activity in the surrounding neighborhood, the street and apartment were very quiet.\r\nWe unequivocally recommend this apartment and will wish to stay here on future visits to NYC!\r\n \r\n"},{"_id":"8867486","date":{"$date":"2013-11-23T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"533168","reviewer_id":"8062123","reviewer_name":"Joost","comments":"Very nice place to stay in NY.

Olivia is fantastic and we wished we could have spend more time with her. She is a very nice and interesting person. A filmmaker.

From the apartment itself which is spacious,  comfortable and has a rooftop with great views of the city to the location which in my opinion is unbeatable. If I was to move to NYC this is the neighbourhood I would be moving to with all the restaurants and shopping  available plus multiple subway lines enabling quick and easy transport around manhattan and beyond. We also found it helpful having Olivia and Bob a quick phone call or email away to answer any questions we had about anything,  they were very helpful. All in all a 5 star stay!

Olivia and Bob were very communicative prior to and during our trip and their welcome could not have been  better, particularly after a long day of travel.  The bottle of welcoming prosecco was a great touch of kindness.  Both Olivia and Bob explained many features of their lovely cosy home and the surrounding area.\r\nThe apartment is very roomy and cosy and we thought it looked much bigger \"in the flesh\" compared with the photographs.\r\nThe bedrooms are a perfect size, the bathroom modern and the kitchen is fully equipped.  We stayed for 10 days so some nights, when we just wanted to chill out, the kitchen facilities came in really handy and with a supermarket very close by we really did feel home from home.\r\nThe area where the apartment is is great. There are so many restaurants, shops, bars and is less high rise than most tourist parts of New York so it really feels village-like, adding to what was just a brilliant experience.\r\nOlivia and Bob are very knowledgeable about the area and their contact details were on hand 24/7 if we had any questions.  Luckily Ive been to New York a few times but there's always more you can learn and the welcome pack that Olivia/Bob provide is very useful for first timers and the more experienced NYC tourist.\r\n\r\nOverall an exceptionally magnificent and true NYC experience! Thank you Olivia and Bob."},{"_id":"37828063","date":{"$date":"2015-07-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"533168","reviewer_id":"55097","reviewer_name":"Karen","comments":"Olivia and Bob are warm, friendly and very helpful hosts.

Olivia and Bob provided great recommendations which we followed up on and were delighted with our experiences.\r\n\r\nLots of information was provided on arrival and we were encouraged to contact the hosts with any further questions. Its a big city with a lot to see so the maps, timetables and guide books provided saved us a lot of time.\r\n\r\nThe roof top garden is a big bonus - the views are breathtaking and it was a lovely place to sit in the evenings.\r\n\r\nTo conclude : If you are considering a homestay in Manhattan - look no further - you have just found the best.

Is already a great street that seems to be getting even better with still more shops and restaurants nearby that go late into the evening.\r\n\r\nApt spacious for NYC standards, quiet - as in no street noise – with washer/dryer in basement of elevator building. Has window AC units for warm summer days. Overall, nothing particularly fancy, but good. And was clean. Can also go up to roof for great view of city skyline or just to chill out. \r\n\r\nWas very busy during my time there, so made minimal use of kitchen, but it has gas range, fridge, dishwasher – everything needed to settle in or just prepare quick meals and snacks. Wireless Internet, too. Everything provided for bath and kitchen. Rented for about a month and apartment worked well. Understand they are changing some lighting, which will brighten up the living area. \r\n\r\nUnit definitely reflects its owners, right down to the multi-page apartment guide and its do's and don’ts. They are very invested in the unit and everything in it and how it will be used. My first time to use Airbnb, so having the owners that involved was a little unlike other experiences where have rented for weeks and months at a time elsewhere in the US and Europe. They, too, may still be getting used to the idea of renting out their apartment, and how to furnish it and let go to reduce their anxiety. \r\n\r\n"},{"_id":"87146285","date":{"$date":"2016-07-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"533168","reviewer_id":"26431219","reviewer_name":"Isleide","comments":"Olivia and Bob are the perfect hosts.

Olivia would often send me emails with information about nice events happening in Manhattan during our stay, including the unique \"Manhattanhenge\" solstice day - when the setting sun aligns perfectly with the grid.\r\nThe flat is beautiful.  I loved the warm colors and the great artwork with pieces collected from all over the world.  Bedrooms and beds are comfortable and all appliances in the flat are easy to use.  The location could not be better for us.  Lots of great restaurants, boutiques and interesting shops.

The living room is sizeable and comfortable and is a great place to wind down after a day. There was plenty of storage available in both bedrooms and the bathroom which really assists in settling in for your stay.  The lift access to the apartment was a godsend at the end of a day touring New York.  The view from the rooftop is amazing and the photos do not do this justice.\n\nThe location of this apartment is fantastic, close to multiple train lines in the heart of Nolita.  There are restaurants, bars, shops, coffee shops and Wholefoods just around the corner. A 20 minute walk to Union Square to the green market and 5 minutes from Broadway.  The location is perfect for those that want to experience New York out of mid town and feel more a part of day to day New York.\nBoth of us had been to New York a number of times before, so did not need much assistance from Olivia. Olivia checked in with us a number of times during our stay to ensure all was OK and there were no issues.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Olivia's and would recommend the apartment and location to anyone."}]}

Marketa met us as arranged and was generous with her time and gave us lots of  information about using the metro and local interests.

She arranged a taxi to the airport for our flight home when we checked in. She was very helpful with giving us tips about our visit. The apartment is in a great location, easy to get anywhere you want to go. It is also very spacious, spread out over 3 floors. FYI-the kitchen and laundry are on the top floor. Be prepared to do lots of stairs. The decor was very minimal and didn't feel very warm or inviting. The house is in mostly good repair. There is a washer, but no dryer. There are a couple of clothes drying racks provided. If you intend to do any cooking, the kitchen is not particularly chef friendly. It's tiny with essentials provided. There are no spices, etc. And no coffee pot. The mattress on the top floor is very hard. My husband loved it. I did not. I did not try the rest of them.

The apartment itself was brilliant, lovely and spacious, clean and fab central access to the city. We spent lots of time in Born which was no more than a 5 minute walk, but also had the chance to check out more of Barceloneta and the beach from this position which made for a really great trip. The neighbourhood itself, despite the occasional passing moped (standard!) was actually remarkably quiet considering the central location, and well lit. We also had luck on our side with 23C temperatures in the first week of Jan which made for a perfect visit!

There is no information or maps in the apartment but markets, restaurants, metro are all within walking distance once you get your bearings.\n\nAngeles's was not available to meet us upon arrival and our host kept 9 of us waiting for 20 minutes outside on the narrow sidewalk with our luggage in the heat; even though we called him an hour before when we arrived at the train station.  That was not a great introduction and we were nervous we were not in the correct location.  However, Angeles was great communicating before and during our stay.  \n\nThe kitchen does not have an oven but does have a two burner stove top and microwave.  We mainly ate pasta while there so it worked out fine.  The stairs do get a bit tiring but for the size of our group, the privacy it provided and the apartment location, it worked out fine.  One bath and hand towel is allotted per person for the length of stay so you need to buy/bring beach towels.  There is no dryer so you really need to plan when washing towels.  The washer takes about 2 hours for a cycle and drying time is a day on the drying rack.  \n\nOverall, a nice stay!"},{"_id":"175080653","date":{"$date":"2017-07-28T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5345273","reviewer_id":"111296357","reviewer_name":"Oscar","comments":"Good location and communication but there were some problems with the naighbours"},{"_id":"181584828","date":{"$date":"2017-08-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5345273","reviewer_id":"62604035","reviewer_name":"Bård","comments":"Great location close to Barceloneta beach.

It is less than 5 minutes walk from the marina and from the beach, both of which have great bars and restaurants. La Ramba is a half hour walk away, but a taxi costs just €7 and will have you there in five minutes. There are bars, restaurants and small supermarkets in the old town itself.\nThe house is made up of 3 separate units plus a large kitchen and bathroom on the ground floor. The first floor has a good sized double bedroom and ensuite bathroom. The second floor has the same layout as the first, but also has an additional door off the landing. This leads into a large living room with a bunk bed and balcony and a staircase to the third floor. The third floor has a large lounge with a single bed and balcony, plus doors leading to another double bedroom and a bathroom with a washing machine.\nThe house was spotlessly clean with plenty of towels and all the beds had new sheets and bedspreads. There were extra blankets should you need them, but we didn't. All areas have their own air conditioning and heating. The kitchen has all the crockery and utensils you could need, large fridge with freezer compartment, electric hob and oven and microwave.\n\nWhen we go back to Barcelona this will be the place we would want to stay again."},{"_id":"200433473","date":{"$date":"2017-10-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5345273","reviewer_id":"7903160","reviewer_name":"Matt","comments":"Angeles' location is conveniently located near shopping, groceries, and lots of restaurants in a vibrant part of town.

That was probably the best part of our stay in this flat. It does not meet the quality and standards that we have enjoyed from other flats on airbnb, whose customer service responded quickly and helped us relocate.\r\n\r\nThe photos of the flat are misleading: some furniture (like the two tables) has disappeared or been moved, some has been replaced, the two main blinds are broken, as is the shower-head holder - all in all resulting in a much less friendly and less practical feeling.\r\n \r\nBesides that, we found there to be a general feel of neglect: though the flat had been cleaned before we arrived, we had to bleach the bath tub twice and scrub it to make it look not disgustingly grimy. At least its cleaner now ... The shower curtain was mouldy, and there was an unpleasant smell from the kitchen cabinets.\r\n\r\nFinally, as the previous guest described in his comment - unfortunately posted after our booking - the neighbours are very very loud: they partied for three nights in a row until 4am, their front doors open to the corridor. We know Bondi Beach is a party place, but didn't expect it inside a residential building, and at this price for the flat.\r\n"},{"_id":"56880120","date":{"$date":"2015-12-19T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5347035","reviewer_id":"6797787","reviewer_name":"Claire","comments":"Javier's apartment was perfect.

We really enjoyed Sue's place! The view was incredible, the location was convenient, and the condo was well stocked. Every morning we were able to walk to a good local coffee shop. Also within easy walking distance was a convenience store with a decent amount of groceries and an inexpensive place to rent snorkel gear. The sunsets were beautiful and the facility was very quiet (which we liked). \r\n\r\nTwo minor things. One is that there wasn't a lot of information in the condo (ie checkout procedures, location of trash \u0026 recycling, etc.) Also, there were no beach towels, which wouldn't have been an issue at all if we had been able to get clean towels during our stay. But instead we were using our bath towels at the beach, and they get pretty sandy and dirty quickly that way. But really, this was a very minor issue. \r\n\r\nWe would definitely recommend this to others (probably parties of 2 but no more) and hope that one day we can come back! Sue gave us lots of great beach gear including chairs, coolers, ice packs, boogie boards and beach mats. All very much appreciated! \r\n\r\nthank you so much for making our Christmas stay such a delight!"},{"_id":"24826745","date":{"$date":"2015-01-03T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"535213","reviewer_id":"10875368","reviewer_name":"Christie","comments":"This was the best place we stayed our whole trip!

This place is right next to the ocean.  The grounds lead to a beach which had maybe two other couples on it when I went out to snorkel.  Very secluded.  Sea turtles were feeding and swimming around every day right by the stone wall that surrounded the grounds.  The view from the lanai (balcony) is breathtaking.  You see two of the other Hawaiian islands right there.  The place itself was very clean and has a full kitchen, so you can cook sometimes instead of eating out every day.  Sue was an amazing host.

We had a great time and would certainly stay here again.  The view is awesome, we saw rainbows every morning and turtles swimming by regularly.  There is no AC but even though it was July we did not miss it at all.  There is good cross-ventilation and a steady breeze, and ceiling fans in the living area and bedroom.  The complex is very friendly and we had several nice conversations with the residents.  We made good use of the Jenn-air grills, cooking up steaks and burgers from the Safeway down the road in Lahaina and watching the sunset over dinner.  The pool is on the small side but spotlessly clean and refreshing.  The groundskeepers do an excellent job maintaining the place.  Parking was easy and convenient.  There is a little swimming beach right next door.  There were a number of nice touches provided, including a couple of beach chairs and boogie boards.  The convertible sofa was comfortable for sleeping to the sound of the waves.  There is a TV and DVD player but no stereo to plug your music into.  While we were here we went to the Wednesday night Slack Key Guitar show at the Napili Kai just up the road and really enjoyed that.  Our only problem was a minor one, the wifi, which was extremely slow.  Like dial-up speed.  I ended up using data on my phone as that was much faster (fortunately there is good coverage from AT\u0026T).\r\n\r\nOverall this is an outstanding rental at a good price, the best place we have rented on Airbnb."},{"_id":"42870003","date":{"$date":"2015-08-16T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"535213","reviewer_id":"11406939","reviewer_name":"Steve","comments":"Sue's communication \u0026 instructions were great.

Best of all, you can't beat the patio where you can sit and have your coffee each morning, peacefully watching the waves roll in.\r\n\r\nThere was a small beach right next to the condo, but we did not spend much time there.  We had a rental car and traveled to other beaches.  Only 10 minutes from downtown Lahaina and we spent each night exploring the charming shops alongside the tourist traps.\r\n\r\nBring your own beach towels.  I forgot to bring them, but we bought a couple cheap at the local supermarket.\r\n\r\nChecking in and out was as easy as can be.

This 4th floor condo, with beach views to die for, was the perfect setting for our honeymoon. We had everything we needed for trips to the beach! Towels, chairs, noodles, boogie boards, coolers, wet suits and snorkel gear. But if your an avid snorkel, we recommend renting from boss frogs. Having no AC, was great, if you open the windows in the bedroom and the balcony door, it creates a great breeze. Location is fantastic! You can walk to any restaurant, from the condo. There's Miso Phat, China Boat, the pub, Maui Brewing Co. and a coffee shop. Anyone of the dozens of beaches is 15 min drive or less. Or you have access to a smaller beach next to the condo which is great if you like a quiet beach. If the weather isn't so great, there are plenty of books, board games, dominoes, etc. to keep you busy. The condo itself is very clean and well kept. We bought food to make breakfast for the week, and the kitchen has everything you need.

Of course, the number one reason to choose this place is the view. It is amazing! We used the lanai for breakfast, sunset viewing, and general lounging. The location is pretty good, halfway between Kapalua and Kaanapali but also a little tough because there isn't a beach to walk to (we knew this though). Really, our only hesitations were in the kitchen where we felt the stove top needed to be replaced (some of the burners don't work well). Plus we felt the kitchen could be better stocked with a tea kettle, for instance. The bed is comfortable but the sheets didn't fit well and kept coming off. The beach gear is great and useful but we had to rent snorkel gear because we didn't find the snorkel gear at the place very good. And also we couldn't find fins! One big thing to note: there are no beach towels. This is a huge bummer because you'll either have to spend about $17 for each or pack your own which is bulky and takes up space. \n\nOverall we liked this rental!

It's located in a lively and colorful and relatively poor popular neighborhood, in which it is one of the very few renovated buildings. This means that you get in touch with the life of real Istanbul people that you normally might not meet as a tourist in the regular tourist aereas. It is very near very well known and touristy aeras as Taksim Square, Istanbul's main shopping street Istakal Caddesi and the major aera with bars, cafés and clubs (all 5-10 mins walking). On Sundays there is a nice and busy market on the street. Lively means also quite noisy: bring your earplugs if you want to sleep early or sleep in the morning. \r\nThe apartment itself has been renovated in a simple and tasteful way: wooden floor, simple but adequate bathroom and kitchen \r\ntyhe only inconvenience I acn think of is that the bathroom floor isn't perfectly inclined to the shower drain, in a way that the bathroom floor remains partly wet.

Pinar and Firad were so nice and gave us extra mattresses that we put on the floor so that the four of us could stay in this apartment. \r\nIt was also great to have WLAN which worked pretty well.\r\n\r\nOpposite the apartment there is a small grocery store (and several more in the street) where we bought most of our food. Generally, the people were very friendly in the neighbourhood, a neighbourhood with \"normal\" people, not touristic at all. Which we liked a lot and was also one reason why we took this flat. Secondly, it was the location of it: maybe a 15min. walk to Beyoglu. \r\n\r\nIt was very easy to communicate with Pinar, she was very accommodating so that we would love to be her guests again.

She was home from Kenya during our visit, and even took us around the city and out to a Turkish dinner. Wonderful!\r\n\r\nThe apartment is as listed - it is lovely, clean, bright, and big. It's on a quiet street, very comfortable, and has all amenities you might need. There is a wonderful street market outside on Sundays. \r\n\r\nWifi is 3-8MBS, but that is common throughout Turkey. I would recommend getting a SIM card with 3G to tether if you need fast Internet. \r\n\r\nOne issue to know before you book: This apartment is solidly in the ghetto. It is very close (3 blocks) to the nice, touristy part of town. But make no mistake - this is the ghetto. Example: A homeless guy slept in our doorway for 3 nights (Pinar's friend quickly took care of this), and there was presumably human feces left by this homeless man outside our door for a few days.\r\n\r\nSo while this place was fine for us, just be aware of the location - I would not recommend this spot for families with small children, or anyone who feels uncomfortable around overt poverty. It is not dangerous, however. I never felt unsafe - the area is just unclean, and there are a lot of squatters. \r\n\r\nSo if you're ok with an area with \"character\" - this apartment will be perfect for you!

We found the apartment to be clean and bright and very much like the photos. Pinar was visiting from Kenya and we had the opportunity to meet her. She was very friendly and was quick to clear a couple of issues with the house when we moved in. The kitchen was adequate and we were able to prepare our meals in the house. There are stores nearby but selections are not great and visits to multiple stores might be necessary to find what you need. The washing machine on the lower level was a welcome addition. As others have done, I would have to mention that the neighborhood could be seen as rundown and difficult for some. The apartment is located a short distance from Istiklal Avenue, however the hill up to Istiklal is very steep and you have to walk in the busy road most of the way. It could be seen as dangerous to some. We also found public transportation difficult unless you first walk to either Taksim Square or Tunel Funicular which are both nearly 20 minutes away. There is a tram on Istiklal but it is not reliable. The neighborhood can be noisy, but we found it to be nice when we met people in shops in the neighborhood. The Sunday market outside the door would be a highlight for anyone visiting.

The apartment itself is excellent value -- spacious, cozy, \u0026 with everything you should need. I loved spending hours reading on the cushions in the bay windows overlooking the street. It's very well located less than a ten minute walk from Beyoglu and Taksim. The neighbourhood's somewhat rough character could be an issue for some people, but really, they shouldn't be put off -- everyone I came across was friendly and I never felt unsafe. Tarlabasi is a lively, fascinating area, with one of Istanbul's more interesting stories. One night I was invited to join in the dancing at a Kurdish wedding celebration just down the street. The shopkeeper with the food stall across the way was unfailingly helpful. And Sunday mornings are a nice surprise when the entire street is given over to a market, which is when I did most of my grocery shopping. (You step out the front door and there's a guy selling olives or cheese or spices for the day.) When I eventually return to Istanbul I would definitely consider staying here again.

The main difference from the photos is the bathroom - it's really old and needs remodeling badly. I even wore flip-flops in the shower. There is no shower curtain or separation of the shower area, so water gets all over the bathroom floor. Despite what the listing said, there was no shampoo or hair dryer. The neighborhood is also rough - really poor and not somewhere I would want to walk at night alone.\n\nWe booked Pinar's flat very last-minute after another host cancelled, which was very flexible of her, but 45 minutes after booking she informed me the flat was being painted and we had to stay in another room for the first night. The \"other room\" turned out to be a room in her nephew's downstairs flat. We had no idea we would be sharing a flat for the first night, and the flat we booked wasn't ready until 7 pm the next evening because they hadn't cleaned it. She didn't offer us a discount or anything for staying in a shared flat instead of the one we booked, or for the very late check-in.\n\nIn summary - this place might be fine as a long-term choice for students on a budget, but if you're in Istanbul for a few days and are looking for a nice place, stay somewhere else."},{"_id":"223296210","date":{"$date":"2018-01-01T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"536526","reviewer_id":"959892","reviewer_name":"Tatyana","comments":"Everything was ok but the appartament  is rather dark not like on the pictures , if you switch on the light it’s dim particularly in the evening , it was very cold to take a shower so we couldn’t because it was too cold !

The 1-bedroom apartment is spacious, clean and well maintained. The bed is firm, but comfortable and with radiators in every room it was sufficiently warm at night. (My stay was in the late fall, when the Istanbul weather is a little unpredictable.) The kitchen, though small, was perfect for cooking and Pinar provided nearly every kitchen item that one could need for meals small or large.\n\nContrary to what you might hear or read online, Tarlabasi is a safe and very interesting neighbourhood. It is very much a local area, where people live their lives, go to the local stores, drink tea for hours at the local shops, and go to the amazing and enormous Sunday market that is right on the same street as Pinar's building. It is very close to more touristy \u0026 fashionable areas (Istiklal Street, Galata, Taksim, Cihangir, Karakoy, etc.), but it is not a tourist area. So if you want a relatively quiet and relaxing place to stay, where you can see how \"normal\" people live in Istanbul, I'd highly recommend Pinar's apartment.\n\nPinar and Baran, her nephew who lives in the building, were extremely helpful and responsive to my queries. I would stay at Pinar's place again \u0026 recommend it for open-minded and thoughtful visitors to Istanbul.\n\nÇok teşekkürler Pinar!"},{"_id":"359512768","date":{"$date":"2018-12-17T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"536526","reviewer_id":"1829117","reviewer_name":"Aric","comments":"This apartment is one of the true treasures in Istanbul.

When I come to Istanbul, this is the only place I will stay at. It's perfect. \n\nPer the comments on the neighborhood, this is the real Istanbul! None of the touristy fake stuff you'll get up on Istiklal. Families live here, chat here, hang up their colorful laundry together, so you truly do get an actual feel of the city. \n\nBook this place immediately, and for longer than you think."},{"_id":"364700974","date":{"$date":"2018-12-31T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"536526","reviewer_id":"127793094","reviewer_name":"Graeme","comments":"We had a fantastic stay at Pinar's place.

This was our first airbnb experience and I was scared it might be awkward to stay with another family that I had never met, I was wrong. As soon as we walked in Maria made us feel at home.  She was warm and kind and gave us advice on where to go and how to get there. I also enjoyed being able to use my spanish with her. Her son, Juan, speaks english well and is very nice. Since he is 20, he was able to tell us about all the nightclubs and bars in the area. \r\nThe privacy was great. The room is at the end of the hall away from the living room and kitchen and has its own hallway and bathroom. Maria gave us a key for entry to the building, her apartment, and to lock our bedroom. We never locked our bedroom door when we left for the day. We knew we didn't need to. \r\nThe room has an armoire (closet) in there for you to put your things in. The bed was super comfy and the wifi worked great. My fiance and I were even able to relax one night and watch a netflix show. The room looks exactly like it is pictured. \r\nMaria and Juan never came into the room or bugged us. When we got back at night they just asked if we enjoyed our day and then offered us cold water for our room. \r\nThe shower and bathroom are small but still works great. My 6'4 fiance was still able to stand in it. Water also got and stayed nice and hot. Maria provided towels and shampoo. \r\nThe area is one of the best areas to stay at in Barcelona. The Lucia metro station, which will get you anywhere you need to go in Barcelona, is literally a 1 minute walk from her apartment. Maybe even 30 seconds. She is on a side street right off of Las Ramblas. Which was great because we were steps away from tons of bar and restaurants but not too close to all the noise. The room was pretty quiet. However, I still recommend taking air plugs if you are a light sleeper. \r\nMaria is also just a 5 minute walk to the Gothic quarters, which is an amazing area. My fiance and I were randomly walking around on our first night and stumbled into a food and wine festival going on in the Gothic Quarters, it was so much fun.\r\nStay with Maria and Juan! You won't regret it. \r\n"},{"_id":"52654808","date":{"$date":"2015-10-31T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5404095","reviewer_id":"8011931","reviewer_name":"Colleen","comments":"We had a wonderful time in Barcelona, it's one of our favorite cities.

Nice neighborhood but the host has no map or list of supermarkets, etc for guest use. Juan is quick to answer emails on behalf of Maria (who speaks no English) but he was very rarely home in person during our four days. Maria never suggested we call Juan for answers, so i presume the phone number provided during reservation is Maria's own number. The bedroom is smaller than pictured, so the bed crowds a space cut up by two hallway doors in opposite corners and an armoire in a third corner. The bathroom and the kitchen are located on opposite sides outside the bedroom. So if one guest is moving things in or out of the armoire, the other guest can access either the bathroom or the kitchen but not both except by climbing on the bed. The guest bedroom door is at the end of a long (and nice) hallway that connects the kitchen, the living room and all other rooms. So the bedroom door has to stay closed if guests want privacy, otherwise the interior is visible from everywhere in the hallway. Keeping it closed can slow air circulation on a hot summer day, but for me the bigger concern would be the absence of a normal and fixed heat source in the bedroom for winter because in the US a portable heater is considered a potential fire hazard (except for temporary purposes) and therefore illegal in a rented bedroom. Fortunately there is a fixed electric heater in the bathroom 22 feet from the guest bed. I recommend this rental for its cleanliness and great location for sightseeing and the airport bus.

Plenty of nice bars around, and the port is easily in walking distance.\n\nOverall I would definitely recommend this place. Good value, with a pleasent apartment and a lovely host.

The location was absolutely the best possible location in Barcelona. It is truly just steps away from Las Ramblas and the Liceu metro stop was at the corner. \nMaria's home was quite lovely and very comfortable, while Maria herself was very gracious and hospitable. She even had coffee and muffins for us, which was unexpected but greatly appreciated. There was an array of business cards and helpful information in her very welcoming entrance foyer, and she answered any question we asked.\nThe rooms for us were much more like a private suite than simply a room. First there was a locking door to separate you from the other areas of the flat, then the largest bedroom, a hallway with a comfortable and clean bathroom, then a second bedroom with a smaller (twin size) bed. All perfect for us. The hall and both bedrooms have very tall windows. The elevator to the flat was also very appreciated after we spent our days walking all over town.\nThe street seemed quite lively, even into the night on the weekend, but I always felt very safe and no noise whatsoever traveled to our bedrooms.\nMaria was always friendly and pleasant when we saw her, but also gave us plenty of space. \nStaying at Maria's house added nothing but lovely memories to our great time in Barcelona. I wouldn't hesitate for a minute to stay at this great place on any future trip to this wonderful city."},{"_id":"156371936","date":{"$date":"2017-05-30T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5404095","reviewer_id":"71632653","reviewer_name":"Edwin","comments":"Maria practices excellent communication, and will above and beyond in exceeding expectations.

And for the apartment, it's really a nice and quite place to spend the night. The only downside I can think of is the apartment's WiFi which regularly got disrupted and we had no internet for a while. Also, since we visited Barcelona in March, it was quite cold and we were really surprised with the inconsistency of hot water for bathing.

Very clean, nicely decorated and the perfect place to recharge from the fun of Barcelona.\n\nWe did a few loads of washing while at Maria’s and this was never a problem, she was always helpful and we found her an absolute delight to chat to despite the language barrier - which sometimes made it even more fun!\n\nGreat location, everything was either in easy walking distance or accessible by the metro.

Her kitchen is complete and we have access to her kitchen and washing machine which is very important to long travelers like  us who needs to cook meals and wash our clothes. She wasn’t around when we stayed but she was very accommodating in answering all our queries and needs. She let us leave our luggages while we went around the area. Her place is a few steps away from the famous Boqueria and the Maremagnum mall. I highly recommend her place to anyone visiting Barcelona.

At Maria's apartment, my friend and I each had our own bed and bedroom, a private bathroom, and a lot of room to unpack all of our belongings. In addition, there is a shared kitchen, and Maria gives you full access to that space; for us, this meant making many delicious espressos. The location of the apartment is also spectacular. It is immediately off of La Rambla, which is very touristy, but still in close proximity to some terrific areas, namely the Gothic Qrt, Raval, and the beaches.

We flew into Barcelona, and it was easy to get to Klaus and Omar's place by metro, as it's across the street from the metro station. They were super nice and friendly, even when our flight was delayed and we arrived later than we expected. We left by train, and the train station barcelona-sants is like a block away and easily walkable. We walked over to FC Barcelona one morning and MNAC at night to see the magic fountains! We also happened to be in town when there was a street festival going on, so the street was closed off and there was live music right outside our balcony! Because the area is busy, it does get loud. However, the hosts installed foam sound barriers on the balcony doors to help insulate most but not all of the sound. We still slept great though, and would recommend staying here to others!

The location of the apartment was great as it was very close to the metro station (2-3 min walk) and buses run literally right outside of the building door. To add to this, there are many cafes and places to eat nearby/ walking distance from the apartment. \n\nOur only issue during our stay was the bed was a bit small for two people to share and the pillows were not very comfortable. It was manageable though, but that could be one thing to improve the experience/stay. This spot offers tremendous value for the price/location of the apartment.

Our home is at the foot of the \"slope,\" where homes were built for the working classes of the late 1800s, so the homes are less Victoriana and more utilitarian. Today, there are numerous bars, fabulous restaurants of every price range, and Prospect Park is a leisurely 15 minute walk away. In the park there are hiking and running trails, skating (ice and roller), boating, fishing and a weekly green market. Barclay's Center is a 20-30 minute walk away.","notes":"We have a flat-screen TV with cable, HBO, NetFlix and Pandora.

The place was super clean(as I guess it should be for the $75 cleaning fee-worth it when amortized over 4 days), spacious at 700 sq.ft., well-stocked, \u0026 located on the ground floor( a plus for us older people). Michael was very pleasant \u0026 helpful on the one occasion that we needed help, \u0026 very available, an obvious advantage of having the host living in the same building. When he came down to help us with a TV technology problem(shocker-an older couple having trouble with how to work the remotes), he seemed genuinely glad to help us, rather than it being an annoyance to him. Communication was very speedy \u0026 helpful. Checking-in and out was easy \u0026 went smoothly; we even quickly found a parking space on the next block \u0026 didn't have to move it until the weekly street sweeper came in 4 days). The neighborhood info booklet, put together with effort by Michael \u0026 Orlando, was useful, as were the travel books. We would add a semi-close coffee/pastry store, Martin's Café, apparently popular with the locals, on 5th Ave., opposite the Middle School, near 5th St., as I recall.\r\n5th Ave., in general, had many stores, with a number of eateries, including fast food places and non-fancy, affordable sit-down restaurants. Prospect Park was a 15 minute walk away, but you're walking through blocks of lovely brownstones, etc. with very nice autumnal flowers \u0026 other decorations. And another 15 min. walk through Prospect Park (not Central Park, but still very nice) has you at the Botanical Gardens \u0026 Brooklyn Art Museum. \r\nTraffic noise was hardly noticeable and not a problem. The neighbor's construction must have finished, or if not finished, it didn't produce any morning noise. The only noticeable, but bearable morning noise was the low-grade rumble of the very near-by subway, an acceptable trade-off for the convenience of having 3 different subway lines steps away from your front door.\r\nI would definitely recommend this lovely apartment with its great location and its Super Host."},{"_id":"51610802","date":{"$date":"2015-10-22T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5410897","reviewer_id":"39330726","reviewer_name":"Debora","comments":"Siamo stati una settimana in questo bellissimo appartamento..

The apartment was as described in the listing, was spotlessly clean \u0026 well appointed with a very comfortable bed. The bathroom was a good size and had a very good shower.\r\nMichael had made up a local guide listing local amenities \u0026 restaurants, he had also left some complimentary drinks in the fridge on our arrival. We made good use of his restaurant recommendations. The subway station was at the bottom of the street and made access into Manhattan very easy. \r\nWe were also impressed with the Park Slope neighbourhood and Brooklyn generally and would recommend visitors spend some time exploring locally. \r\nHe also let us have a late check out on our departure.

There is a subway that will get you to Manhattan in about 20 min that is literally a half block away.

The apartment is light filled and spacious, plenty of room for everyone to spread out, it is equiped with everything you might need for a multi-night stay. Robert was immediately available to answer any questions though, I didn't have many as everything was well explained before my arrival and further explained in the handy notebook full of information about the apartment and the neighborhood. The convenience to the subway stop can't be over stated, half a block! We had an easy drive to Park Slope from D.C., and just as Robert suggested we would on a Friday night, found a parking space right on the block. Some of our favorite Brooklyn restaurants are within a few minutes walk, Al Di La (Italian), Culture (the best frozen yogurt), Martin (coffee), Locanda Mariella (Italian wine bar), Olivier (a sweet little French bistro) and on 5th Ave are a great Thai and Mexican restaurant whose names I don't remember at the moment.

It couldn't have been more perfect!  Tim met us upon arrival and showed us the property.  There was wine waiting for us in the fridge, which was lovely.  The house is beautifully furnished and appointed in an exotic style with a beautiful Buddhist altar being the perfect heart of the house.  There is a full kitchen, a hot tub and two separate sleeping areas.  The hot tub was lovely for a soak after a day of exploring Volcanoes National Park.  There is a washer/dryer which made it nice to be able to pack clean clothes before we headed to our next stop.\r\n\r\nThere is a beautiful black sand beach across the street, but unfortunately we didn't get to spend time there - we will have to visit again!   It's about 30 minutes to the nearest town, so if you are in search of a nightlife and party spot, this isn't the place for you.  However, if you want to feel like you are literally in the middle of the rainforest you will love Bali House!  We fell asleep listening to the surf and the frogs, and woke to the sound of rain on the roof.    Everywhere we looked there was something new to see - baby pineapples in the garden, a friendly gecko in the bathroom (we called him/her Java!) and beautiful views from the lanai!\r\n\r\nIliani was very helpful from the moment we first sent an inquiry about the house.  She answered every question quickly and graciously.   She and Tim are wonderful hosts and provided a wonderful retreat!  I would highly recommend Bali House to anyone who would like to experience the Big Island up close and personal.

The road runs along the ocean and is a beautiful walk or drive. The house is very well furnished and set back from the road enough that you don't hear road noise in the house. Two bedrooms provide ample space for two couples. Great option for visiting the coast near Pahoa. \r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: Keep in mind that this area is very close to the lava activity just uphill of the town of Pahoa, and while we didn't have any problems that could change any time. There are no stores open in Pahoa, so you have to do your shopping in Hilo. \r\n\r\nAlso there is no cellular service at the house (there is wifi and a landline phone), and (Hidden by Airbnb) Maps / Apple Maps gives incorrect directions to the address. You need to go to the south end of Hwy 130 and then double back on 137 about 3.5 miles to find the house.

The house and location are just as in the pictures. The house is peaceful, with beautiful ocean views and the decor in the house is amazing. Best airbnb rental we ever stayed at!! The house had everything we needed, from a well equipped kitchen, extra snorkeling gear, to a much loved hot tub (kids fave), a BBQ patch and washer and dryer. The black sand beach on walking distance from the house was beautiful and we could watch the dolphins play, but the surf and undercurrent were too strong for our 6 and 9 year olds. Instead we spend a lot of time snorkeling at the tidal pools at Kapoho Beach and swimming and snorkeling in the spring fed Ahalanui Beach Park, both reachable by car. As the location of Bali house is secluded, you need to drive to Pahoa for groceries (30 min drive), but for that you get a quiet neighborhood without being run over by tourists. On the same plot as the Bali house is also a small cottage. During our stay there was a couple staying there, but there is enough privacy. If you're with a larger party, renting the Bali house and cottage would be a perfect solution. Although many people made comments about the frogs, we kinda loved the background noise when falling to sleep (and they are not your usual frogs ... More like birds)"},{"_id":"29095646","date":{"$date":"2015-04-04T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"543962","reviewer_id":"15025599","reviewer_name":"Kim","comments":"Tim was waiting for us at the gate to the lovely \u0026 peaceful Bali house.

My wife and I spent 4 nights there as part of our 10 year anniversary trip to several Hawaiian Islands. We loved the style and cultural feel of the place! Very calming and relaxing. The roaming geckos were cool and the sounds of the coqui frogs at night and the very light but short rain spurts let you know you were in a tropical rainforest environment. The architecture and decorations are very unique and fun to explore and admire. We got there at night and had trouble figuring out the gate but we contacted the hosts and they got us in within a few minutes and gave us a guided tour  They were always available and helpful! The Kehena beach across the street was beautiful. Great privacy to watch the amazing sunrise before 7am.  Not a place to swim if you are not s strong swimmer because of rough surf and strong undertow but breathtaking place to hang, get a tan, and a quick dip. We frequented Uncle Roberts Awa Bar 3 miles down the road to eat daily and had a blast there during the Wednesday evening market where hundreds of people from over the island come to eat, sell goods, listen to music, drink, and dance. The active lava flow is only 4.25 miles from Uncle Roberts, but you have to walk there on a stone trail or rent mounting bikes. Rent the bikes! The trip is totally worth it and no need to pay for a tour when you stay at the Bali house because it is so close! We also ziplined the Akaka Falls just north of Hilo with a zipndip tour. Totally worth it! We also toured Volcano NP which were both only an hour away. If you want to have adventures yet stay in a private and romantic place away from crowded tourists then choose the Bali House!"},{"_id":"92379129","date":{"$date":"2016-08-08T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"543962","reviewer_id":"8039517","reviewer_name":"JC (And Kain)","comments":"The Bali House is like a fantasy from a dream. If ever you have read stories of the Pacific or seen movies, you will feel especially transported. We didn't get to meet Iliahi, but she was lovely on the phone. We did meet her husband, Tim, who greeted us and took us on a tour of the house and property. He was truly genuine in making himself available if we needed anything during our stay and offering for us to eat any fruit we found on the property. And Iliahi and Tim kindly swapped out the greeting bottle of wine with papaya and pineapple from the grounds since we don't drink. They were incredibly fresh and sweet! So if fruit is in season during your visit, trying them is highly recommended. The house is pretty indescribable; the photos do it the justice words can't. It is a magical construction, with everything needed for a memorable stay. We were able to prepare meals in the well-appointed gourmet kitchen, and we slept great. The location is excellent for enjoying and exploring the whole Puna region, and really the rest of the island, for that matter. The part of the property and stay that we enjoyed and appreciated most was the incredible night-time stargazing and the most densely-visible Milky Way we've seen anywhere (and we've had excellent viewings in Australia, Colorado and the Adirondacks). You can actually see the full arch of the Milky Way from this location, which we had never encountered before, so we appreciate Iliahi and Tim sharing their home."},{"_id":"95436816","date":{"$date":"2016-08-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"543962","reviewer_id":"61711713","reviewer_name":"Christy","comments":"We stayed at three different locations on our trip and this was hands down my favorite.  I have already told my boyfriend this is EXACTLY where I want to stay when we come back.  The cottage is exquisite and many extras were already provided.  Our host provided a very informative manual about the area, and gave us a tour and told us about the things travelers actually want to know.  Where the cool party is, where the secret beach is, etc.  But the location is what I was most grateful for.  You are literally right across the street from the path to a beautiful beach, about 30 minutes from the mesmerizing volcano park, and while we didn't get to explore it, downtown Pahoa seemed like a good spot for a chill night out.  The beach is accessible by a rocky path, so I don't recommend for anyone who has unsteady footing.  Also, the cottage has many gold dust day geckos, which some people may not like, but I adored.  They are beautiful and our host mentioned how to win their favor so I had fun interacting with them.  Ocean sound and coqui frogs at night, ocean view from bedroom.

We loved it here in every way; so much so, we found a way to change our plans midstream and stay another night!\n\nIliani and Tim were outstanding hosts. Tim met us and gave us a tour of this truly unique place. It is a beautiful and unique house with just about every amenity you could want, stationed just across the street from the ocean and a secluded black sand beach.\n\nThe house was well-appointed and functional but also truly unique with its layout and decor. It's shaped like a boat with the kitchen and dining area on one end, a sunken living room and a loft bedroom on the other end. Walking through to the back reveals a great open stone shower, private bath and a full second private bedroom that makes you feel immersed in the jungle.\n\nOut front there is a hammock which we enjoyed for hours, as well as a jacuzzi that was perfect at the end of each day. There was also a small patio out back and washer/dryer for handy laundry. \n\nThis location is off the beaten path for sure; but we loved going into Pahoa which is only about a 15-minute drive. Great local eats and coffee there. \n\nFrom this location we did day trips to the Kapoho tide pools, to Hilo and to the Volcanoes national park. Our location added a bit of distance but it was trivial and the reward was to post up at this truly special location each night. \n\nMaking fresh coffee in the morning and seeing the sunrise with the occasional rain shower only added to our fond memories here. \n\nTip: be prepared that Coqui frogs are pretty loud at night! They add to the rainforest ambiance but they also don't let up until dawn. You get used to it, but definitely advise earplugs. And do yourself a favor and be sure to get up for sunrise a few times. Worth it 100%.\n\nWe will be back! (there is a second guest cottage on property - very private - and we hope to bring friends and rent that out too). \n\nBest possible review here. Highly recommend - thanks Tim \u0026 Iliani!

It's just as the pictures show. Quite a relaxing place and a very well done house - comfortable, well laid out \u0026 exquisitely decorated! The master bedroom faces the ocean and it's just lovely waking up to the ocean sounds. The frog sounds are pretty loud at night but a wonderful way to fall asleep. There are a lot of geckos crawling around everywhere - they're harmless but if you're bothered by any of that just keep in mind they're everywhere on the walls in the house. The location was perfect for us - we didn't realize until we got there that the lava flows from Kilauea are just a few miles down the street. It was an easy drive and we had a great time biking and seeing the lava flows up close and personal on our very first night in. There are also tide pools 10miles from the location that are just perfect for snorkeling - absolutely beautiful! We also enjoyed walking to the beach across the street. The location is secluded but close enough to a number of excursions. The town of Pahoa is only 15 mins away and a great place to grab food - we loved having breakfast at Pele. We also drove to Hilo a few times, went to the Volcanoes national park \u0026 Mauna Kea from here and the drives were not bad at all.

Calling it a house does not do it justice; rather, it is a vessel designed for self exploration and rekindling of our universal connection with nature. Virtually every nook and cranny of this property is worth photographing. My wife and I were lucky enough to book this stay while it was available, and it ultimately created an experience we will likely never forget. Tucked away on the southeastern side of the Big Island, this gorgeous estate offers an off the beaten path opportunity to embrace the true concept of Hawaii while soaking in the splendor of feeling alive. From fresh pineapples, limes, coconuts, papaya, etc. (depending on the season), to a well rewarded hike down to Kehena Black Sand Beach, as well as out of this world views of the nocturnal red glow of the magma that the Goddess, Pele, has extracted from deep within Earth to grow her lush paradise, the Bali House will certainly not disappoint. Tim and Illiah are exceptional hosts. They truly have dedicated their lives to create an experience that everyone should share. Additionally, if you're lucky enough to run into the keeper of the grounds, absolutely take time to chat and pick his brain. He was a delight to converse with, and his botanical tour was definitely a highlight of our stay. We will likely book here again in the near future.

She explained everything about her apartment and was always just a text away. \n\nThe only downside to her apartment was that it's on the 4th floor of a walk-up.

I want to let you know about myself, my job and my home studio. Firstly,  I was born in Bursa, Turkey in 1979. I have been living in Istanbul for 15 years. I have got my Bachelor Degree in Istanbul, Bilgi University, department of  Photography and Video (P.O.V.). As you see I am really interested in art and I love creating. I do my job freelance, because I belive that I need to feel free to create more and express better. I have had my own studio before I have decided to have my own home-studio. Now, I do not only love working and living here becouse of the location, but also because of the atmosphere of my place. I mean there are beautiful old houses , buildings, cafes, museums, galleries, historical places, all kinds of restaurants and all kinds of transportations options. Further more, it really helps me to  let go of anxiety, stress and feel more confortable, that is peacefull and relaxing. For instance I am able to listen loudly music whenever I would like, or I do not hear any other’s in here.  Lastly, at these days, I am planning to be a part of one art collective or collaborate with some young artists . If you like, you  can bring you ideas, creativity and art into my collaboration. \r\n","host_response_time":"within an hour","host_thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/28218204/profile_pic/1424703673/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","host_picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/28218204/profile_pic/1424703673/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","host_neighbourhood":"","host_response_rate":100,"host_is_superhost":false,"host_has_profile_pic":true,"host_identity_verified":false,"host_listings_count":1,"host_total_listings_count":1,"host_verifications":["email","phone","reviews"]},"address":{"street":"İstanbul, İstanbul, Turkey","suburb":"Beyoglu","government_area":"Beyoglu","market":"Istanbul","country":"Turkey","country_code":"TR","location":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[28.97704,41.02656],"is_location_exact":false}},"availability":{"availability_30":30,"availability_60":60,"availability_90":90,"availability_365":365},"review_scores":{"review_scores_accuracy":10,"review_scores_cleanliness":7,"review_scores_checkin":9,"review_scores_communication":8,"review_scores_location":10,"review_scores_value":9,"review_scores_rating":83},"reviews":[{"_id":"33844359","date":{"$date":"2015-06-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5451782","reviewer_id":"2396558","reviewer_name":"Jason","comments":"Ersan's apartment was wonderful and he was a great host.

It was quiet, clean, and well maintained.  We never once had to contact Jun or Evan for further instructions or questions.  The air conditioners kept the rooms cool and humidity free, much appreciated during our stay as the trade winds were absent and the island was very muggy.  The full size kitchen appliances were nice for storing left-overs and cooking meals when we were in the mood.  The penthouse deck had awesome views and the pool was nice for a dip away from the crowds.  The parking space was ample and stored our Dodge Charger with ease.  There was a lot of construction on Kuhio as they build a Saks 5th Avenue so getting to Nahua was slow.  But once they finish, access and shopping will be a breeze!

He was able to accommodate an early check-in and we were extremely grateful.  The apartment has plenty of natural light, a great sized living area and located just a few blocks from the heart of Waikiki … only around 5 to 8 minute walk to the main shopping areas and a few more minutes from the shopping areas to the beach.  It was neat, tidy and renovated well.  The description and photos on the website is exactly what you get.  The air conditioning worked great and the floor layout worked well as the living, kitchen, sleeping and bathroom are all separate areas. The kitchen is well stocked with all the utensils for cooking a proper meal and the oven worked perfectly.  All cleaning equipment namely washing detergent, paper towels, portable vacuum, swivel sweeper to keep the floors clean together with the disposable cloths for the sweeper and trash bags were all provided which made living just like at home. The bonus is having a washer and dryer in the apartment.  We did encounter intermittent WiFi dropping out and there was a little noise from the construction site on Kuhio Street as they are building Saks 5th Avenue at the old Market Place site. The building is also very secure and we did feel safe staying here. Check-in instructions were exactly as described without any problems whatsoever.

However, the listing for a \"Waikiki 1bd\" led us to believe that we would have a 1 bedroom apartment, not a studio. This is a STUDIO apt. We were traveling with our 6-months-old baby and had expected to have an enclosed bedroom for her to sleep in while we could continue to use the apartment. This was a disappointment. Now that I look back at the listing photos, I could have surmised this, but nowhere is it stated. The absence of a lanai/veranda (not advertised, but still missed) made this worse. \r\nAccessing the building using the lockbox wasn't difficult. It was great to have a parking space and a washer/dryer. The full wall of windows were nice, and you have nice views of the Honolulu hills, especially at night. The description \"super clean\" in the listing isn't wrong, but the apartment is a bit more cluttered feeling than the photos show. Also, the description that says \"There is a full kitchen with brand new appliances and all the cookwares you may need to prepare your favorite meal\" is true, but the cookwares are a bit worse for wear. Most items are from Ikea, and you can imagine what would become of them after high turnover use. Knives are dull or bent, strainer is torn, etc. It is functional, and we did enjoy cooking. Having dish towels would have been nice, as it felt weird using white hand towels from the bathroom. Fresh sponges, too. It is also strange in a place that advertises cooking options that there was literally nothing for food prep. I love having an empty fridge, but no salt, pepper, sugar, coffee filters, or oil was inconvenient. Having Food Pantry a block away was nice, but kitchen basics (which even resort condos provide) would have been helpful. \r\n\r\nWe enjoyed our stay, but I don't think we'd return to this unit again. The parking space is on the 5th level, so you have to loop around quite a lot to find it, but having parking was great. There are a bunch of weird storage areas in the garage: it looks like owners use their parking spaces to store old furniture and building supplies."},{"_id":"78101864","date":{"$date":"2016-06-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5464028","reviewer_id":"22547009","reviewer_name":"Alecia","comments":"Thanks, Jun!

A few previous reviewers said the bed was \"soft,\" but this bed isn't soft, it's worn out. With two people in the bed, you roll right into the middle and into each other all night long. We had a terrible nights sleep. Plus the \"bed\" is merely a mattress on the floor making it difficult to get in and out of.  After a long day of sightseeing, you want to be able to rest at night.

My boyfriend and I stayed here and it was comfortable. ABC store, grocery store, car rental, International Marketplace and plenty of restaurants are all within a 3-minute walk, and it's just a short 10-minute walk to the beach.  Free parking was nice.  We were close to everything, so we only used our rental car when we drove to the North Shore, Koko Head trail and restaurants/stores that were further away.  In-unit washer and dryer were a big plus--we were able to wash our beach towels and swimsuits so they wouldn't stink up our suitcases.  Jun's place had a bodyboard (as well as beach mat and a few beach toys for kids) that we used at the beach, and we also bought cheap inflatable innertubes and an air pump at the ABC store.  I do wish beach towels were available in the unit, though, since they take up so much space in our suitcase.  We did not cook at the condo.  If you plan to, you'll need to buy essentials like cooking oil, spices, etc. -- the kitchen doesn't have any.  The freezer had ice packs--good for packing a picnic at the beach.  There are two remote-controlled window AC's--they worked great and the noise didn't bother us.  Bed was comfy.  Bathroom had shampoo and body wash, and has two doors -- great for ventilation so it never got steamy.  There's a pool and  small gym on the top floor, but we didn't use it.  Balcony railing repairs were going on during our stay (mid-November), so we did see construction workers once or twice outside our window during normal business hours (they didn't see us since we kept the shades drawn) and the drilling was quite noisy once in a while.  However, this wasn't much of a problem since we were barely at the condo during the day.  Nights were quiet, although we could hear outside traffic just a tiny bit since there was airflow above the window AC in the living room.  Jun and his co-host were very responsive when I had questions.  Our flight out wasn't until midnight, so I asked Jun if we could check out late.  We paid an additional fee of half the daily rate, so we could check out anytime since no one was scheduled to have the condo right after us--so glad we had this option.  We would definitely stay here again!  Great value for location and amenities.  Thanks for a great vacation in Waikiki!"},{"_id":"217330759","date":{"$date":"2017-12-08T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5464028","reviewer_id":"92212774","reviewer_name":"Dylan","comments":"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at 444 Nahua.

The condo was well stocked, all basics in the kitchen, nice to have the washer/dryer to wash the towels halfway through the week. However there was construction on the outside of the building. It was quite noisy and we had workers outside our window some days. The biggest complaint in the condo is the roller blinds. They are very difficult to open and close we had to fix them every time, the chains would come apart. They also do not offer much for darkness in the morning the apartment gets very light starting at 6:30 am making it difficult to sleep.

The place was very very clean and homely and the owner made a lot of effort to ensure we were comfortable and had all the relevant info needed.  Only negative I would say was that it was more of a studio than a 1 bed so felt quite small with 2 of us. It would also have benefited from a plug in heater of some sort as it was very cold at night.   Other than that we very much enjoyed our stay."},{"_id":"114347705","date":{"$date":"2016-11-17T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"5469086","reviewer_id":"1356779","reviewer_name":"Luis","comments":"Great position, close to the beach.
