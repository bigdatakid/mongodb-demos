It’s in the most amazing neighborhood, close to other interesting parts of the city and in walking distance to some of Istanbul’s best cafes, breakfast places and restaurants. We were truly happy and grateful to be in Dilara’s apartment because the location made our stay so much nicer. The beds were very comfortable after our long days spent walking around. Bedsheets and towels were clean which made it easy to feel at home. Lots of storage space in case you stay longer. Very good and reliable high speed internet, equipped kitchen for your basic needs, cozy living room! Everything was amazing. Dilara gave us amazing recommendations whenever we needed help or had questions about things in the area. She was always in reach and responded quickly every time we needed to ask a question. Truly one of the best hosts out there! Thank you Dilara :)\n\nMy only criticism is that in the bathroom, either the sink or the shower drain was giving off an odor that made it a bit smelly. I’m sure it can be easily fixed though."}]}

Eva and her boufriend have been absolutely welcoming since our first email contact: they provided us lot of informations about the apartment and the sorroundings, and we immediately felt comfortable about our booking. We had the chance to meet them a our arrival, and we exchanged some more details about the apartment and the sorroundings, key return, minor duties for apartment care (such as watering plants) and neighborhood attractions. They kindly wrote us down a list of attractions, restaurants and things to do in Williamsburg and in the sorrounding area. The apartment is located 50 meters away from Bedford Ave, a very busy street fullfilled with bars, restaurants, 24/7 shops: not very much car traffic, but a lot of people going round which made us feel completely comfortable and safe even when coming back late at night. Wiliamsburg is a good place where to stay in general, a residential area with many restaurants, live music bars, busy but not chaotic The subway station is about 7-8 minutes walk from the apartment, and it is 3 stops away from the Greenwich Village in Manhattan, an area we enjoyed during our stay. The apartment itself was comfortable for us, big enough for two persons (kitchen, living room, bedroom, studio), especially for us which spent a lot of time touring the city and didn't really need that much living space. The fast internet connection allowed us to call home through (Hidden by Airbnb) , and the AC helped us survive the NYC summer heat! Neighbors were quite silent, and the experience was very positive. We surely recommend Eva and Kent."},{"_id":"3185580","date":{"$date":"2012-12-30T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"277133","reviewer_id":"1171116","reviewer_name":"Julien","comments":"Very cute apartment in a great neighborhood!

It’s close to everything I need plus, so many good restaurants and pubs  which I don’t really need during weekdays, but if you are a foodie, then......The house itself is clean, tidy and comfortable to stay at.

Her place was very accessible. Turn left towards Wanchai MTR station, and turn left to lots of eating places at Causeway Bay. Her place is very near the infamous Kam’s Roast Goose – Hong Kong’s Michelin Starred Roast Meat Restaurant, at Hennesy Road (just a street behind). But we had kids with us and they were too tired to queue for 45mins for any kind of food, haha! \n\nWe usually went out about 10am in the morning and came back at night. Loads of dining choices for us, including little cha chaan teng (literally: 'tea restaurant') , dim sum, Japanese, Malaysian, Seafood, and Italian cuisines. There were convenience stores like 7-Elevens, OK and Circle Ks every 100+metres....even a 24-hr McDonalds!\n\nHer apartment is spacious by Hong Kong standards. We enjoyed the Queen-sized beds in one bedroom and the living room (most apartments offer double beds, which is super single by Malaysian standards). Her place was hygienic and there were clean towels and linens. Just note that you would need to switch on the heater for hot water and wait approximately 15 minutes for the water to heat up. Although there were shops on the ground floor, there weren't any noise at all, not even in the day time. Most of them were hardware shops and tiles shops and they were closed by the time we came back from dinner. So we all had restful sleeps.\n\nHer place is very accessible with MTR stations, trams and buses. Tram rides were fun and they run daily from early morning until midnight. No matter how far you travel, each tram ride costs the same flat fare and exact change is required if you are paying by cash. All trams accept Octopus cards. You need to get on the tram at the back and then pay the exact fare at the front when you're getting off. Cheapest transport at  HK$2.3 (adults) and HK$1.2 (for kids 3-11yrs).\n\nThanks, Fion, for a pleasant stay in Hong Kong, and for your quick responses.\n\nCheers\nThe Wees"},{"_id":"355852892","date":{"$date":"2018-12-06T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"27719896","reviewer_id":"220053118","reviewer_name":"Benedict","comments":"Fion is hospitable and accommodative, the place is definitely of great value for its number of people it can house along with an amazing location with mtr closeby and great eateries! there is stable and good wifi as well! definitely recommend if you are staying in HK!"},{"_id":"360024265","date":{"$date":"2018-12-19T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"27719896","reviewer_id":"217232339","reviewer_name":"Syawal Suboh","comments":"It is considered huge in the town.

She took me under her wing there in the big, scary (for this Atlantan) Big Apple, and turned my visit there into a cozy, homey, few days filled with good conversation, plenty of food, and, surprisingly, lots of R\u0026R.\nAs a hotel employee, I had options available to me at employee rates at several NYC properties. I booked there initially, to stay while I attended a much looked-forward-to event.\nI then decided, just for exploring options, to peruse what offerings were available on Airbnb. That's when I found Jeani's place. Turned out, her place was literally across the street from my event's venue.\nDelightful experience. So glad my decisions led me to Jeani's door.\nNow back in Atlanta, I show everyone I can pictures of my time at Jeani's.\nIf I ever go back to NYC, you can know I'll be calling upon Jeani again."},{"_id":"138373656","date":{"$date":"2017-03-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2774934","reviewer_id":"119459490","reviewer_name":"Elise","comments":"Loved this stay, so easy and pleasant.

The bathroom is spacious and the shower is great. My favorite thing about this place was my ability to walk anywhere I was interested in going. It's right next to the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, Columbus Circle, numerous places to eat, and it was a 20-25 minute walk to the theatres. It's also near a subway station and if you're going through Newark International Airport, it's a super easy trip using the subway and NJ Transit. I know that I wanted to incentivize myself to go out and explore the city and this place was the perfect spot to change, sleep, and shower, so I could prepare for the next event.

My boyfriend, who is a chef, and I stayed here and had everything we needed in the kitchen to cook a few great meals. Nice efficient setup of a completely renovated space in old building, with clean and lovely touches - feels like a fresh hotel room. I normally stay in quirky older places (which often have a few strange limitations that I can live with) but this place had a clean and new freshness that I really appreciated as a traveler, mixed into an older historical context. Also, Abel was always friendly and quick to respond, and let me leave my bags in the room before actual check in time, which helped me out greatly. The apartment looks exactly like the pictures - plus good internet and full cable tv. Definintely a good deal, recommended!"}]}

I’ve seen this listing many times but availability never worked out with our schedule. This time, Brendan and Stephanie were lifesavers! \r\n\r\nEight months pregnant with twins we were fleeing from another Airbnb place that was not as advertised and overpriced. Stephanie \u0026 Brendan’s place was the perfect oasis! Exactly what they advertise is what you experience with the bonus of a great overall vibe. They are warm, generous, and genuine hosts. Their kids, Gabby \u0026 Sal, are well behaved and delightful to be around. My husband enjoyed sharing his culture (Japan) and I taught them a few useful Japanese words. Several nights we watched movies with the family in their home theatre. Sho \u0026 Brendan became fast friends bonding over cars and shopping runs. We were fortunate to be the first guests to experience a new upgraded King size bed—wish we had one!  So comfy! Since I was on bed rest, my husband spent a lot of time in their spacious kitchen cooking. One morning the kids invited us to join them for chocolate chip pancakes, YUM! We had everything we could possible need and more. We feel that we are now part of their family. \r\n\r\nTheir home is clean and spacious. The design of the house allows for several guests without feeling crowded (actually, we seldom even saw or heard other guests). Our recommendation: 200%, both thumbs up! An important lesson learned: Avoid new Airbnb listings. Stephanie and Brendan have been hosting people for 7 yrs or more. Through experience, Brendan was quite right when he encouraged us to resolve our disappointment with our previous lodging (hosts new to Airbnb) by calling Airbnb. We were extremely pleased with Airbnb’s customer service. \r\n\r\nThank you Stephanie, Brendan, Gabby \u0026 Sal! You have an open invitation to visit us in Japan anytime!\r\n本当にありがとうございました｡とても快適に滞在することができました｡また､機会がありましたら必ずご連絡をいたします｡\r\nCheers,\r\nSho \u0026 Cat (+ Angelina \u0026 Viviana...coming soon)"},{"_id":"13150405","date":{"$date":"2014-05-20T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"279189","reviewer_id":"10530493","reviewer_name":"Brandon","comments":"Brendan and Stephanie are awesome!

Great place to watch tv or movies if you don't want to in your room. They are super knowledgeable about all the different areas, as I picked their brains about a ton of stuff. Their house is in a great location - we thought it was pretty central to everything and convenient to highway access. We were happy to stumble upon some good food finds in the area too! And don't be scared of the driveway. I was about 6 1/2 months preggo while we visited, and I made it up, so you can too! ;) We also had a good amount of luggage because of relocation, and they were super accommodating with that as well.

I can't believe I ever felt apprehensive about staying at an Airbnb for a month.  It already feels like I left my home and my family at 'Ohana Nui.  I moved to Hawaii with my girlfriend and we had no idea what we were doing.  We stayed with Brendan and his family, and they immediately put our worries at ease and helped us harness our laid-back,  island mentality.  Brendan provided us an incredible amount of amenities.  Forgot your snorkel gear?  He's got you covered.  Forgot your shampoo and conditioner?  He's got you covered.  Ever wanted to try ghost pepper sauce?  He's got you covered.  Ever wanted to pilot a helicopter? He's got you covered.  There's so many things I can say about Brendan but I think the most important thing for Lindsey and me is, without Brendan and Ohana Nui, I don't think I would have been able to survive that first month and make Hawaii my new home.  My highlights were: coffee and pog juice on the lanai every morning (with the incredible view of Palolo Valley), dinner with the family, movie nights, meeting all the awesome guests that Brendan approves for the other rooms (we actually found our new roommate from 'Ohana Nui!), and the bus stop that is right across the street from the house.

Staying there was one of the many highlights of my trip and I know where I’m staying the next time I head back there!\n "},{"_id":"45368486","date":{"$date":"2015-09-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"279189","reviewer_id":"27571923","reviewer_name":"Thierry","comments":"Nous avons passé 1 mois chez Brendan qui nous a très bien reçu.

I came to Honolulu on businesses but wanted to maximize my Hawaii experience while I visited. This place offered just that with a quiet atmosphere during the night and friendly guests throughout the day. I went hiking, dinning, and (attempted) surfing with multiple of the other guests (I was busy when Brendan himself did events). This house had everything I needed from the get-go to include laundry supplies, basic toiletries, beach gear, etc. This place was perfect.

It's hard to cover all the reasons why we had such a great time but here goes:\r\n\r\nWhen we first arrived, Brendan asked if we'd like to ride along to the beach - so it only took about 1.5 hours from landing in Hawaii to having my feet in the sand. He also helped out by giving my partner a lift to shop for groceries on our first night, while I was having a jetlag nap! and another time when I needed a coffee shop to (literally) chill in while writing an essay.\r\n\r\nThe location has gorgeous views - it's on the side of a hill looking into/over a valley - and is away from all the hustle and bustle of the tourist areas, so you can choose to engage or disengage with them. Word to the carless (which we were): it does take a considerable time to get to these tourist areas, including beaches and big malls, so we used Uber when we went there, and occasionally buses (very economical but very long transit times). So if you are envisaging trotting down to the beach/blowing megabucks every day without a car and you don't like the sound of either of these options, this may not be the location for you. (All the more for us!)\r\n\r\nPretty much every amenity you could want is provided - fully equipped kitchen, some toiletries and sunscreen etc., water bottles and a basket of snacks in your mini fridge on arrival, a big TV with Netflix. But aside from all of this, what we really loved was getting to know everyone at the house, hanging out in the evenings/mornings and having a laugh. It really is like staying with extended family. That said, a lot of the time we chilled out by ourselves, and that was completely possible to do as well.\r\n\r\nBonus great things: we were given really lovely, completely unexpected farewell gifts, and one night, Asti baked not one, but two delicious banana breads. I highly recommend, if you stay here, to leave some bananas lying around ;) Plus outings with other guests were delightful! \r\n\r\nIf you want to hang out with lovely people in a lovely location for ridiculously good value, let me tell you, this is the place to go. Mahalo guys; we'll be back!"},{"_id":"101545981","date":{"$date":"2016-09-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"279189","reviewer_id":"90552241","reviewer_name":"Brittany","comments":"My stay at Brendan's place was great! I was staying here while I found a place to live on the island to go to school, and Brendan did nothing but help in every way that he could. He gave great advice about what to do on the island, activities, stores, and restaurants/food. Brendan, Asti, and the kids are so sweet and happy! They really make you feel welcome!\r\n\r\nThe description of the room and house are pretty much 100% accurate. There is snorkel gear and boogie boards to use, along with a full kitchen with anything you may need. The guests in the other rooms are from all around the world and it's fun to meet them all as they come and go. \r\n\r\nThe neighborhood is not right in the city, so it's more quiet that way, and the bus stop is just a few hundred steps away, so it's pretty easy to get around. By car, Waikiki is about 15minutes away. Although it's street parking, I never had any problem finding space to park.\r\n\r\nOverall, my experience here was great and I am so glad I went with an Airbnb instead of a hotel. I felt more at home and I didn't feel as lonely because there were people to talk to and hang out with. I have already recommended this place to my family and friends when they come to the island to visit me!"},{"_id":"106900505","date":{"$date":"2016-10-08T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"279189","reviewer_id":"3962400","reviewer_name":"Paresha","comments":"Brendan was fantastic.

My windows don’t open in my room, so I had the option to use a fan or a very effective air conditioner that could run up my electric bill, but that usage is optional for anyone staying in the room. Don’t use the air conditioner and the price stays down or completely eliminated, I just liked mine to be an ice box which could be pricier.

It’s a 30-minute drive to Waikiki but there are also some cool bars which are about less than 10 minutes away from Brendan’s place. It has a steep driveway but I managed to walk even on my wedge shoes so I didn’t see it as a problem. If you stay over on Valentine’s day, you’re in for a surprise (thanks for the chocolates!). Room doesn’t have a window that you can open; ventilation comes from the fan or door so don’t even think about bringing in stinky food to your room (it’s common sense anyway). I’ll recommend this place to my friends."}]}

Danielle kept asking if we needed anything, and was very responsive to requests. Our family of 5 adults stayed 9 nights in January and we never needed the ACs because of the fans and the breezes, and the roof fan in the living room quickly pulled out hot air in the late afternoon. My parents loved doing tai chi on the balcony overlooking the canal, and my husband and I enjoyed the easy kayaking out to the ocean \u0026 back. The unit is a very short drive to stores and nearby beaches, but it's not walkable to the beach and parking is difficult at Kailua beaches on weekends or during high season. One thing that was not a big deal for us but might be for others, is that there was no door between the master bathroom and master bedroom (at least during our stay). Also, the kitchen is stocked with many things for cooking, but not as much as other units of this size (e.g., not as many pans and cooking utensils), but Danielle lent us a few things.

We are extremely grateful for all that they did for us during our stay, and also blessed to have met such a great family.  Everyday they would say, \"Make yourself at home\" or \"My home is your home\".  We stayed with this wonderful family for 14 days while we searching for permanently living on Oahu, as we relocated and didn't want to jump into anything too quickly.

The area is up against a pretty mountain and the creek and bird sounds make for great sleeping. While the house is small for the number of residents (Mellissa, Cabral, their cute 2 year old and a newborn baby), they made such an effort so that we had complete access to the shared bathroom. Kitchen and common area were a bit tricky due to the number of adults and children in the house. We (a couple) traveled with a 9 month old baby. We were housebound during the evenings (after putting the baby to sleep), but could not stay in our room (for fear of waking the our baby).

I had the opportunity to meet Melissa's parents, they are both very nice people. Although we had to share bathroom with other guests, the bathroom is very clean. If I have to say a negative thing, it might not be ideal if you are on honeymoon or looking for quietness and privacy. But if you want to meet people and make friends, this is a good option."},{"_id":"24927696","date":{"$date":"2015-01-04T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"279986","reviewer_id":"2833213","reviewer_name":"Erin","comments":"Melissa and Frank's home in Kailua was absolutely wonderful! We were checked in by their assistant who was very helpful and friendly. The first thing you will notice is how open and clean their house is. Like most homes in Hawaii the \"no shoes\" policy in the house keeps everything very clean which was refreshing. \n\nThe room we stayed in was nicely  designed and extremely clean. At the foot of the bed they have an ottoman that has bath and beach towels to use. A small fridge is in the room for food also. \n\nThey openly offer snorkel gear, body boards and various  beach equipment free of charge, and invite you to email them about renting the foam longboards in the backyard.\n\nOverall, our three night stay at Melissa and Frank's was an incredible experience!

The house is well set up with plenty of common space for guests including a large back yard. They mostly use the upstairs so we were able to use the lounge and dining area at our leisure, however the kitchen is not overly for guest use.\r\nThe location is fantastic for the beach - an 8 minute walk - and is set in a very quiet and safe neighbourhood. We didn't have a car and walking to town takes a good 25minutes - great exercise! - but if you want to be near restaurants/shops, you'd be better off staying closer to Kailua Beach Park.\r\n\r\nThe downsides are the thin doors on the rooms which can make it noisy, and one bathroom for up to 6 people. Mostly these things were not an issue and we didn't have to wait.\r\n\r\nWe took advantage of their airport pick up/drop off (included with a 2-day car rental) and this was a great help. Melissa and Cabral were kind enough to accommodate our early arrival and late flight out.\r\nThanks!"},{"_id":"26137270","date":{"$date":"2015-02-04T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"279986","reviewer_id":"8177476","reviewer_name":"Kristy","comments":"Frank and Melissa were great hosts.

Bright, spacious and clean, it was conveniently located to some of the most beautiful white sand/turquoise beaches (Lanikai) and was a short trip to the North shore and Honolulu. The hosts were very attentive to us, making sure to give us recommendations and had coffee/tea and oatmeal packets available for breakfast. There is a small bar fridge in the room and suited our needs to store our food/snacks over the next few days. Beach chairs, snorkel gear and boogie boards were available too! We took them up on their offer to rent the car, which was very convenient and Cabral dropped us back off at the airport even though it was pass checkout and was quite late. We even tried to get a surfing lesson but the ocean didn’t cooperate. We’ll be back for that surfing lesson, Cabral! Mahalo to you and your family!

Honestly Melissa and Frank were the best hosts that we could have ever asked for. During our stay we felted like welcome guests in their spacious home. We only saw Frank and Melissa a handful of times, but when we did they were both eager to hear about our trip as well as give some recommendations as to what we might like to do. Their house has a nice open concept with wide open doors out towards the backyard letting in the warm ocean breeze :) They offered us use of their  personal beach chairs, coolers, towels, boogie board and umbrella (this was a game changer on those warm beach days) The house never felt crowded as people came and went. Every morning we were greeted with a fresh pot of coffee and a \"recommendation of the day\". We didn't do everything that they suggested, but the things we did do were awesome. The Thursday night market in Kailua is a must BTW! Their kids are a delight and were so cute and even got to know our names :) A few other amenities worth mentioning is: use of their fully stocked kitchen(perfect for that quick breakfast after a trip to Whole Foods Market), clean bathroom with shampoo, conditioner, and body wash, easy access to parking (we rented a car), close to nearby shopping (Target, Whole Foods, Macys, Longs Drugs, Gas Stations, etc... as well as only a quick walk or drive to the beach, convenient feet rinsing station in the back of the house for getting rid of the sand on your feet. \r\n\r\nAll in all I would give this Airbnb a 5/5.

All restaurants are close by and the beach is just 8 mins walk... The good thing is they have boards, snorkel equipment, beach umbrellas and chairs that you can borrow which saves a lot of trouble of renting from the beach...The room was nice with 2 bed side fans in addition to the ceiling fan which really helps in summers although it wasn't too hot when we visited...Just had 2 small hiccups... We had damp towels which didn't smell good which was fixed by the hosts...

The location is prime located on the more relaxed, quieter side of the island. Everything for basic necessities like groceries, restaurants, and convenience items are a quick 5 minute drive casually cruising the Kailua neighborhoods. The beach is the big draw and they were helpful pointing me to the residential access points so parking was a breeze and the beach much less crowded! \nCouple things to note: Room is only cooled down with a tower fan and open window for air circulation. I would say it felt 10-15 warmer in the room than outside. I come from San Francisco where it's cooler but nonetheless it didn't take much to break a sweat. I slept with no blankets and the fan directly on me all night. \nThe other item to note is the shower head sits at about 5'6 and is mounted to the side wall. Being 6'3 it at least made me say a few extra prayers while getting myself clean! (aka I had to duck down or go on my knees) \n\nAll in all great people, great location, at a great price compared to getting s hotel! I really enjoyed this calmer side of the island and found myself interacting with way more native islanders who enthusiastically shared their insights about great places to hike, surf, and beach all over the island. \nThanks again for being great hosts! \n-Tim"},{"_id":"91436171","date":{"$date":"2016-08-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"279986","reviewer_id":"9281542","reviewer_name":"Caroline","comments":"Maison très sympa, on s'y sent tout de suite bien, tout est impeccable.

They provided towels and shampoo/conditioner/etc. They provide a mini fridge and fan, but the room was about 10 degrees warmer than the outside temp since there is no air flow with the door closed.\nFor us, the house had quite an empty, tippy-toeing-around feeling. What I mean by this is you walk into the big dining room/kitchen through the side patio door and your room and a couple others and bathroom is to the left. It's quiet and personally, a little too quiet for my wife and I (there are small kids in the house who go to school, so there are signs about not slamming doors, which I get, but the house has tile floors, minimal furniture, and is big, so everything makes noise). The living room with the tv and couch, I'm assuming, is through the doors on the right...we never went that way as we came late and weren't shown that part of the house, so we chose to eat our dinner and watch our own shows in our room on our ipad. \nI'd recommend this place if you have small kids (it has a pool!) or just using it as a base to sleep which is why it worked for us since we had a lot of things planned and weren't there very often.

No water views, but the mountain view is actually better seeing the changing light on the ridges. The place has all amenities for a short or longer stay including a generous deck we didn't have much time to use. It's clean and not overly decorated, which suited us fine. It's easy to find and get in and out of with Likelike, Pali Hwy and H3 all nearby. Thus, it's conveniently located to get to the North, South and West side of the island while being in a not so touristy low-key spot. Having lived in the area before, we found Kaneohe little changed in regards to restaurants and cafes, a bit unexciting. However, Kailua has some good gems for eating, coffee and small store shopping and it's just a quick 10-minute drive away. So is one of the best beaches on the island, so all in one spot if you want it. Why not stay in Kailua then? Unless you are waterfront, the views can leave you a bit wishing. And yes, there is a rooster that crows early in the morning. However, we didn't find it to be a problem and went right back to sleep. Just makes things feel a bit more local, the whole reason to stay in an AirBnB.

A great touch was the wee welcome book - full of little useful details like local supermarkets, nearby recommended events, nearby takeaways - together with a selection of tourist guides and a subway map. Heating and fans are available if you need them, and the heater definitely works fine (although due to the milder weather at the end of the week, wasn't needed that much!)\r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood was absolutely fine to stay in - the Bronx has a reputation but it never felt unsafe or unwelcoming during my time there. The only trouble I had was on the High Line in central Manhattan!

We had never done the Airbnb thing so, honestly, we were a little nervous. But, it felt like we hit the jackpot. We loved Caroline's place.  It's was just as described.  Very cool.  Very fun to be in.   We loved being in a neighborhood that was a good taste of every day NYC.   \r\n\r\nCaroline did a great job of making things easy.  She responded quickly to questions. Kept a great and patient attitude even when I'm sure the questions felt dumb ;)  \r\n\r\nMinor negative is unrelated to Caroline or the loft.   The rooftop was GREAT - but not accessible early mornings or late night (open from 8 to 10:30).  Wish I could have used it more.

It was a great stay. The only things were the wifi was a bit slow and the area was a little sketch. You definitely don't want to be walking around the Bronx after the sun goes down it seems.

Her \"welcome\" book was helpful for getting the wifi password, finding a place or two to eat, knowing checkout procedures, and so on. \r\n\r\nThe apartment itself was very nice for the price, and was clean, comfortable, and very spacious for a studio apartment. Keep in mind that there is no kitchen table so be prepared to eat your breakfasts at the counter standing up or on the couch, etc.  The kitchen had the basic necessities of dishes, silverware, very basic cooking utensils, skillet, pots/pans, cutting board, knives, dish soap, sponges, and kitchen towels. The bed was very soft and comfortable and can be slid around a bit if desired.\r\n\r\nThe apartment's location in the Bronx was a little less \"up and coming\" than we had anticipated and was largely industrial with many auto repair shops just across and down the street. It's also right by an on-ramp to a busy road and traffic did add a good bit of noise. The walk to the nearest subway station (the 6 local train at 138th st. and 3rd ave) takes about 8 minutes from the front door of the building but you can transfer to the 4 or 5 express trains at the next station downtown (125th st.) Not many people are walking around on the surrounding streets after 9pm or so.\r\n\r\nLucky for us, there was ample back-angled parking right in front of the building and while there is a sign stating that street cleaning occurs Monday and Thursday at lunchtime we did not have to move our car during our weeklong stay. Perhaps with the holidays and snow the street cleaning was behind schedule. We also enjoyed eating at Charlie's Bar and Restaurant in the bottom of the building. We recommend the burger and fries (ask for them crispy). Best fries I've had in a long time!\r\n\r\nOverall, we found Caroline's place a good and affordable option for visiting the city. We spent the majority of our time in Manhattan but did explore as far south as the Statue of Liberty and as far north as Washington Heights and Fort Tryon Parks. Caroline's is a nice apartment to come back to at the end of a long day of walking and just relax, read a book, and recharge for the next day of adventures.

The subway is just a short walk away from the apartment, and will only take you 20 mins to get into Manhattan. \nWe really loved our stay here and we can't wait to come back!\nThanks again Caroline, it's been a pleasure! \nHannah and Adam, Nottingham UK."},{"_id":"199416567","date":{"$date":"2017-10-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2814931","reviewer_id":"93536184","reviewer_name":"Vivian","comments":"房型非常不错,但是入住时没有洗浴用品,纸巾也只有一点点,我们只能自己去购买｡在沙发上睡了两晚后,身上许多地方被不知道是螨虫还是跳蚤咬的脓包,直到回到国内两周后才治愈｡房子沿街,一直有车子开过,非常吵闹｡"},{"_id":"201647196","date":{"$date":"2017-10-08T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2814931","reviewer_id":"105192646","reviewer_name":"Ornashuman1","comments":"It is exactly as beautiful and spacious as seen in the photos (only better in 3D :))\nThe bed is very comfortable, The sheets extra soft and lovely, The towels are huge. very clean, well lit (no shatters or curtains - as seen).

She also left all sorts of brochures to various attractions. The neighborhood is fairly safe. It is right outside the bad neighborhood though so don’t wander too far off. The subway is only about a block away which isn’t too bad. The WiFi sucks when you connect to it with your cellphone but works perfectly fine on laptops.
