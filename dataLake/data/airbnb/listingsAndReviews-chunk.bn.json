I stayed three weeks because I used Porto to work on a project and José made me feel so welcome that I was really sad I had to leave again. I will definitely go back because Porto is a beautiful (underestimated) city - not to mention the coffee, the wine, the weather.  The apartment itself is tastefully furnished and decorated. The bed is really cosy and you even have your own balcony with afternoon sun. If you go to Porto (you should!) stay at José's place. You wont't regret it. If your are lucky he will take you out and show you some of Porto's nicest bars (which are just a 20 minute walk away from the apartment) or this table football place behind the steel door.

(아마 전 날 숙박객이 없어서 이른 체크인이 가능했던 것 같아요) 떠나는 날도 오후 늦게 비행기를 타야 했는데, Jose가 배려해 주어서 낮 12시 쯤에 체크아웃을 할 수 있었어요.\r\n참, 그리고 제가 영어를 그리 잘 하지는 못하는데, Jose가 알아 듣기 쉬운 영어를 구사해서 의사소통 하기에 불편함이 없었습니다. \r\n숙소는 사진에 나온 것과 같았구요. 오래 전에 지어진 집과 앤틱 가구와 빈티지 소품들, Jose의 작품들이 어우러져 아름다운 분위기였어요. 테라스가 있어서 아침에 바깥 풍경을 보며 커피를 마셨던 것도 좋았습니다. 부엌에는 필요한 조미료(소금,후추,올리브유 등) 들이 갖추어져 있어서 간단한 요리를 해 먹기에 좋았고, 세탁기가 있어서 빨래도 할 수 있었습니다.(세제는 개인 지참)\r\n머무는 3박4일 동안 부족함 없이 편안히 지낼 수 있었고, 집주인이 같은 건물에 거주하고 있어서 필요한 게 있거나 궁금한게 있을 때면 언제든 물어볼 수 있어 좋았습니다. 포르투에 여행하러 가는 친구가 있다면 jose의 집을 추천해 주고 싶어요.

We did have a problem with the WiFi on our last day, he sent us some help without avail and since José was out-of-town it could not be completely fixed.

Seine beeindruckenden Portraits, die im ganzen Haus und im Apartment verteilt sind, verleihen dem Ganzen einen sehr individuellen Charakter. José war immer für uns da wenn wir Fragen oder Hilfe brauchten und hat uns gute Tipps gegeben, wo und wie wir \"sein Porto\" kennenlernen können.

The check-in was a breeze despite checking in at 3am. On top of that, Tanielle left us some surprises on our arrival and that was a pretty nice touch of hospitality there. Much appreciated Taneille!! \n\nLocation wise, the apartment is perfect. Nicely tucked away in a quiet neighbourhood, yet just a stop or two away from the central buzz and party scene. If you're into nature, there's a Victoria's peak just nearby. However though, I think there are better hikes elsewhere and Tanielle will easily recommend some :) \n\nThere's 7/11, an international market and several local small eateries nearby (if you need something more international, there're Macdonalds and Starbucks). \n\nThe apartment was clean and comfortable. There's basically anything you need in a home and everything was working well - from TV, washing machine, detergent, hot water, air conditioning, iron, kettle, stove etc. And of course we love the (Hidden by Airbnb) Home. Try saying bye to (Hidden by Airbnb) when you leave to get a cute response. \n\nWill definitely recommend anyone to stay here!

I am a public radio DJ with a Brazilian music radio program for the last 30 years.  I am also a story teller and have a knack for making people laugh. \r\n\r\nI love the outdoors and especially cycling up to the Christ statue or in the hills above Silicon Valley.  I am very familiar with the musical scene of Rio and can be your guide or give you the information you need.\r\n\r\nI am a native English speaker and speak fluent Portuguese and passable Japanese.  I also can make myself understood in Spanish.\r\n\r\nMy philosophy as a host:  My parents were very successful small business owners with a carnation farm and later a flower shop. They had their business listed in the best of Silicon Valley and even had local TV coverage.  Out of hundreds of similar businesses, they were able to differentiate themselves on how they treated and interacted with their customers.  They worked hard to give that little extra that made people want to come back.  My goal as a host is to treat as you my parents would have.  Let me show my definition of hospitality.  \r\n\r\nMoro entre o Rio de Janeiro e nos suburbos de San Francisco, em Califórnia. Sou um DJ de rádio educativo com um programa de Música Brasileira para os últimos 30 anos. \r\n\r\nEu gosto de pedalar na floresta da Tijuca subindo para o Corcovado ou nas colinas de Silicon Valley em California. Conheço bem a cena musical do Rio e possa o seu guia ou dar-lhe as informações sobre o que você deveria fazer na Cidade Maravilhosa.\r\n\r\nEu falo inglês e português fluentemente. Eu também entendo bastante espanhol e japônes para comunicar.\r\n\r\nMinha filosofia como anfitrião: meus pais eram proprietários de pequena empresa muito bem sucedido com um sítio de floricultura e depois uma loja de flores. Eles tinham seus negócios listados no melhor de \"Silicon Valley\" e até tinham cobertura de TV local. Das centenas de empresas similares, eles conseguiram se diferenciar com o atendimento único aos seus clientes. Eles trabalharam um pouco mais para fazer os clientes sempre voltar. Meu objetivo como anfitrião é tratar como você teria os meus pais.

Air-conditioning is a useful benefit when temperatures are high. There is a wide variety of good restaurants within easy walking distance and some, including a few close to the apartment have samba music on the weekends. Noise can be a challenge if early sleep is a prerequisite!  John tries hard to be a helpful host, seems to know Rio quite well and has created a useful advisory on local restaurants and tourist destinations in and around the city as well travel alternatives for visitors. John lives in California and this was the first time we had rented from a landlord who lives abroad. When something needs attention, as will be the case from time to time, it is harder to reach him, being in another country. However, he is attentive through his intermediaries when he becomes aware of an issue. The condo is on the seventh floor of an older building with two elevators which are not always reliable. We had an unfortunate and stressful experience through being stuck in the main elevator for almost 90 minutes. It is now out of commission for repairs, so hopefully the problem we experienced will not occur again with any residents or future guests. We had to use the service elevator at the rear of the building for a part of our stay. It is also old and, based on our experience, we naturally wondered about its reliability and maintenance record. Thankfully, it didn’t give us any difficulties. \r\nPutting aside a few unfortunate experiences with this rental, we enjoyed the apartment and the location and appreciated how responsive John tried to be as a caring airbnb host.\r\n"},{"_id":"33916500","date":{"$date":"2015-06-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3040870","reviewer_id":"15270940","reviewer_name":"Samantha","comments":"John and his wife Maria were very accommodating!

It's simply does not get better than this.  The moment we stepped into the apartment, we were drawn to the spectacular view of Copacabana and the mountains.  We're a group of four adults traveling together so having 2 bedrooms and 2 baths is essential.  One of the bathrooms is actually ensuite.  The apartment has all the amenities with washer/dryer, fully equipped kitchen, bottled water dispenser  and beach gear.  There were welcome fruit basket, bread, spread and juice in the refrigerator.  The location could not be better:  the apartment is right across from Copacabana beach and adjacent to the Hilton hotel.  We didn't use public transportation but it is nearby.  We found Uber to be convenient and cost effective especially with sharing the cost amongst four of us.  We felt safe using Uber. Even a taxi ride from GIG to the apartment was very reasonable.  I believe we paid 20 USD.\nThe host , John Ii, is one of the most thoughtful, thorough, and gracious airbnb hosts I have ever met.  He will take care of you: from providing information on restaurants to transportation or anything you may need.  He lives in the Bay Area so communication with him was easy, especially for California residents.  I can't say nice enough things about John. He is just great !"},{"_id":"248413353","date":{"$date":"2018-03-31T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3040870","reviewer_id":"119948940","reviewer_name":"Nicole","comments":"The condo was marvelous!

He is a wealth of knowledge in regard to all things Rio including: food, local escapes, arranging tours, and anything else that you may/may not have thought of doing while in Rio. Because of John's hospitaliity, we will be visiting Rio again!"}]}

The check-in was seamless, despite my concerns about picking up keys from a convenience store. The apartment came with parking -  a real bonus in this area of Sydney. It took me 2 turns to find the carpark, but that was my fault I should have watched the video Angela provided on the day rather than a few days before. The apartment was very well equipped - dishwasher, washing machine and dryer etc. The beds were very comfy. Really good Wifi. \nOn the negative side I was disappointed that we were only given one bath towel each (for a 4 night stay) and a fairly thin towel at that. No hand towels or face washers. The apartment was clean but could probably do with a spruce up as it looked a little tired. \nMy big problem was the TV. It didn't work. When my husband telephoned one of the contact people he received a telephone call back saying that he couldn't help us and would get someone to look at it the next day - a bit too late as we were leaving the next morning. He also told my husband that he had spoken to the Concierge at the building and that a number of apartments were have antenna problems. We then tried to tune  the TV again and were able to \"find\" over 200 channels - but all of them were locked, including the free to air channels. \nMy husband contacted the second contact person and he got back to us and said he couldn't understand why we were having problems as the family that had moved out that morning didn't have any issues. This was a complete lie - we had been in the apartment for the last three nights. \nI don't like people lying to me. Why not simply say that you can't rectify the problem, apologise for the inconvenience and leave it at that.  It wouldn't have been any big deal.\nFinally I don't like hosts asking me (on several occasions) to give them a 5 star rating. I only give honest feedback."},{"_id":"406254424","date":{"$date":"2019-01-28T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"30412858","reviewer_id":"159066790","reviewer_name":"Sarah","comments":"Kind hospitality greets you while this spacious apartment gives you the slightest touch of home.

Your hosts, Sus","neighborhood_overview":"Bronte was recently featured in the New York Times travel article, 36 hours in Sydney. “About a mile south of the more famous Bondi Beach, along a breathtakingly beautiful waterfront walkway is Bronte Beach, a boomerang of golden sand nestled between wind-worn cliffs, a verdant public park and the Tasman Sea.\" The beach also features ocean baths. Take a mask and snorkel and walk to the next beach, Clovelly Beach, to see the protected Blue Gropers or a boogie board to the surf beaches, Coogee, Tamarama and of course, Bondi.  Our street is quiet, even when the beach is very busy on hot days.","notes":"It is located around the corner from Three Blue Ducks, a casual cafe and restaurant opened by three surfer friends that is featured in the 2014 Good Food Guide as one of the best cafe and restaurants  in Sydney's eastern suburbs. There are plenty of cafes and restaurants nearby too: Vietnamese, Italian, Seafood, macrobiotic, modern Australian and much more. Food allergies are catered for if you need gluten free or lactose free breakfast. We try to be sustainable and use recycled products and the garden is watered by a combination of water captured in rainwater tanks and town water. The garden is fertilised by organic compost produced in both compost bins and worm farms. We have Australian native stingless bees that are kept away from the studio that help pollinate the garden. This means that we don't use any pesticides in the garden as we don't want to harm the bees.","transit":"A 2 minute walk to the 440 bus that will deliver you into the city in 20 minutes or 10 mins to Bondi Junction where you can catch the train to the city.","access":"The studio has its own verdant garden of orchids, avocado trees, banana palms and passionfruit vines.

The neighbourhood is beautiful, with some nice local eateries where we had one of the best (and cheapest) steaks we've ever had at Eugene's! Bronte beach is only a 10 minute walk away, and other beaches (including Bondi) can be reached via a gorgeous coastal walkway.

I awoke every morning to the sound of birds and an ocean breeze, and loved relaxing in the beautiful garden space which they have lovingly created. It offers the quintessential Bronte neighborhood experience - 10 mins stroll to the beach, close to the best restaurants and is located in a lovely street full of native flora.\r\n\r\nBut what makes this home really special are the hosts' thoughtful gestures - everything from the breakfast items they left me, through to local tips and suggestions, as well as an invitation to join them for festive celebrations. They are both natural hosts - available if you need assistance but also offer guests privacy and personal space.\r\n\r\nThis is the perfect place to stay at one of Sydney's best beaches (as a single or couple). I look forward to enjoying Susan and Greg's hospitality and friendship again very soon!"},{"_id":"59192507","date":{"$date":"2016-01-08T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3042637","reviewer_id":"30827155","reviewer_name":"Lynne-Marie","comments":"I think this was my favourite place to stay ever.

We spent 3 nights here and loved it. It's situated in a suburban area, about 10 minutes walk down the hill to Bronte beach and to the path which is part of the sublime Coastal Walk which runs from Coogee to Bondi. Its also about 200m easy walk to the local shops where there are several great restaurants, a fabulous sourdough bakery, a pharmacy and delicious coffee. This is also where you catch the bus which runs very regularly and goes into the city and to Central via Bondi Junction. We just left our car parked outside the house and used the bus during our stay which we found very easy and convenient.\nThe accommodation is a small separate studio tucked up the back of Susan and Greg's beautiful garden. It has a generous paved area outside with seating which is under a beautiful big old tree which must be gorgeous in summer. \nThe position of the studio creates a sense of space and privacy. The studio itself is small but roomy. It is fresh, modern, tastefully decorated, exceptionally clean and very comfortable. Every detail has been thought of, from the shampoo and conditioner supplied, to the iron and mini ironing board, the spare towels, the beach towels, tissues, crockery and cutlery, to the lovely simple breakfast, coffee, and herbal teas. There is a reverse cycle A/C, TV and radio. The bed was very comfortable and the shower was great.\nSusan was lovely to deal with, friendly and helpful, and very quick to respond. She and Greg were very welcoming and helpful but then left us to ourselves which is what we like. The studio feels private and separate from the house and is very quiet.

We walked to Bondi and Coogee along the coast, and ate at the local cafes. (Three Blue Ducks was so good we ate there twice.) The studio is set in a lush garden, and has lots of natural light. It's also quiet and cosy - perfect for catching up on sleep. We travelled from Central by train and bus, which took about 40 minutes on average, with one change at Bondi Junction. Susan and Greg were excellent hosts. Greg met us at the house and dropped us at a bakery for lunch so we didn't get rained on, and on our second morning, we found muffins in a basket on our front step.

It was our first time using Airbnb and it was more than we had hoped for. It's a typical small Hong Kong apartment but Frederic has decorated so that we two did not feel cramped at all. Much more spacious than a hotel room. The bed is low but very comfortable. The shower is great. Frederic has photo guides for all the appliances and outlets. The location couldn't be better for central and surprisingly quiet for being on Queen's Road Central. You can easily walk to the Sheung Wan or Central Stations. Hollywood Rd is just up the steps and Soho a few minutes walk down Hollywood Rd. There is a market right next to the building entrance and good restaurants a block away. The best thing is Frederic has arranged for his friend Simon to let you in. Simon orients you to the apartment and the neighborhood. Both Frederic and Simon want to make sure you enjoy the apartment, neighborhood and Hong Kong. And we did. Finally Frederic is great at responding to your emails.
