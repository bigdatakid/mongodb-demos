I am so blessed to offer people from all around the world the chance to experience the breath taking scenery and beautiful culture of an island paradise I have called home for my entire life. My family has been in the vacation rental business for over 30 years and it all started with my grandmother Kay (hence Kay's Ali'i Vacation Rental). Now myself, my mother Brenda, my wife Kristina, and my aunt Lucy have taken over the reins and are continuing the legacy my grandmother started. \r\n\r\nOur families journey in the vacation rental industry started with one small simple unit and slowly evolved into something special for generations to come. We now we have 3 vacation rental properties in Kailua with multiple units on each. Our goal is to offer parties of all sizes the chance to visit our island paradise without having to break their bank accounts. We have 2, 3, \u0026 4 bedroom units for larger groups or extended family getaways. We have 1 bedroom units \u0026 large studios for our guests who are traveling with their immediate family and we also have a private rooms for those of our guests who want to get away by themselves or with their significant other to relax and enjoy our beautiful Hawaiian weather. No matter what group size you have we can accommodate you. Take a look at our listing and feel free to message us.

We notified Brandyn and AirBnB, and all parties quickly remedied the situation. We got into a new AirBnB right away, and Brandyn was able to get in to do some exterminating.

Both an easy walk on foot if you have no small children. Nice quiet local street. \nThe studio apartment had a full kitchen. Everything we needed was in the studio (except a bottle opener!), including suncream, beach towels, hairdryer etc. This studio is quite dated, but was clean. Only thing that may not suit some travellers is how the noise travels. There is an internal door that connects the studio to the main house (but you have your own private entrance, internal door is locked). This internal door is very thin, and we could hear everything that happened in the room beyond the door (entire conversations, cupboards being opened and closed etc). They were not unusually noisy. However I was always concerned about how much noise I may be making, which made it very hard for me to relax. They were never intrusive, but I didn't have the sense of privacy I would prefer as a traveller.

The efficiency was roomy and clean with a large comfortable bed. With its small but practical kitchen it was more than competitive with similar places in the Kailua area. It is situated about half way between the commercial district and the beach. It's a bit of a walk but a quick drive to either. The hosts are there if you need them, they won't bother you if you don't. No problem parking in you have a vehicle. The only issue is a limited amount of hot water from what is evidently a limited capacity for all residents including the hosts. Sometimes there was plenty, sometimes not so much. So unless you just like lukewarm or cold bathing water this can make for an occasional very quick shower. This should not be a deal killer but neither should you be surprised.

Easy way up. Dan gave very clear directions and left instructions for everything. The place was very clean and ready to go, with some pretty good views of the city. We loved the place but think we might have been unlucky as there were issues with the water supply in the building in some of the days we stayed in. While Dan was very responsive, we did have to re-adjust some of our plans because of this. Perhaps not an issue if you do not have a tight agenda when you visit/the water supply problem was a one-off."},{"_id":"214961627","date":{"$date":"2017-11-27T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2228863","reviewer_id":"49435446","reviewer_name":"Sean","comments":"Easy and convenient stay.

The apartment was bigger than expected. Check-in was easy and Dan left a doc with info on the apartment on the coffee table. Nice TV channel selection and strong wifi...the wifi continued to work well even when we had 5+ devices connected. The shower had good water pressure and the water heater worked great. The main bedroom was clean and had more space than anticipated and the bed was very comfortable with a great window view. (The roof access offered great views as well, as Dan's place is in one of the tallest buildings in the area.) The futon in the main room pulled out into a bigger bed and was also great. The living area was of decent size and the extra chairs meant we could have sit-down meals at the table. The kitchen allowed us to cook for ourselves and we appreciated having a variety of cups, plates and silverware to fit our needs. The washer was perfect for a post-hike load and allowed us to pack lighter. Dan was an amazing host himself, and replied quickly to our questions with very helpful answers. The building was quiet (no loud neighbors) and the guys who worked the front desk were very nice and friendly. If I come back to HK, I'd rebook Dan's place as it was a spacious, clean property in a central, convient location with an amazing, responsive host."},{"_id":"224688651","date":{"$date":"2018-01-04T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2228863","reviewer_id":"162691853","reviewer_name":"振东","comments":"整洁干净,各种电器生活用品一应俱全!"},{"_id":"229693615","date":{"$date":"2018-01-25T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2228863","reviewer_id":"25350405","reviewer_name":"Keri","comments":"The perfect home base for our stay in Hong Kong. Dan was an excellent host. From the booking throughout the stay he was always responsive and had great suggestions for seeing the city. We loved being right off the escalator- it was extremely convenient for exploring or getting down to the ifc to catch a ferry. The neighborhood is quiet, but with quick access to restaurants and night life. There was a small grocery store right down the street and an excellent bakery called LeVian. We purchased bread and eggs to make breakfast before heading out for the day. The apartment is well-stocked with dishes and cookware, and the space was comfortable for three adult travelers. We made it up to the rooftop one night to hang out and watch the lights. Super cool private space to experience the city.

Диван очень старый с неприятным запахом, белье и полотенца влажные и с неприятным запахом тоже, кондиционеры шумные, но без них в квартире запах сырости. Не подходит для путешественников с детьми (небезопасные окна, огромное количество стеклянных бутылок на полу). В ванной отличный напор. Мы всегда останавливались в отеле Bishop чуть выше, что и планируем сделать при следующей поездке. Dan был очень мил, отвечал на все вопросы при бронировании.

The bathroom has a bathtub which also was good for the kids. The kitchen had all basic amenities. For Hong Kong standards, his place has a pretty good size.\n\nCheck in and check it went smoothly and easy. Dan is very communicative and fast in responding.

It sits on a ridge immediately east of Woolloomooloo, west of Elizabeth Bay and Rushcutters Bay and north of Darlinghurst. The suburb has a roughly trapezoidal shape, and at its greatest extent is no more than one kilometre long by 200 metres wide. Potts Point's eastern boundary is Macleay Street.

The location is fantastic being a couple of minutes to Kings Cross station and all the amenities the area has. The only thing I would mention is that being so central it can get a bit noisy in the flat, especially as the slatted window in the kitchen doesn't close as far as we could see and there was an air conditioning unit or something on the other side of it. But with ear plugs this didn't bother us too much and all the other excellent points more than made up for it. Thanks Griffin!

Miinuspuolena onkin, että katu/alue oli alkuyöstä usein aika meluisa. Alue on trendikäs ja eläväinen ja se kuului myös asuntoon. Parina ensimmäisenä yönä naapurit pitivät niin kovaa meteliä, että minun oli vaikea nukkua. Kerroin tästä Griffinille, joka lupasi ystävällisesti selvittää, voiko tehdä asialle jotakin. Loppuviikon nukuinkin paremmin, eivätkä naapurit enä häirinneet samalla tavalla.

Griffin was super understanding as well when our flight was canceled last minute! The apartment is located in Kings Cross, really close to the train station which was great and really easy to get to and from the airport. However, it is Kings Cross be warned. One business next to the apartment is an adorable dog grooming parlor and the business on the other side was a gentleman's club...strange mix! However, considering Kings Cross is a \"drinking area\" we had no issues with noise from the street and felt safe walking around at night (there was two of us). There is no aircon in the apartment but the little fan works nicely. Also there is no fly screen on any of the windows which means you have to watch the windows if they are open (think bugs and birds).

This is the only host to use proper pillows that support your neck, thus spine, for a good sleep.\n\nThe accommodation: \nIt is oddly picturesque as a converted garage situated at the bottom of the main house.\n\nThe greatness:\n•Friendly residents. \n•The USB plug socket. \n\nAccommodation Tip: \nThe towel rack is attached to the doorway between the main room and the kitchen.\n\nRecommendations: \nGo to Church Street for those evening vibes. \n\nWhat felt missing from an Airbnb superhost: \nThat welcome home goody bag feeling - this would incident a typical bathroom cup to put one's toothbrush in, cold water in the fridge, a full loaf of bread or dietary snack alternatives with spreads, an option of tea/coffee during the stay; these finer super host experience touch was being missed. However there was the salt and pepper condiments. \n\nThe minutiae of an Airbnb feel was not felt, like a pen and pad, a welcome book with recommended foods and attractions. \n\nThe neutral (for light sleepers): \n1. Only for the well instructed, and using your own power source. Good luck getting your Android to work with the MirrorCast device; don't forget to bring a 2A USB charger. \n2. The 6am singing from the bird wildlife for about 30mins. This is AUS, this should be expected and accepted by residence, otherwise try the CBD. \n3. The road noise in the distance (this is hardly noticed if not sensitive to sound) \n4. As mentioned by the host. The acoustics are not great and you can hear upstairs. This made it into the next category below.\n\nThe not so satisfying: \nUnfortunately as the accommodation is a conversion of the ground floor on the property, you can clearly hear the TV, conversations, wonderful chimes from the doorbell and footsteps through the front door from the property owner(s) upstairs. \n• The accommodation does not retain heat. \n• The digital signal for the TV in the accommodation always cuts off. \n• Bowls are provided :-) , but there are no larger size bowls... :-( \n• The accommodation door does not stop a cold  draught \n• The Wi-Fi is a home network. If you're able to connect, you will be sharing your devices visibility over the router during busy times with the others in the above property. You can accidentally play your music/videos to the wrong TV or speaker and shock the people in the building upstairs. This is also a security issue for the tech. savvy. \n• There's only one mirror and one sink, it is head height and is only in the kitchenette-shower. \n•The bed blanket visually looks like it has seen better days. \n• Bring your own coffee capsules for the machine."},{"_id":"307662269","date":{"$date":"2018-08-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"22297561","reviewer_id":"53640004","reviewer_name":"Kathy","comments":"Overall is good"},{"_id":"309862817","date":{"$date":"2018-08-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"22297561","reviewer_id":"207512997","reviewer_name":"Chamika","comments":"Sam is a wonderful host.

I’ve sent this comments to the owner but we haven’t received any response or assistance. \n\nThe place was very dirty. It Looks this hasn’t been cleaned to receive people. Actually it looks it has not been cleaned in a while.\n\nThere were cockroaches all around the place, mainly in the living room and the kitchen.\n \nBed clothes in the Bedroom were used (you expect clean sheets when you book a place)\n\nSitting in a sofa so dirty is disgusting. And the tv and electronics were not properly connected to use. Everything is full of dust and dirtiness.\nWe had to clean the chairs and table to be able to use them. \n\nThe add says “breakfast provided” but that was not been arranged.\n\nThe humidity smell is really bad and it should be a comment in the description warning about that before booking.\n\nTo sum up, our stay in this place was not pleasant. We came with a lot of expectations to have a good time for new year in Sydney. This is the first time I have a bad experience with Airbnb.\n\nMy family want to have a good time and don’t want to waste all our days being uncomfortable. \nThey asked me to move to a clean place from the beginning. This was a big problem because booking with no anticipation here, these days is very difficult to find and also is very expensive. I would like to cancel from the first day but we couldn’t find another place until now.\n\nI’m claiming for the full refund plus the cleaning fees since this apartment hasn’t been cleaned for receiving us. I also ask for the service fees to compensate this really bad experience. \n\nThis is the first time I have a bad experience booking a place with Airbnb. I know this is just an isolated case and I trust that the company will resolve my dispute fairly."}]}

Flamengo beach is just in front of the building - with beach walks and outdoor gyms. The Flamengo area is a \"real\" local area, not a touristy one, and there are lots of supermarkets (really, lots and lots!) cafés, restaurants etc closeby. The beaches of Copacabana and Ipanema are only a close metro ride away (metro is safe and clean and just 2,5 blocks away). Centro is only 4 km away - it's walkable (if it's not too hot). \n\nThe flat itself is narrow with lots of stairs - i.e. not recommended for persons with mobility issues. There are two bedrooms and a sofa bed in the living room, and they provide plenty of sheets and towels. It had everything we needed in terms of equipment. There are ACs in both bedrooms and a fan in the living room. And you can see the Christ statue from the balcony! \n\nElias is a great host, he was very attentive the whole time and helped us with anything we needed. He even stocked up the fridge for us since we arrived late one Saturday evening during Carnival. He really went out of the way to be helpful!"},{"_id":"161544864","date":{"$date":"2017-06-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"223200","reviewer_id":"67931260","reviewer_name":"Robson","comments":"Ótima localização, totalmente fiel às imagens publicadas, tudo muito bom.

Wilson’s home is almost complete of amenities; has a stock of garbage bags, salt, adaptors, tissues, towels, body wash and liquid hand soap. Although we were hoping to use the laundry, it was one of the major factors that we looked forward to since we were staying for 7 days but the washing machine was broken, we were advised after we checked in. We met Wilson when we checked in and he was very welcoming and accommodating. When we had a problem with the induction in the middle of 2am, he replied instantly and provided us resolution as soon as after lunch the next day. We weren’t able to cook food for a day, but it’s alright because overall our stay at Wilson’s home is fantastic!

We had clean towels and sheets provided, and the bathroom had everything we needed. \nIt was clean but it was an older unit, which I think people can sometimes mistake for dirty (based on previous reviews I read).\n\nWe were able to park our car on one half of the shared driveway, being sure to leave the other half of the driveway for Agata and her family to access their garage + home (which backs into to the unit and the garage provides their access to their home). There was also street parking though. We had a brief interaction with Agata and her family by chance as we were heading out one day, which was very pleasant. Agata was very kind and hospitable, however was sure not to be a presence during our stay.\n\nSince our stay fell on a warm time of the year, it did get quite hot inside in the afternoon and evening. There is no air con, just a pedestal fan which was in the bedroom. Which could be moved about if you needed it in the lounge room. However I feel in summer it would get super hot inside.\n\nOur two dogs felt right at home there - there is a good outdoor space perfect for dogs (secure gate and fences, small grass patches with trees, and a large secure deck area).  There is also a park about a 10 minute walk away from the unit which was great!!\n\nThank you for welcoming us and our two dogs into your home Agata. We had a great trip and appreciated the convenient location \u0026 solid base for our time in Sydney."},{"_id":"351755509","date":{"$date":"2018-11-23T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"22323221","reviewer_id":"204263658","reviewer_name":"Brandon","comments":"Super easy and pleasant owner, handy location"},{"_id":"353626678","date":{"$date":"2018-11-28T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"22323221","reviewer_id":"27382459","reviewer_name":"Peter","comments":"Great host"},{"_id":"355806746","date":{"$date":"2018-12-05T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"22323221","reviewer_id":"21035859","reviewer_name":"Thomas","comments":"Had a great stay, thanks!"},{"_id":"358554921","date":{"$date":"2018-12-14T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"22323221","reviewer_id":"223265032","reviewer_name":"頔","comments":"房子周边很安静,道路两边都可以停车｡屋内设施齐全,厨房用具都很干净｡会推荐朋友们也来选择此房源｡"},{"_id":"407366173","date":{"$date":"2019-02-02T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"22323221","reviewer_id":"9045722","reviewer_name":"Christine","comments":"I stayed at Agata’s place for the first three weeks after I moved to Sydney, and I absolutely loved the apartment.

The place felt very much like home right away, and it’s close to buses and local shops and restaurants. Buses take less than 30 minutes to the beach and the city, and UNSW and Randwick village are both within walking distance. The bed is comfortable and the TV has Netflix, while both the kitchen and bathroom is equipped with all the basics (such as shampoo, soap, toothpaste, essential toiletries, washing powder, milk, oil, salt, pepper, etc.). Agata was a fabulous host: she was quick to respond to requests (such as replacing the bug spray when it ran out), and kindly received some mail for me too.

The community has great coffee shops, a grocery, excellent bakery, liquor store all within a 15 minute walk to UNSW campus.   This apartment is EXCELLENT for visiting scholars to UNSW and I strongly recommend it.  The wifi is excellent and if any problems come up, Agata responds quickly to help.  The great outdoor space is a huge plus and the privacy of the unit makes you feel like you have your own home.  It is close to multiple public transit stops to get you where you need to go, and a nice 30 minute walk to the beach.  We were visited by a few spiders and beetles, but once again Agata responded quickly to help and had left bug spray in the unit to handle any unwanted guests.  I would happily return to Agata's unit for a repeat visit to the university."}]}

Frederick and Kloe were very responsive and accommodating and if we go back to Montreal I would definitely stay there again. Checking in was easy. We actually stayed in for dinner one night and the place has all the basic appliances, cutlery, etc that worked out nicely. It was also surprisingly quiet on the street side as I was nervous the roaming of the cars would keep me up all night. I imagine there are a few airbnb units in that building so once in a while you do hear loud and inconsiderate guests yelling in the corridors.   But it's not that often.  If there was one thing I could change is the size of the bed as I'm used to larger beds but that is just me being picky. :)"},{"_id":"325063109","date":{"$date":"2018-09-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"22336599","reviewer_id":"88022348","reviewer_name":"Marie","comments":"Localisation parfaite."},{"_id":"325723536","date":{"$date":"2018-09-20T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"22336599","reviewer_id":"13143495","reviewer_name":"Peter","comments":"This is a lovely apartment in a fantastic location next to the cathedral, a short walk from many of the sights of Montreal."},{"_id":"327274626","date":{"$date":"2018-09-23T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"22336599","reviewer_id":"18416495","reviewer_name":"Claudine","comments":"Loved our stay at this loft!

Very easy to find and get into. It seems like most of the building, if not all, are AirBnB units and that the host owns a few of them. I didn't have any problems with the building or room key pass. The walls are very thin and I could hear the neighbors doing things like using the washroom and opening/closing the blinds but thankfully that's the only noise we had to deal with and it wasn't a big deal.\n\nThe air mattress was easy to set up (it has a built in pump) and there were plenty of linens to make the bed with. The bed and the air mattress were comfortable. The duvets are thin but warm. The air mattress was easy to deflate and put away.\n\nThe shower has really good flow and the water is nice and warm. The handheld unit leaks a bit of water even when it's not activated so be careful that you have it pointed well away from the shower door or else it will leak onto the floor as a few inches of the door seal is ripped/missing.\n\nI didn't use the kitchen at all so I can't comment on it. The only thing I did notice though is that there is no microwave, but there is one of those small toaster oven and an actual oven if you need it.\n\nWe had an issue the first night with the heat and had a cold night and morning. There was a lot of back and forth with the host as they weren't understanding me when I was telling them that the thermostat would not let me set it higher than 20, but they solved the problem by the next night (they provided me with details on how to reset the thermostat so now it can be set higher than 20) so hopefully it won't be a problem going forward for anyone else.\n\nOverall a decent stay. It's a bare bones place but it's worth it for the location. If you're there for at least a few days pick up some extra toilet paper as they don't leave you a lot and bring some shopping bags so you can change the bathroom garbage."},{"_id":"335587809","date":{"$date":"2018-10-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"22336599","reviewer_id":"10501867","reviewer_name":"Kim","comments":"Great location for nice restaurants and too see the sights of old port Montreal.

Wir informierten sie also, dass wir noch das dritte Bettzeug bräuchten. Sie hat dann ganz schnell jemanden organisiert der uns das dritte Bettzeug und ein drittes Handtuch beschaffen hat. \n\nDie Kommunikation mit Wendy verlief super schnell und sehr gut. Sie hat sich ganz schnell bemüht uns entgegen zu kommen und uns noch einen Rabatt gegeben für die Unannehmlichkeit. Das fand ich super! \n\nDas Apartment war ansonsten mit allem ausgestattet was man braucht und das Bad ist sehr schön! \n\nUnser Check-in lief reibungslos und schnell. Für ein paar Nächte kann man hier gut unterkommen. Verschiedene Busse fahren die Straße runter und ein Schwimmbad sowie ein Fitnessraum bietet die Unterkunft auch. \n\nIch würde die Unterkunft weiterempfehlen allerdings nur zu zweit. Das dritte Bett bzw. Sofa nicht ganz so komfortabel ist.

Breakfast at Grandmas 5 minutes down the road was excellent.  The Cannery is also within walking distance where you can get a bite to eat or coffee.  \nI found the bed too hard but that may be personal preference whereas my husband likes hard beds.\nWe were unable to get the TV to work at all as there two remotes to the TV set up and looked everywhere for instructions but there wasn't any.  Eventually I called Wendy for instructions which we followed and still nothing so contacted her again, same thing, so I contacted her again and eventually she said she would send someone the next day as she thought it was too late but we said it was okay and someone came within 25 minutes.  Wendy's communication was good however she should have known about the new TV set up.  The only access to the TV was through UTube.   We were disappointed with the lack of utensils.  There was a wok to cook in and no saucepans or frypan. There no salad servers or spatula, basically just basic.  I looked in the drawers for clean tea towels and found two small cloth placemats which I used as a tea towel.  There were no sponges or dishwasher tablets.  I did find a used tea towel in the laundry but did not want to use it.  The only thing in the apartment was some tea bags which I am sure was left by the previous tenants. Every Airbnb we have stayed at has been great and provided basic cooking provisions such as oil, salt and pepper, coffee, tea, condiments etc and some hosts have been very generous and left fresh bread, fruit and other lovely delights. Not that we expect that this is what every host should provide but the basics I think is not asking too much Every Airbnb we have stayed at has provided either a Nespresso machine/ plunger or both. 2 bath towels and hand towels were provided but there was no bath mat.  It would have been nice to be provided with pool towels as we did use the pool and luckily it was hot enough on the balcony for the bath towels to dry.  Be prepared for loud bangs as tenants in the building would often let their doors bang.  It is a lovely apartment and I would stay again provided essentials etc as mentioned above were provided."},{"_id":"245338014","date":{"$date":"2018-03-21T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"22337456","reviewer_id":"54420815","reviewer_name":"Maimai","comments":"Wendy’s place is very nice.

Located not so far from the airport which only 10 min ride by taxi from airport. The train station were around 15 min walk but there were several bus stop that can connect you with the city. Since we are the first timer to Sydney, we are not so sure using the bus to the city. We just use the bus to get to Bondi Junction. The rest we are using train. There are quite complete cooking ware provided in the apt, so we are able to cook simple breakfast. We have lovely stay in Wendy’s apartment despite of the faucet on the kitchen sink issue that we have on our last day in Sydney which it was pop out suddenly when we use it, seems the faucet connection were not that strong so the water pressure make it pop out. Hopefully, Wendy’s husband can fix it easily. \nThe communication with Wendy is also quite fast. She responded timely, no issue at all. Even her husband came on 9 pm to explain us how to use the TV. Thanks a bunch Wendy for letting us stay in ur apt and letting us leave our luggage in ur apt until 2 pm in our last day. We have great stay!

The apartment was clean, modern, and comfortable.  With two of us staying there, there was a double bed in the bedroom and a couch that turned into a double bed in the living room. Thus, we had plenty of space. Having air conditioning in the apartment was a real joy during a hot December. Wendy was really diligent about communicating with us. Overall, we were very happy about our stay in Wendy's apartment. The kitchen was equipped with a stove/oven and microwave. The one recommendation that we would make — based on the fact that we were there for nine nights — would be to have a full set of cooking pots and pans.

Communication with Howard was easy \u0026 quick. He made sure to provide us with information early and often! Having AC was very nice, but the breeze from the ocean kept us cool most of the time. I would recommend having a car to get around, since places to eat are limited in Maalaea; we found ourselves going into Kihei (15-20 min drive) for dinner.

We never once had to contact the host during our stay, as everything was well explained before our trip and there was detailed instructions for everything left in the condo. Amenities in the unit (including the a/c, coffee maker, TV) worked great, the beds were comfortable, and we had a great sleep every night.\r\n\r\nThe photos of the condo grounds do not do it justice! The views from the Lanai are breathtaking, and the upkeep of the grounds are truly perfection. It does get windy in this area, but it's better than the light rain that the Northern part gets, and I would welcome the wind during the hot summer months. \r\n\r\nOur itinerary was full of activities (less beach-only activities), and the central location was perfect to travel to all our excursions (Lahaina, Road to Hana, Halaekala, etc). After long days of excursions, the central location and short ride home was so beneficial for us. For our beach days, it was only 10 min to get to the nice sandy beaches in Kihei.  My parents have a very particular palate, so we cooked a lot at home and put the large BBQ on the condo grounds and the rice cooker provided to good use. The unit had all the essentials we needed, and grocery stores were close by (Tip for (Website hidden by Airbnb) NOT go to the Korean grocery first. Go to Foodland first as their asian products, including rice and instant ramen, are a LOT cheaper). \r\n\r\nWe had a great time, and our stay at Howard and Kathleen's condo really helped make our stay enjoyable. \r\n"},{"_id":"121763927","date":{"$date":"2016-12-18T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2236449","reviewer_id":"5852686","reviewer_name":"Vanessa","comments":"We had a FANTASTIC time at Howard's place! The location is great, not too touristy, but very convenient. The balcony and bedroom overlook the ocean, and we could hear the waves all night with the window open.

He gave restaurant recommendations, activities, directions, and even laminated info cards on the island. \r\nI highly recommend using Pacific Whale Foundation for all of your snorkeling and whale watching activities. They provide a great experience, and are around the corner (5 mins walking) from Howard's place.\r\nHe is a very forthcoming host, and not only was the communication above and beyond, accessing the place was really easy too. \r\nMy group of 4 adults (2 couples) really enjoyed our stay, and Howard is one of the best hosts I've ever had the pleasure of dealing with on AirBNB.

We are so happy with our decision to stay at his condo versus a hotel.  Cleanliness was of utmost important to us and the condo exceeded our expectations!  Nothing was old, dingy, or smelly. Everything was clean, beautiful, and tactfully decorated.  You can tell that Howard has gone the extra-mile to make his guests feel at home.  The kitchen is well equipped with Cuisinart pots/pans, appliances, indoor and outdoor dishware/glassware etc.  The beds, linens, and towels were all very clean and comfortable.  He has laminated directions/maps to places of interest, restaurants, etc. which makes it easy when exploring Maui.  He also provides beach chairs, umbrellas, cooler, sand toys, snorkeling gear, pool toys, etc. so no need to worry about those things.  Communication with Howard was easy.  He was prompt with his replies and provided detailed information to all our questions. The condo is centrally located so it’s a 20-30 minute drive to most destinations, including the airport and Costco. There is a designated parking spot so there’s no need to hunt around for parking. It is a bit tight though, but a mid-size four door car will fit fine. The condo itself is located on a beautiful and peaceful property that was well-maintained and clean.  We started our day with breakfast on the lanai every morning.  In the evening, we enjoyed lounging on the lawn chairs while watching the waves and sea turtles.  At night, the stars are plentiful. There is also a heated pool that the kids loved.  It was never crowded. We sincerely enjoyed our stay here and if we’re lucky enough to visit again, we will definitely rent from Howard again.

A few downsides: The kitchen was fairly well supplied but the location of items was somewhat disorganized for real cooking and serving and some of the equipment wasn’t found as clean as I’d like (I’m pretty fussy). The condo decor is attractive but included some big decorative bowls and urns that were in the way and a breakage worry. We were four adults and the condo was a comfortable space for us except for eating together,  which was a bit tight - the inside tabletop is small).

The issue was just due to the Festival of Sao Joao sothe whole town had poor WiFi. Otherwise the WiFi was great for the rest of the trip! Beautiful place to explore the city as you could walk everywhere from the location!"},{"_id":"326475010","date":{"$date":"2018-09-22T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"22374646","reviewer_id":"6196129","reviewer_name":"Kara","comments":"This apartment was wonderful for our three days in Porto.

The bathroom and living room was smaller than expected. Worse of all, there was no drawers or tables in the bedroom forcing us to put our things on the floor. In the morning, we couldn't sleep as there were no blinds closing the window, only a sheer cloth. When we tried to cook, the dishes and pans were unwashed.

Easy walk to the subway, good food, Brooklyn Museum, and Prospect Park. It was comfortable and convenient. I was totally fine with the 4th floor walk up, but make sure that you are really comfortable bringing your suitcase up and down all those stairs. Folks in the building were friendly. \n\nWhen I had a little Internet problem, Rosalynn responded quickly. There were a few things in the home I couldn't figure out (how to turn on the living room ceiling fan and how to keep the bedroom fan on without lights), but they weren't a big deal and I'm sure Rosalynn would have responded quickly if I had asked her about it. The A/C worked great, especially considering the August heat and humidity. \n\nOne thing to note is that it appears that the host lives there, and just stays elsewhere when it gets rented. I like that because it means I'm helping someone with their rent rather than renting an airbnb-only space which takes away valuable housing in a gentrifying community. The only downside is that there isn't much space for your own things. Probably not a big deal for short stays, but possibly an inconvenience for longer visits. There wasn't space for me to unpack my suitcase and the fridge/freezer are half filled.  I also felt nervous touching/disturbing any of her things  (the host didn't give me any indication that she cared, it was my own hang up). I guess I'm just trying to say that it was a good reminder that I'm renting someone's apartment, not a hotel room.\n\nI enjoyed it overall and would totally consider coming back next time I'm in town."},{"_id":"325057843","date":{"$date":"2018-09-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"223930","reviewer_id":"151113482","reviewer_name":"Hajnalka","comments":"Rosalynn lakása tökéletes helyen van, 4-5 percre a Brooklyni múzeumtól, parktól, metrómegállótól, mégis nagyon csöndes és biztonságos helyen.

It was clean and as described.  Some things were annoying but we slept well and loved the accessibility.  \n\nSally's place has a GREAT location for public transit. Legit \u003c10 min walk (kid-pace) to the central train station, once we figured out the fastest route.  We used the trains and buses and also walked to many central destinations.  Perfect for our needs.  \n\nDon't be put off by the odd configuration.  The lounge room with beds is spacious and comfortable.  We used it both for kids' bedroom and eating.  Didn't spend a lot of time in the apartment otherwise so that was just fine.  The only issue was eating over carpet; we had to vacuum to manage crumbs between meals.  \n\nThe biggest drawback here was in the bathroom.  The toilet is LOUD when it's refilling--kind of a squealing sound as if the shower is on.  Made us not want to flush after anyone went to bed.  And speaking of the shower, it was one of the worst I've encountered!!  Low pressure and the temperature would change randomly from cold to scalding hot (and NOT while anything else was using water in the apartment.) My family was amused by my yelps as I got hit by hotter water than I could stand, but I wasn't!  A bath was more pleasant, and perfect for the kids, but be aware that the tub is an odd shape.  It narrows at the upper end and anyone larger than my US-size-10 bottom can expect not to be able to sit in it for a soak.  \n\nKitchen is clean and minimally-adequately-equipped.  There are just enough pots \u0026 pans to do some basic cooking, but only one huge awkward knife.  I've suggested they get a better set!  There was a dishwasher but not much detergent so we mostly washed by hand.  I wish there had been a teapot--I made tea in a saucepan.  You'll find some very basic supplies (salt/pepper/sugar/tea) but otherwise pretty much bare cupboards--this isn't one of those places where you'll find some edibles left from previous guests.   That's fine; some people really prefer it that way.  Just be aware you'll need to supply most all condiments, oils etc.  if you plan to cook.  \n\nWe liked having the clothes washer and some detergent was provided.  \n\nThe shades are good in the bedroom but in the lounge/bedroom there's a slight bay window that can't be darkened as fully.  Thankfully the kids were jet-lagged enough to sleep well anyway.  \n\nOne thing that gave me a weird feeling were all sorts of ominous signs and letters to residents posted in the lobby and elevators--it sounds like the building is recently under new management and getting its financial affairs in order?  Also lots of rules about visitors and not letting people in or loaning out your key, which made me wonder if they've had problems with objectionable people?  We didn't encounter anything untoward, but it doesn't create a great atmosphere."},{"_id":"353191559","date":{"$date":"2018-11-26T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"22509800","reviewer_id":"143270401","reviewer_name":"Agus","comments":"A very strategic location in the middle of two train stations.\nOne of the places that provide an exact address and place.

Go there early to get the affordable breakfast set.\nNearest proper supermarket is Coles in World Square, less than 1 km.\nThe Chinatown and Paddy's market are in the walking distance.\nIn short, if you are agree with the prices, you are better directly book this property."},{"_id":"355391478","date":{"$date":"2018-12-03T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"22509800","reviewer_id":"43749421","reviewer_name":"Simone","comments":"Well valued, clean and tidy."},{"_id":"365007587","date":{"$date":"2018-12-31T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"22509800","reviewer_id":"172286265","reviewer_name":"Marcell","comments":"Awesome location  walking distance to everything you need in Sydney."},{"_id":"400679290","date":{"$date":"2019-01-12T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"22509800","reviewer_id":"51112065","reviewer_name":"Kath","comments":"amazing location. very clean and secure. \ncommunication fantastic and easy check in and checkout. \ndefinitely on my list each time I go to Sydney  thanks Sally."},{"_id":"411561136","date":{"$date":"2019-02-12T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"22509800","reviewer_id":"231207781","reviewer_name":"장심","comments":"Sally's house is in a perfect location."},{"_id":"412957296","date":{"$date":"2019-02-16T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"22509800","reviewer_id":"111521020","reviewer_name":"Ji","comments":"Great locaction , nice host."}]}

We spent a great deal of time out on the patio watching the sea turtles. You cannot beat this view!  We loved every minute of our vacation. The snorkeling just west of the building is great- we swam with the turtles! There's a nice sandy area to just hang out, too. The owner is super responsive to messages and very accommodating.  She provided many tourist tips and there's a Kauai book in the condo that we used for hours each day while exploring the island.  Condo is very clean and has everything you need, including beach chairs, an umbrella, beach towels, and boogie boards.  This has been my all-time favorite vacation!

We liked the location and the view very much. The price wasn't too high. The experience was okay but not the best experience I've had with Airbnb places. Some complications occurred, and the host expected my collaboration in solving the problem. The internet didn't work for the first three days, and it took the host some time to accept that there was a problem and solve it. The host was friendly and apologized when I expressed my dissatisfaction with something but not as respectful as what I expected. For example,  when I went to pick up the keys, he was still busy cleaning the bathroom and doing the laundry, and he jokingly asked me to help him with preparing the house."}]}

He was friendly, a great communicator and everything was as listed. It's a very generously proportioned apartment for New York, therefore great value for money if you're looking for something a little different from the typical foursquare room with kitchen bar etc. It is a home so it comes with years of love and life, and testament to that is the incredibly well stocked kitchen - everything you could ever need to (Website hidden by Airbnb) end of utensils and so on. A great space to unwind and spread out; two people will not feel cramped. I would be lying if I said it was not unquiet outside the window; the passing traffic is busy during the day and drivers are energetic with their car horns - but this is New York, that's why we visit! If you fancy diving right into New York life and live like a real New Yorker for a few weeks we highly recommend Sal and his apartment to give you that opportunity. The location couldn't be better - the A,C,E train entrance is tripping distance from the front door, blink and you'll slip down into it- Canal Street's other stops are all 2 mins walk away. To the south of Canal Street is Tribeca, and Sal's place is like the gateway to Tribeca. Please tourists, don't bother with Times Square...just avoid it like the plague - hang out and eat down here and get the fast train up to the park. Highly recommend Everyman Espresso round the corner from Sal's; within minutes of downing one of their excellent espressos you are in Soho, or Chinatown or on the waterfront or in the shadow of Wall Street. Yep, it's a great place to wake up in and see what we think is the proper New York. And Sal is very personable and eager to help with any issues that may arise."}]}

The location is perfect - very convenient to the 23rd Street subway station which will take you pretty much anywhere you need to go in Manhattan. The studio is at street level on a surprisingly quiet street (at least at night) which makes getting in/out much easier than a place with an elevator or tons of stairs. The studio is small (hence the name), but doesn't fall short on the essentials - spacious bathroom with a HUGE shower and a smart kitchen in case you want to dine in (several grocery stores are nearby). The sofa bed was nice and firm which felt great after a long day. We didn't manage to turn on the TV, but it seemed as though it would have everything you want if you're into that. Overall one of the best airbnb properties we've stayed in - clean, convenient, and a modernized interior with all the big city charm you could wish for. We will definitely stay again when we come back and highly recommend Isabelle's studio to friends and family visiting the \"big apple\"!"},{"_id":"31141273","date":{"$date":"2015-05-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2255549","reviewer_id":"31798532","reviewer_name":"Ian","comments":"Good location for Chelsea, Meatpacking areas and downtown Manhattan as a whole.

It was a nice, small studio on the first floor. The neighborhood was a nice change in pace from the normal NYC, but only a short walk away from the craziness of Times Square, Rockefeller Center, etc., if you want to experience that. Overall, a great alternative to an expensive hotel.\r\n\r\nThe bed (couch) was not too bad, but if you are a light sleeper you might want to bring an extra pillow and some ear plugs. Like most places in NYC (hotels included!) there was a lot of street noise throughout the night. We also had one incident that I can only assume doesn't happen often. At about 1:30AM we had the buzzer for our unit rang by a young woman who had clearly been out having a good time. No big deal, it's NYC so you should have a good time, but after her friend (don't know who she was there to see, I assume there are several units above the first floor but I have no clue) came down to get her and let her in the building, she started opening our door! I wasn't concerned for safety seeing as I could see her on the screen and she was obviously just a drunk girl acting drunk and opening what she thought to be her door, but the concerning thing was that it seemed like her key worked for our door before her friend grabbed her and stopped her. I don't know if there are multiple units, and I am only speculating since the door never opened all the way, but either way it was a frustrating experience to have to deal with at 1:30 in the morning.\r\n\r\nBack to the unit itself, the bathroom was nice and having a fridge is a nice benefit when in the city. The only real complaint that we had was cleanliness. We would have liked the unit to be a bit cleaner as we did find some hairs in the sheets they provided, but we were an early check-in so they may not have had the normal time to clean. The TV also didn't work while we were there, but you shouldn't be inside watching TV in NYC anyways.\r\n\r\nIsabelle was really a great host and allowed to to experience the city in a new way. I recommend staying here if you want to experience a different slice of NYC life."},{"_id":"56238586","date":{"$date":"2015-12-11T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2255549","reviewer_id":"30383863","reviewer_name":"Jeff","comments":"One of the best hosts I have ever had.

It was indeed very clean, great water pressure in bath sink and shower, great hot water, but not in early morning (see below).  Didn't use the kitchen so can't comment on that.  Nice foyer entry, easy key access.  Host easily accessible, very nice and responds quickly.\r\n\r\nCons:  Not a lot of storage/closet space and only about 6 hangers, but it wasn't an issue for me, just an observation.  If you use a washcloth for showering you need to bring your own, there are hand towels and bath towels but no wash cloths.  I mention it as I've never run across that situation in all my years of travel....and I use a washcloth.  There was an issue with the bed sheets which owner tried to resolve but replacement sheets didn't fit so I just did the best I could.  Bed may at one time have been really nice, but it's starting to go past it's shelf life.  If it's just one person and you sleep on the outside section of the mattress you'll be fine but the bend in the mattress (from being folded into sofa position) is permanent at this point and the mattress sags into the crease which is not comfortable to sleep in.  During weekdays at around 8:00 am there is absolutely NO hot water, an hour later there is, and perhaps even earlier, but if you get up at that particular time  you might as well forget it being even lukewarm.  My biggest disappointment was the TV.  It does indeed say it's a smart TV in the listing and it's my fault for not noticing that, but...I really wanted to come back after working and watch the evening news or a fav program or two, but all you can do is a search on past news programs and watch clips....and it took waaay too much time to look around thro the available apps.  I really missed just being able to turn on the tv and watch that evenings programming.  \r\n\r\nI really wasn't as comfortable as I would have liked and so probably won't be back, but there are some very nice things about the place and everyone's experience and expectations are different....the things that I had an issue with might not bother someone else.\r\n"},{"_id":"116784232","date":{"$date":"2016-12-03T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2255549","reviewer_id":"95122866","reviewer_name":"Wendy","comments":"As first timers we were a little apprehensive but we needn't have worried.

The space exceeded our expectations as it was comfortable, extremely clean and had all amenities provided. \n\nIn the main living space, the pull-out sofa was comfortable and easy to assemble. The coffee table has wheels so it is easily mobile. We really appreciated the coasters provided to keep the table clean throughout our stay. The television has many interesting shows provided.  \n\nIn the bathroom space there were many towels provided and good quality toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, body wash, toilet paper, tissue paper). \n\nIn the kitchen space the fridge was a fair size to store food and drinks. Charles provides basic kitchen tools and tea/coffee supplies. \n\nThe most striking aspect of this place is the location. My girlfriend and I fell in love with the Chelsea area. The area is safe, the food spots are unique (especially when exploring the Chelsea Market nearby), and the neighbourhood architecture is stunning. \n\nWe used the subway system heavily with the F, M and 1 trains being two blocks down - connecting us to all major attractions. \n\nThe only critique of Charles's place is that depending on the day, it can get a bit noisy outside with sirens and pedestrians. However, we took this as part of the New York experience. \n\nOverall, we would most definitely stay at Charles's place again. Staying in the neighbourhood itself made us feel like we were integrated into the New York culture and community."},{"_id":"264727619","date":{"$date":"2018-05-14T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2255549","reviewer_id":"53201298","reviewer_name":"Shannon","comments":"This place is awesome!

The location is terrific....only steps away from several good coffee shops, restaurants and Whole Foods only a 2 blocks away. The studio is small but was perfect for my husband and me. I feel it would be tight for 3 adults. When comparing the rate to that of hotels -which would be as small or smaller I felt the rate was a good value -especially considering the location. We called Charles when we checked in to ask a question and he answered right away and so we were impressed by his attentiveness. I should note that on the Fri night of our visit we woke up to some late night conversation on the sidewalk (the apartment is on the first floor) but we turned on our phone's noise screen app and never was disturbed again so it really was not an issue.

Clean, well maintained, and in the kitchen there were all the appliances you would need to cook. Omar's studio was close to major avenues and the metro station as well.The location alone was exactly what I was looking for. There was so many restaurants, coffee shops, boutiques and pubs nearby. There is also a grocery store close to pick up a few things if you wish. All the top attractions are walking distance as well. This area is very safe. In all, my stay was wonderful!

Thank you for your interest in one of our vacation rentals.  We are a TEAM of professionals who manage individually owned condo apartments for the owners when they aren't using them within several different condo / hotel buildings in Waikiki.   We offer a range of accommodations types from small studio apartments (with or without kitchenettes) to 2 bedroom residences with full kitchens.  \r\n\r\nWe want your stay to be an enjoyable one and finding the right match for you is key.  As a general guideline, there are many different types of buildings and hotel-type of arrangements.  For those doing Hawaii on a budget, studios offer the best of both worlds providing a clean, private place to stay within walking distance to the BEACH at affordable prices (vary for upgrades, views, cooking abilities).   For those looking for nicer or larger accommodations, then you should target $150/night off season to $250/night peak season (vary for upgrades, views, cooking abilities, building amenities, parking included).  If you are looking for an Ocean-front experience, then target $350- $400/night and for a luxury experience, $500 to over $1000/night.  Hawaii offers something for everyone at every price point!  \r\n\r\nOur vacation rental units are privately owned and managed.  We offer an alternative to the hotel experience allowing our guests to “live like a local” in paradise whether be for a few days, a few weeks or a few months.  Our units are well maintained, repaired when necessary and treated routinely with pest control services.  We try not to interrupt our guests during their stay, and if the unexpected happens, we do our best to resolve it quickly with the least inconvenience to our guests.   Upon arrival, we try to meet all our guests personally to register, check-in, and answer any questions.  And if you’re running late don’t worry, we can make arrangements no matter the hour and register you in the office the next day.  \r\n\r\nStop by our real estate office, ground floor of Kuhio Village.  We are there daily to assist and share this incredibly beautiful island, local eateries, activities and entertainment found in Waikiki and around the island.  We look forward to hosting you in one of our vacation rental units and helping to make your stay a fantastic one.

We totally enjoyed our stay. Though the boys can share the double bed in the second bedroom, but one of them had the option to sleep on the sofa bed in the living room, so everyone was very comfortable.  We really appreciate the  cleanness,  comfortable beds and central location of their guest house, only a short drive to Downtown Hilo.  Jon and Noe are very friendly and welcoming, quick communication by emails.  \nThe covered car port in front of guest suite is a brilliant idea and much appreciated since the first night we came in, it was pouring rain.  (And probably you all know, Hilo tends to rain quite a bit). The carport kept us totally dry while we unloaded our luggage, and it also kept our car cooler, out of the sun.\nThank you Jon \u0026 Noe for our pleasant stay at your guest house."},{"_id":"298841263","date":{"$date":"2018-07-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"22622636","reviewer_id":"63761253","reviewer_name":"Stephanie","comments":"Great hosts!

Each bedroom had very comfortable beds and its own private bathroom with shower, sink and toilet. Like the fact that the bedrooms are in opposite sides so there is a feeling of privacy.

Would like some improvement on the front toilet door ( doesn't close well) , sofa (stained /looked dirty), floor pillows (bleached out/looked dirty \u0026 worn out), dust balls on the floor, toiletries (handsoap and more shampoo/shower gel), trashbins (in toilets were too small). With regards to logistics, 3 blocks walk to get to bus or metro at Placa Catalunya. Hereon, everything is within reach- tourist sites, transportation, shops, food, etc. We arrived during a taxi strike so the 4 of us were forced to take the Aeroport bus with 4 big luggages and 4 stroller bags. Angel suggested the Airport bus and it got us there easy and fast. Only difficulty was lugging all our luggages to the door.

The building is quiet during the day but we caution that the nightlifers and early morning refuse collection/commuting traffic will provide a background track to your sleep. The triple pane window/shutter combo certainly helps, paired with a pair of ear plugs and you'll be set-up for a cozy sleep. The beds were super comfy and everything very tidy and clean.

You can literally walk anywhere. We loved the location. The heater worked great for warm up the room and the beds were very comfortable. It even had a full kitchen \n\nBut for two days we had hours of drilling and hammering which was heard throughout the apartment. We would wake up to it in the mornings and when we wanted to come back to the afternoon to rest, we couldn't do so. \n\nIt would have been nice if Angel told us about the construction ahead of time. I have an elderly father who needs his rest in between sightseeing and he was not able to. If we would have known, we would have never stayed here. Angel should have told us once he knew about the construction. When I messaged him about it, he said he knew nothing about it and was going to ask the neighbor. I spoke to a neighbor and the construction has been going on for quite some time. He never responded to me after that. He just ignored me, did not even apologize \n\nFrom the little things such as no soap in the dispenser, and lack of hot water, to the major construction, we felt neglected, which is not the normal air bnb experience. I have stayed in dozens of places and it was a bummer when we had this beautiful apartment but couldn't enjoy it. \n\nI rarely right negative reviews, like ever!

Una camera ha due materassi singoli che si possono unire facilmente, l’altra invece un letto matrimoniale e bagno in camera, il divano letto in soggiorno, invece, quando aperto diventa un letto matrimoniale.\nI bagni sono molto moderni tuttavia al momento non hanno una chiusura interna, questo potrebbe essere un problema se si soggiorna fra amici. Uno dei due dispone di una piccola finestra, l’altro invece di un aspiratore d’aria.\nLa cucina presentava il piano cottura ad induzione lesionato ma funzionante. Fornita di lavastoviglie, microonde, forno, lavatrice e altri strumenti nonché di stoviglie e kit di pulizia.\nLa temperatura interna è gradevole, l’appartamento dispone di climatizzazione centralizzata tuttavia gli infissi sono molto vecchi e lasciano passare un po’ d’aria.\nIl palazzo è molto antico ma è tenuto in maniera decente, l’appartamento si trova al quinto piano ma la struttura è munita di ascensore (fuori servizio per un giorno durante la nostra permanenza). \nL’appartamento è soleggiato, ha due piccoli balconi ai quali è possibile accedere dalla zona soggiorno e da una delle camere, l’altra camera invece ha una piccola finestra.\nL’appartamento è sufficientemente pulito.\n\nPosizione:\nOttima! A circa 10 minuti a piedi dalla Rambla e da Plaça de Catalunya. Circa 5 minuti a piedi dalla fermata Universitat della metro e solo 2 minuti dalla fermata dell’autobus. In zona ci sono alcuni market tra cui Carrefour Express a circa 100 metri e la via in cui si trova offre alcuni cafè, birrerie e piccoli ristoranti aperti fino a mezzanotte. Il sabato sera la via è affollata di ragazzi e i locali chiudono un po’ più tardi. L’entrata del palazzo si trova accanto ad un parcheggio che potrebbe essere molto comodo nel caso in cui si decide di noleggiare un’auto (anche se noi non lo abbiamo fatto, i mezzi pubblici funzionano molto bene), consiglio il carnet di biglietti T10 (10 biglietti per bus e metro al costo di 10,20€ acquistabile nelle stazioni metro) piuttosto che acquistare i biglietti direttamente sul bus in quanto questi costano 2,20€. \n\nA mio avviso la casa è perfetta per due coppie di adulti oppure per una famiglia fino a sei persone. \nConsiglio vivamente questo appartamento."},{"_id":"260013850","date":{"$date":"2018-05-03T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2265321","reviewer_id":"132226409","reviewer_name":"Denis","comments":"L'appartamento e' grande, ben arredato e fornito, sito al piano alto (con ascensore) di una casa d'epoca.

We basically walked everywhere every day that we hardly needed to use the metro. Space wise, it was larger than the pictures showed - having two bathrooms was a huge bonus! We loved the view from the balcony as well, beautiful Spanish balconies opposite you, and on clear days you could see Tibidabo on the left. Check in was a breeze, Angel couldn’t make it but he made sure to get a friend’s help to meet us and show us around. The feedback we would suggest is to look into giving guests an extra set of towel if they are staying long, as well as cleaning the floor more thoroughly. It felt a little sandy/gritty to us when we arrived. Perhaps it was the nature of the tiles, or our habit of taking shoes off in homes (Angel’s friend mentioned we can just leave our shoes on) - or both - but in any case, we easily found some cleaning supplies on the balcony to mop the floor, and all was good after."},{"_id":"269244900","date":{"$date":"2018-05-27T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2265321","reviewer_id":"6452650","reviewer_name":"Don","comments":"Angel's place was great!

It's very stylish with original floors, it's almost on the top level of the building so you get a nice view of the street and trees below you.  If you have heavy or awkward suitcases, there is a small elevator.  Once we had ours in the apartment we just used the stairs.  The place is not big but works very well.  The two bedrooms are on opposite sides of the apartment so you have a bit of privacy.  The mattresses are very comfortable too, which is great as often when we rent through airbnb they are old and sink in the middle.  It is centrally located, close to the metro line.  There are also lots of good shops nearby too.  There are plenty of bakeries/cafes just around the block if you want to grab something for breakfast.  Angel also left some recommendations on restaurants and things to do.  He highly recommended La Flauta for dinner, we tried to go twice (1st night the line up was too long, second night was closed due to public holiday) and we finally succeeded on the 3rd night.  You must eat there.  The tapas were the best we had in Spain all for a reasonable place.  Get there early or be prepared to wait.  On the recommendations sheet, he warned us that the Gothic area has lots of pick pockets spots to be careful.  We ended up going and witnessed someone getting pick pocketed.  \nWe would highly recommend Angel's place."},{"_id":"338009496","date":{"$date":"2018-10-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2265321","reviewer_id":"32693568","reviewer_name":"Christina Bruun","comments":"We highly recommend the apartment.

The location was excellent and close to bars, restaurants,  mini supermarkets, city centre and metro stop just around the corner (L1\u0026L3). The stairs and lift were well lit at night. Another bonus was we had 2 sets of keys. Only slight negatives were the WiFi  not being very good, the pillows could have done with being replaced and it was s but noisy in the front bedroom due to road adjacent to our street.

It’s located about 15-20 minutes from the Kona airport as well as the local downtown area. Ocean views! The unit is brand new with very nice furniture and stylish decor. Beautiful lanai. Great barbecue and wonderful hosts. Full kitchen that’s great if you want to make your own meals. Loved having a separate living room and bedroom. There is a tv in both rooms. One thing I would suggest is having ear plugs because the rooster is up every morning. That’s pretty common all over Hawaii and other islands, so nothing on the guests. It didn’t bother me at all because I had ear plugs and my boyfriend didn’t have any but he still slept through it. My boyfriend and I loved our stay here. So grateful for the basket of tasty goodies, the books, board games, toiletries, and more. We would definitely stay here again!"},{"_id":"234451602","date":{"$date":"2018-02-12T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"22706114","reviewer_id":"26335182","reviewer_name":"Carol","comments":"The space was much larger than anticipated.

Abby was very welcoming and easy to communicate with. \n\nYou will definitely want a car here. We weren't able to get a rental car until day 2 of our vacation.

Perfect in every way. location is 10 minutes drive to downtown, shopping, beaches, airport,  costco, walmart, target and anything else you can think of.  Abby has a beautiful dog name Honey.

There is a gas grill in lanai, bunch of board games, boogie boards and beach chairs. If any supplies are short, just message Abby, she will quietly come down from upstairs and leave new ones in front of your door step. I always thought renting guesthouses sitting near from their owner is not a good idea, but Abby's place changed my point of view. The place is perfectly balanced with privacy, convenience and safety. The best of this place is its size! It's huge and you will really appreciate it.

It had plenty of room for our family of 5. It's right across the street from the Metro station, which was fantastic. There are no laundry facilities, but we didn't need them, so that was fine with us! We had a couple of questions while we were there and she answered almost immediately! The only downside was temporary and not at all Jade's fault. They are doing construction right next door and they start every morning promptly at 7, so if sleeping in is a priority, it might not work out for a little while.

There are a number of bookshops (which I love) and many furniture and clothes stores.

Arnie was interststae for most of my stay so I didn't get much time to chat with him but I enjoyed chatting to the other guests in the evening.  They loved the house and were very interested in its history.\r\nThe lack of street parking was the only negative.  There is a small parking area leading to the house, but my parking skills were obviously lacking and I incurred a $1400 damage bill from the car rental firm due to scrapes on the vehicle.

Very easy to get to many great neighborhoods in Sydney from his location.\r\n\r\nMy only complaints were having a shared bathroom, and that the room was right next to Arnie's own bedroom.  The close proximity didn't cause any issues really, we just had to be extra quiet to not disturb them.  There is another bedroom on the other side of the house which would have provided better privacy, but that was occupied during our stay.

We stayed in one of the double bedrooms which was very comfortable for just two nights. I think this would be a great option for renting the whole property but if you're just staying in one room it does feel a little like you're disturbing the family. Also a little odd that their daughter sleeps in a corridor outside the guest room. We found that rather uncomfortable, even if they put a door or a curtain across the corridor to block it off would have been better. There's also no mention of the fact they have a kid on their profile.

The surrounding area is teaming with cafes - The Bonython is literally next door - The Alimentari down the road and tonnes of great restaurants - a few minutes to Oxford St via William St - minutes form regular buses and taxis. Paddington is a great area of Sydney. Historically, culinary and fashion wise with a market on Saturday. Believe me - a fine way to experience Sydney as a visitor.

There's two Airbnb rooms who share the beautiful stone bathroom but I rarely noticed the other guests, the room I had isn't pictured but had a great feel with gorgeous natural light and plenty of space.

When I first walked into the house to drop off my luggage, Arnie opened the doors and quickly walked away making me feel like an inconvenience.\r\nThe room that was given unfortunately looked nothing like the room that was in the photos. The house felt very cold, dark, and lifeless. The house also probably needed a proper clean, it smelt very dusty. The bathroom doors despite no opened windows would occasionally just open itself which was annoying when you're in the shower or on the toilet. I used the scales on the ground that I found and leaned them on the door so that my time in the bathroom wasn't interrupted. \r\nThe wifi also did not connect if you were upstairs, which meant you were not able to use the internet in your own room. The pool could've used a clean, looked like nobody had swam in there for a few years. Lorraine also made a point that we weren't allowed to walk up the stairs in our shoes which is fair enough, however the manner in which she did it was like a parent lecturing a child which I thought was unnecessary. \r\n\r\nA highlight of our stay was Arnie's daughter Arabella, she was very well-mannered and welcoming. \r\n"},{"_id":"77504476","date":{"$date":"2016-06-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2278444","reviewer_id":"55162145","reviewer_name":"Samantha","comments":"Arnie \u0026 Lorraine lead a life full of love.

Loraine's greeting and introduction to the house was pleasant. I was out early and home late so didn't see much of my hosts, in fact missed Arnie completely.  The bedroom was stylish and interesting, the bed super comfortable with good pillows and I slept really well. Nice Edwardian feel to the room but bedside lamps too weak for reading. A jug of water disappeared on the second day and never came back which was a problem because of the perilous trek to the bathroom to get a glass there and back! Which brings me to the bathroom which is spectacular and welcoming.The shower Good and reliable , the big tub looked great, I never used it. But the stairs up to the bathroom are the real problem. There's no bannister, and it is really difficult descending steadying yourself with your elbows on the walls and avoiding the art works as you clutch your clothes, towels and glass of water. Looking down the full length of the stairs with no handrail gives  me vertigo. I did appreciate the house and its atmosphere, and  the surrounding streets with the loved architecture and surprising shops was where I wanted to be ."},{"_id":"87745935","date":{"$date":"2016-07-21T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2278444","reviewer_id":"32801478","reviewer_name":"Paul","comments":"Great neighborhood and easy place to stay (for the second time)."},{"_id":"91073815","date":{"$date":"2016-08-03T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2278444","reviewer_id":"57565284","reviewer_name":"Moira","comments":"Great house and we loved staying in Paddington!

What a nice location in Lahaina! There is a mini fridge and other kitchenette-type things for guests to use on the front covered porch. \r\nThe accommodations in the room we rented appeared makeshift as the bed was set up in the literal middle of the room. The bed was comfortable and had clean linens; I pushed it up against the desk for a makeshift headboard. Although we had a half-bath to ourselves, it didn't feel private as you can easily hear everything from the other bathroom through the large shower that connects the two half-baths. I avoided using our half bath when the other guest was showering...I didn't want it to be awkward for anyone, including me. It was quite warm upstairs despite the ceiling fans in the room. Lastly, some of the animals had issues that I didn't want to dwell on while on vacation, and most of the cats were feral; not what I was expecting."},{"_id":"10952521","date":{"$date":"2014-03-14T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2279098","reviewer_id":"49913","reviewer_name":"Sean","comments":"Teri's place is comfortable, clean, and we were able to walk to dinner \u0026 a fun bar.

Walking distance to the beach, essentially your backyard, walking distance to downtown Lahaina (less than a quarter mile). Parking was easy, and the animals were fun to watch and interact with. There were a couple of issues with the room when we got there but were remedied very quickly (screen had holes, was repaired same day; room bit stuffy, was given a fan same day). The shared bathroom is an interesting experience but if you have any common sense its completely fine. The huge shower room is a great plus.

The bedroom is pretty much comfortable with a lot of fans but without A/C. During the day it's very hot in there, but who wants to stay home when there are so many beautiful beaches? At night the ocean breeze makes it cooler and I didn't feel the need for A/C at all. The private toilet and the big walk-in shower made the rest very easy. The place is very quiet and although there are many animals on the property, it's clean. Teri lives with a lot of animals, they are free but separated from the inside of the house apart from the cats that you may find laying down in the living-room: not for you if u don't go well with cats or animals in general. Teri is a vibrant and outgoing person, she has a very strong personality and welcomes you in a very warm way. Ray, a male caretaker now in charge of the housekeeping, is a very discreet person that you hardly notice, although he shares a spot in the living room, just behind the sofa.

Pete and Adam (caretakers?) helped us check in and were very friendly and helpful. Adam showed us the chickens/chicks, aviary and tortoises. It was awesome of him to take the time to show and tell us all about the animals. When we arrived back from the luau, we were greeted with a yelling, cussing Terri who was apparently panicking about a potentially lost bird and was screaming at Adam. This was our first interaction with Terri. We went up to our room and Terri later came up and apologized. I understand she was upset but it's really not the impression you should give your guests and the cussing could certainly offend people. My mom was rather bothered by how she treated Adam during the whole interaction. We left early the next morning and were blocked in by the other guests' car but Adam and Pete quickly took care of it and we were not delayed. The room itself had personal photos which was a little weird and felt a little like you were intruding on someone's personal life but also had lots of travel/reference magazines and books, and fans which helped keep the room cool.

The house itself is quite dusty and sandy,  but it's a fun and eclectic place. The best part are the tortoises and the lovely lovely dogs!\nTerry was a welcoming host and her staff were helpful and very friendly!\n\nThe only downsides were the gate into the property and the air conditioners. The gate is a pull close, obviously because of all the animals. It is a pain to close and lock every time you leave and unfortunately, the lock was right next to the garbage pile which had been sitting out in the heat for several days and really stunk! The air conditioners were also a bit of an issue. I initially started off in one room, but couldn't stay because it was too stifling hot. I moved rooms, but unfortunately had to pay the full cleaning price because I had sat on the bed and had used one of the face towels. I had asked if I could have the AC unit that was offered instead of changing rooms and paying the cleaning fee, but turns out it hasn't ever been installed and wasn't really an option. I moved to the second room, which was better, but still hot even with two fans going.

There are a lot of animals onsite (tortoises, 2 dogs, some inside cats, chickens, pigeons), which is cool if you like animals, maybe not so much if you don't. I happen to love them and thought it was pretty cool - especially the tortoises, which are enormous! \r\n\r\nOverall property was quiet and relaxing, room and living space was clean, the shower was AMAZING! \r\n\r\nHer staff was also very friendly, helpful, and fun to be around.

Her place is wonderful in so many ways. To start, we were greeted by two guys Pete and Seth. They were there throughout our whole stay and were really nice and helpful with any questions we had for them. The animals, wow, they were truly something. Their dogs, cats, turtles, birds, talking and super entertaining parrots, all made for an even more memorable stay. We were only a 10 minute walk from a historic town of Lahaina, which we enjoyed walking to and from every time. It has lots of cool shops and all kinds of restaurants and breakfast places, and of course they are all on the beach! We loved Maui, and felt like we stayed with family. And if we come back, we will definitely reach out to Kaimana and her awesome house of people and animals!

Abends dann aber hat man ihn wieder für sich.  Das Badezimmer teilt man sich sehr praktisch gelöst mit dem zweiten Airbnb Zimmer. Abends hört man das nahe gelegene Old Lahaina Luau, was richtig schön ist. Die Gockel krähen ab früh um vier, wer da empfindlich ist, Ohropax! Allerdings wird es nicht gerne gesehen, wenn man etwas kochen will, es war ein Salat, ein Beistelltisch im vergitterten Vorgarten fungiert als Küche mit ein paar Utensilien (Mikrowelle und eine Pfanne, soweit ich das im Halbdunkel sehen konnte), angeblich sei ich die erste gewesen, die das wollte. Auch kann man sich insgesamt jetzt nicht so gut im und um das Haus aufhalten. Auch muss man in der Einfahrt duschen, weil kein Sand ins Haus darf. Laheina als Ort ist sehr angenehm, tolle Strände in der Nähe und  tolle Lokale, auch fußläufig zu erreichen, wenn man keine Angst hat auf Straßen ohne Beleuchtung zu laufen. Ich war jetzt lieber immer im Auto unterwegs, was man etwas umständlich(Garagentor etwas sperrig, aber notwendig wegen der Tiere) in der Einfahrt parken kann, weil für ein Fahrrad 10.- am Tag Gebühr angefallen wären, übrigens auch für´s Waschen, an alle Weltreisenden! Die vielen Tiere sind um das Haus in Käfigen, lediglich eine große Schildkröte und Wimpi, ein süßer Hund, tappen frei herum, Kaimana achtet auch größte Sauberkeit, für die ihr staff zuständig ist, der aber ständig wechselt. In meinem Fall waren das zwei sehr nette Mädchen. Wer also lediglich ein sauberes Bett und ein halbwegs eigenes Bad sucht ist bei Kaimana richtig."},{"_id":"214898015","date":{"$date":"2017-11-26T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2279098","reviewer_id":"45098812","reviewer_name":"Ajay","comments":"Nice place to stay."},{"_id":"216804563","date":{"$date":"2017-12-05T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2279098","reviewer_id":"158893432","reviewer_name":"Steve","comments":"Great location....steps to the beach.

I was quite disappointed though by the experience of staying there.  I booked it for 2 weeks and left after 3 days. The room was much smaller than I imagined, barely enough space to walk around the bed. No table except in the closet. The \"kitchenette\" is a table in the hallway. There were a number of different electrical noises in and outside the house that made it hard for me to sleep. The atmosphere of the house was more like a youth hostel, but not at youth hostel rates, also, I'm far from youth.  The two young people who were staff there were very kind and helpful. Kaimana is a colorful character, and as she herself says, you either love her or hate her. All in all, if it were half the price, I might recommend it for younger people who have no sensitivities and want to be close to the beach."},{"_id":"245327321","date":{"$date":"2018-03-21T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2279098","reviewer_id":"172771643","reviewer_name":"Will","comments":"My girlfriend and I had a lovely stay at Kaimana's animal refuge.

I stumbled on this listing when looking for a way to visit the Lanai Cat Sanctuary during my solo trip to Hawaii. I couldn’t believe how lucky I was to find a place to stay that would involve interaction with animals and people, walking distance to: the ferry out to Lanai, best luau, really good (affordable even) ocean front restaurants for breakfast/lunch/dinner, general store for necessities, shuttle out to the larger airport area, and literally less than 1 minute walk to the beach. WHAT A GEM. At one point of my trip, I was eating by the ocean to watch the sunset. After the sun had set, I caught myself re-reading the airbnb post to this place and I thought everything was accurate and there’s so much I appreciate about this place that I actually took rest of my dinner home to enjoy it back at this airbnb. Some of the experiences that I did not expect to enjoy was having fun and meaningful conversation with both hosts Kaimana and Cammie and of course the animals! I was impressed by how clean they keep everything and all the little things they ask during your visit like keeping your car keys on the coffee table, keeping the light switches off, keeping your feet clean and shoes out of the house - all of these things are in place to help make your stay more organized and comfortable and clean. I loved being mindful of the electricity sourced from the solar panels and all the motion sensor lights that were place very thoughtfully. I prefer it much more over blasting lights in my face. This actually gave the entire place a more ambient effect in my opinion.During my solo trip I had my ups and downs about life back at home and coming home to bond with their super friendly pets, cats purring and asked to be petted totally made my day. I made sure to make time to say hi to animals on my way out and in to the place.You’d be surprised how quiet and tranquil this place is. I hardly ran into anyone and when I did it was always very pleasant and friendly exchanges. For an introvert like me, it was absolutely perfect balance of solo serenity and engaged conversations. I stayed for a week so other guest came in and out of the second/separate room but I never felt like the privacy and tranquility I needed was compromised at any level. I have many favorite moments but couple of them are: having the option to bring back food to finish my dinner while hanging out with the pets in an ambient living room, seeing cute cats to say hi to anytime I went up/down the stairs, getting drunk at a luau knowing that I can just walk back - no worries of drinking and driving, option to try..."},{"_id":"271608094","date":{"$date":"2018-06-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2279098","reviewer_id":"28345112","reviewer_name":"Laura","comments":"As a solo female traveler during my time on Maui, safety was important to me. The locked gate was easy to manage and provided a great sense of safety and autonomy. I had a bike for a portion of my stay and the bike rack within the gated area was a nice touch.\n\nI loved the eco-friendliness of the home (solar power). Despite all the animals, Kaimana and her staff do an amazing job keeping the home clean and odor free. Fans are provided and are more than sufficient for nighttime sleeping when the temperature drops. I was up early every morning so the roosters didn't bother me. If you feel warm or the animals are too loud, check out the beach- great napping spots are available and Kaimana offers beach towels. \n\nBaby beach is less than two blocks away, you can also walk, Uber, or catch a bus to other local beaches within 15 minutes.

How this property qualifies as an “animal refuge” escapes me. It is a relatively small house with dozens of animals in and around it. Neighboring homes are just a few feet away. Getting on and off the property was very difficult for me (I’m 71), having to open and shut a rolling gate across the driveway, so I really didn’t feel free to come and go as I pleased. The Host was totally inflexible and unconcerned with my discomfort and unhappiness. I left after 3 days, having paid for five nights, eating the cost of an alternative accommodation myself.

The ORM was born of the combination of the main passions of its founders: the city of Porto and its cultural characteristics; the architecture and decoration; the gastronomy and photography and, above all, the contact with different cultures.\r\n\r\nThe project is based on the support and guidance of property owners located in the center of the city who want to direct their homes to the tourism market.\r\n\r\nIt also involves the design and decoration of these same spaces, giving them a unique identity that translates into the extremely positive reaction of our guests.\r\nOur project culminates in the total management of the property, which includes the organization and preparation of these spaces for the tourist rental.\r\nSo with our dedication and daily work we have been able to please our guests who show the highest intention of repeating their experiences with our team. \r\nIn addition, besides the management, we are responsible for the constant guests' contact and that we privelege the personalized accompaniment - what distinguishes us and allows us a greater proximity to the diverse cultures.\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nQuatro amigos, muitos sonhos, um caminho em comum\r\n\r\nOporto Rental Management surgiu em 2015 pela vontade de quatro jovens amigos: a Rosa, a Tânia, o Igor e o Nuno.

This positive experience began when we arrived at the apartment. Filipa and Celso of Oporto Rental Management greeted us at the door to the condominium, escorted us to our apartment, and proceeded to give us a fantastic introduction to the city of Porto. They highlighted the city’s “can’t miss” attractions, and they did not miss on a single one. From the Livraria Lello to the São Bento Railway Station to the Douro River boat ride, all of their recommendations were well worth it. And because of the apartment's strategic location, they are all easily reachable by foot - though keep in mind that Porto is a hilly city. In addition, Filipa and Celso are kind, charming, humorous, and easy-going. We could not have asked for a better introduction to the wonderful city of Porto, and because of Filipa and Celso’s professionalism and light-heartedness, we give them, this apartment, and Oporto Rental Management our strongest and most favorable review."},{"_id":"297233947","date":{"$date":"2018-07-27T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"22811503","reviewer_id":"58673456","reviewer_name":"Clod","comments":"absolut empfehlenswert! super Lage, modern eingerichtet und es hat alles wie abgemacht funktioniert.

A few days before my trip to Hong Kong I had asked if she had an iron/ironing board in her apartment. She told me \"No, but I will try to get one for you\". The day I got to the Airbnb, I see an iron there! Moonie came through with an iron! The day I arrived Moonie also sent me a note on how the shower works, so I was not confused when I woke up the next day. The price of this Airbnb is great for what you get, but I think Moonie is the real reason why my stay was so pleasant. \n\nAs for the apartment itself, it is a great place for two people max. I went in solo and felt that I had ample space in the apartment. Then again, I really only slept and showered in the apartment. The rest of my days were filled with activities. The bed is a little on the hard side but gets comfortable once you get used to it. I am 6 foot, and it was a perfect size. The shower's water pressure was spot on!
