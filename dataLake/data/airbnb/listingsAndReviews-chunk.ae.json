The view out the bedroom and living room was really great; plantation, mountains and ocean all in one. There was plenty of silver, glasses, plates and enough pots/pans to make full meals in a full kitchen (including dishwasher). \n\nThis building has central air; semi-rare in Hawai'i. I turned it off on arrival (back on for the next person when I left) and the breeze kept the unit plenty cool for me. King size bed with extra blankets in one of the closets. Plenty of towels, there was soap and shampoo when I got there. Internet/wifi was fast, cable box in the living room with countless channel options, cable tv in both the living room and the bed room. I believe the couch was a sleeper sofa and the love seat reclined. 2 minutes down Kili Dr to as nice of beach as Oahu has to offer. Real calm water on the West side beaches in the summer months. Around 10 minutes to Wai'anae store or Tumura's, both grocery stores,  15 minutes to the northern end of Farrington Hwy with an easy/good hike out to Ka'ena Point, just over 20 min (w/out traffic) to Ko Olina. \n\nCommunication with Lynn \u0026 Ann's house keeper H. Lee was good. Gave clear instructions of what to do, how to get in the grounds and how to get into the unit. Then association/office/guards are clear on the rules and will enforce them from what other people living at MVT have said, but I felt this was a good thing. \n\nThis side of Oahu as close to 'Real Hawai'i' as you can find on Oahu as far as I'm concerned. I enjoyed it so much here I called a reality company and am thinking about buying one here instead of on the Gold Coast.

The hosts even offered us to use their snorkelling gear, which we did not get to, but perhaps on our next visit. We loved waking up to the stunning ocean and mountain views from the floor to ceiling windows that open onto a cozy lanai. The air conditioning was perfect after a hot day on the beach. The location was picturesque and while out of the big city it was close to fabulous beaches and hiking paths. The location was easy to find from the airport and the condo staff and security were friendly and helpful. Although we never met our hosts, they were quick to respond to any questions that we had. The Internet was reliable and we were thankful for the guest book that outlined great eats and attractions. Make sure you have a functioning mobile phone that works with one of the providers as the land line in the condo was not functioning during our visit.

Communication with the owners prior to arrival was wonderful. Before we arrived we knew exactly how to get to the condo, get in and where to find the grocery stores on the way. The view from the condo is spectacular and the bed is super comfy! The condo had everything that we needed; beach towels, chairs, boogie boards, cooler, and high quality snorkel gear for two. The beach at the end of the road, which is a 15-20 minute walk or a 2 minute drive was one of our favorites on the island. At times it felt like a private beach and we even saw turtles swimming at the beach with us. The location is off the beaten path, something we loved, but has easy access to the north shore and all major attractions. A rental car is a must if you want to stay here. The complex has easy parking, is quiet and full of friendly people. Though we did not use the pool (a salt water pool) and BBQ area, both were easy to access. I highly recommend staying here and hope to return in the future!

The place was everything that the write-up and reviews said it would be and more.  The view was spectacular! As others said \"just like Jurassic Park\".  It was quaint to hear the peacocks in the early morning hours (we kinda missed it after we left)  The condo was clean, spacious and comfortable.  They had items there that those traveling from places other then the island would not be able to bring--- cooler, beach mat, snorkeling equipment  and beach chair (the beach chairs were a very pleasant surprise. . . . we got to see some great sunsets in comfort!).  We were greeted daily by helpful and friendly staff at the main gate and in the office.  The one slight drawback is that the surrounding area is not very commercialized--restaurant and stores are scarce.  However with planning, we were able to use the BBQ grills at poolside.

We also visited many other spots around the island, the driving from waianae was lengthy due to less developed road system. \n\nThe condo was great, provided ample space for a couple.

We never met Lynn \u0026 Ann, but we have no doubt that had we had any issues, it would be an easy solve, especially since they provided contact information for us. At first glance the apartment was like a retro beach bungalow. There were mirrors everywhere and made the place feel very spacious and bright. I loved it and don't think they need to make any upgrades at all because everything was fully functional. We used the full kitchen a lot and appreciated having everything we needed. We shopped for groceries before arriving and was glad we did. We also used the bbq grill a few times, that area was clean and easy to use. We also used the beach chairs a lot, but didn't get a chance to use the boogie boards or snorkel gear.\r\n\r\nEveryone at the condo was extremely nice. The grounds are very well maintained and while the rules were a bit strict (we got a noticed on our door for parking our car on the line once), we appreciated how it's mostly for everyone's safety, rather than just for having rules. Makaha Beach down Kili Drive was a big highlight for staying on the leeward side. The beach had calm waters in the center and surfable waves to each end. The location was also good for exploring the other more remote beaches like Yokohama Bay and hiking to Ka'ena Point. The drawback is that the drive to other coasts was usually upwards of an hour. Even driving to Kapolei took around 40mins. Despite the drive, we were very happy with the stay. The neighborhood leading up to the condo was full of tent cities and a lot of homeless people, so that was sad to see, but we never felt unsafe. Tamura's on the way in is a great place to get poke! All in all, we loved our stay in Oahu, and this condo apartment made our trip that much more enjoyable!

The communication beforehand and during was very quick and thorough.\n\nThe view from the balcony was amazing.  The whole front wall is glass, so there was lots of light too.  There was great curtains, so you weren't bothered by the light in the morning.\n\nThe Complex is very well run by the management team.  They are very friendly and helpful, as well as very careful about who comes and goes on the property.  We felt very safe there.\n\nAlthough the apartment is older and has not been updated, it is in very good shape for it's age.  Everything works well, from appliances to plumbing.  There is \"Central Air Conditioning\" which is a HUGE plus.  It is efficient and not LOUD! All the gear that you need for the beach is included too.\n\nThe pool is lovely and the Barbeque area is clean and has high end Weber Barbeques, and picnic tables to eat at.  People tend to congregate over cooking.  We met most of the travellers down there. When we arrived, we went to Tamura's Grocery store and stocked up for the week, for only $200! We spent that in Waikiki in restaurants in 1 1/2 days!\n\nThe area, Makaha, is quite isolated. Although you can get the bus, you really need a car. We didn't mind because the travel time to other places was worth coming back to out apartment paradise.  It is 1 1/2 hours to the Northshore or the East side, an hour to Waikiki and only 1/2 an hour to Ko Olina.  Because Makaha is on the \"dry\" side, we had almost no rain, except the huge storm that hit all of the islands at once!\n\nOur favourite  beaches were Keawaula/Yokohama a 10 minute drive north of the apartment.  You can swim, sunbathe and snorkel with locals and tourists, but never very many in total at one time.  People are super friendly. The other was Ko Olina. It is a 4 Lagoon Resort 1/2 hour south where 3 big hotels are. But, you can use the beaches there, they are not private, and there is public parking for free.  They are lovely, calm and beautiful.  And you can get a restaurant fix if you need it.  There are very few restaurants in the area of the apartment.\n\nSorry for the long winded review, but we just loved our stay at Lynn and Ann's place and are trying to encourage others to have such a nice holiday as us! we will be back."},{"_id":"129245826","date":{"$date":"2017-01-29T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12409013","reviewer_id":"13971930","reviewer_name":"Marilyn Weyer","comments":"Fantastic views of both mountains and ocean.

Fabulous views and the comfiest bed ever. Which after a 27 hour journey from the UK was very welcome. However, we were very disappointed in the area. Just down the road is the largest homeless camp full of addicts. Due to the poor area there are no restaurants of any quality and the local 7-11 was robbed at gunpoint during our stay. The supermarkets are very run down. Also don't expect to sunbathe much. The mountains attract heavy could whilst the rest of the island is in beautiful sunshine.

About a mile from great beaches, and close to hiking. \n\nThe Makaha Towers are well run, with many friendly and helpful staff. While the rooms are handicapped accessible, unfortunately the pool is not. \n\nThis condo is a great place to stay, the hosts were easy to communicate with and they outfitted the place completely.

As many reviewers have said, it's a fair drive to get to most places on the island and traffic can be crazy busy in rush hour but the drive is gorgeous. You just need to leave time to get somewhere. The bus system comes regularly but it's a long ride to Honolulu if that's where you need to go. Tamura's grocery has real good prices and a great selection. For those looking for chain restaurants, it's about a half hour drive but local restaurants are a great option.

On the 10th floor with gorgeous views of the ocean and mountains, peacocks love to hang around the property and make for a great sight! The property has a swimming pool that was very clean and accessible, no issues with noise or rude tenants. Security was very nice and tight, we felt very safe.Many items were provided in the condo including basic toiletries, beach chairs, and snorkeling gear! \n\nA few things to be aware of that should NOT deter you from staying here-- getting in/out of this side of the island is difficult as there is only 1 way in and out. Plan on at least a 30 minute drive out before hitting the highway, when traffic is low. At peak traffic times you are looking at a 1 hour 30 minute drive to Honolulu or North Shore. Traffic in that area gets bad as there are many schools along this one road. The beaches in this area get crowded with locals and many homeless people. Weekends wouldn't be a good time to go to the beach on this side of the island but on the weekdays it was serene, clean, and everything you could want!! \n\nI am so glad we made the decision to stay here and are looking forward to our return!!"},{"_id":"259334566","date":{"$date":"2018-05-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12409013","reviewer_id":"92653371","reviewer_name":"Jordan \u0026 Leon","comments":"Be aware of the location, it's a drive to get to any other part of the island.

Kitchen was stocked with everything you need to whip up a meal (besides the groceries of course) Lots of towels were provided, and some good beach gear (snorkeling gear, boogie boards, umbrella, etc) The buildings are very easy to navigate, this apartment being in core 2.

Highly recommend this place, will probably try to book it again if I’m ever back in the area!"},{"_id":"346365109","date":{"$date":"2018-11-08T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12430621","reviewer_id":"198468135","reviewer_name":"Victor","comments":"Estube tres días en casa de Txus y todo fue genial.

We were in Barcelona for 5 days and had a bit of rain but he made sure we had all the conforts and information we needed to make the best of our stay. The house was clean and tidy. It was a bit further from the city centre than expected, maybe because I had little idea of the distances in the city itself. It allows for a 15 min walk to Sagrada Família through the wonderful neighboorhood's flat terrain. Do not try to walk to Parq Guell, looks closer than it is, it's straight uphill (we kinda did eheheh). The buses are 5-10min walk away, and the metro is 10min away.

The parking is a little misrepresented in the current listing, as it is several blocks away and during 90% of our stay, it was occupied by an unauthorized vehicle. We asked Tyler about this, and he said he couldn't do anything to make them move. There was also an air mattress available, but no pump or linens to go with it so we couldn't use it. Overall, we enjoyed staying in this area (lots of great shops and restaurants, close to the Centre Bell if you're attending an event) and the apartment is beautiful, but we had constant headaches arise from the parking situation. I'd have given a higher rating had the listing been more specific in this regard or had the situation been resolved more to our satisfaction."},{"_id":"95008518","date":{"$date":"2016-08-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12486648","reviewer_id":"18649502","reviewer_name":"Sara","comments":"The apartment was as described, clean and perfectly located.

When we stepped into the room, it smells like curry or some weird things. We thought it will disappear if we open the back door(no windows), but it became worse(there might be some restaurants close to the backyard). We report this to Tyler, he didn't reply, so we told his friend and then he was arguing with us and he said that I am complaining for no reason. He even suggested me to buy a refresher in Dollar store! \n\nWe were very upset, not only the bad smell, but also the dirty old quilt. We tried to take a nap, but people live on the second floor were laughing so loud and traffic outside was noisy. So we decided to move to a hotel. I asked Tyler about this, he didn't reply, but he sent another friend to reply us that he will give us full refund, and we can leave the key in the room then move to a hotel. But after we arrived at the hotel, Tyler finally replied us and said he won't refund us! I tried to communicate with him but he just disappeared again!\n\nWe already reported this to Airbnb, one warning to the future guest: never trust the pictures!!"},{"_id":"100346743","date":{"$date":"2016-09-08T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12486648","reviewer_id":"9017305","reviewer_name":"Angel","comments":"Tyler's place is perfectly located for a visit to Montreal.

The apartment is really nice and comfortable. The kitchen table and seat are beautiful. It could be a little bit cleaner (some kitchen utensils needed washing) and more organized (sink cabinet and closet were messy) but no big deal. The apartment is in the first floor of an old house and it seems it's under some renovation in the basement. So the entrance is all dusty and it may cause a not very good first impression. I hope they'll improve that soon, but overall it's a great place. Super close to metro stations, restaurants, attractions.

No central heating (had to use space heaters, which wasn't bad with the mild weather, but I can't imagine it being enough in the dead of a Montréal winter), no working oven or stovetop (one of the main reasons I airbnb instead of hotel) and a foyer and totally inaccessible backyard that are completely trashed and under construction. When I arrived, the building owner came by to do some work inside the apartment while I was unpacking and settling in.

The place is very nice. There is also a TV on a wall mount so you could watch TV from the bed. Erol is very kind and was very helpful with our problems. The location was also very good. It was nice to know we had a secure parking spot.\n\nUnfortunately, we ran into a few difficulties while staying here. First, the parking spot was relocated to a parking lot about 5 minutes away, which isn't too bad, but it drizzled one night and we didn't have umbrellas. Second, the place was slightly chilly. It is heated by two heaters that you plug in. We left the heater on while we were away and when we returned it was a good temperature. This may be due to the renovations going on in the rest of the house. Third, we ran into some power issues where the outlets on one side of the house went out, as well as the wifi. We called Erol and he had the issue fixed by the time we returned. Again, may be due to the state of the building itself. Lastly, although the apartment was clean for the most part, the couch had a bit of cat/animal hair, which got into our clothes. \n\nOverall, our stay was not bad. Erol/Tyler are slow with responding to messages sometimes, but they were quick to respond when we called.

Close to shopping, restaurants and bars.

Tyler's friend who dropped off the key was very friendly and accomodating to our delayed arrival and also brought us air fresheners to help mask the incredibly unpleasant lingering dog smell and was at our disposal for any questions or needs which was nice. \n\nThe unit overall is great for visitors wanting something basic in a buzzing location. There is no heating in the unit so we had to rely on the small portable heater, so just bare in mind during cold winter times. The Tv remote batteries didn't work and the lock on the front door was touchy. In terms of accuracy of photos, the unit had charm with the open brick walls but the decor had a rather interesting collaboration of rather dated pieces of furniture and modern additions as well.

Convenient location, very close to the Metro and downtown shopping, or if you are going to a hockey game or have meetings at Concordia or McGill. The free parking spot is a couple of blocks away, but is a great bonus. One caveat about the location: this end of downtown is still a little on the seedy side at night. Not unsafe, but not the most picturesque neighbourhood: panhandlers, guys sleeping in doorways, etc. If you're used to this kind of thing and know what to expect, it's fine. \nHowever, the space is in an old house that doesn't look like it's been renovated elsewhere. The biggest issue, especially for a Canadian winter, is there doesn't seem to be any central heating. Steam radiators were not working. The only heat source in the apartment was from a wall mounted fan/heat/ac unit that was too small for the square footage and did not heat the space adequately. Since there was no heat coming from the rest of the house (the stairway and vestibule are old and unheated), it was extremely cold. The bathroom was freezing. My husband likes a cooler room for sleeping but he said it was way too cold even for him. We checked out the second day and moved to a hotel. I have to say that Tyler was extremely apologetic, gave us no issues and refunded the second night immediately. Very courteously handled. He also said he would address the issue for the future--if you are planning on staying here during the colder months, I would check to see if the heat problem has been fixed."},{"_id":"212166367","date":{"$date":"2017-11-16T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12486648","reviewer_id":"139690806","reviewer_name":"Caitlyn","comments":"First time using airbnb, and it was a great experience. \nTyler was very helpful and clear with communication, there were no surprises, which is the last thing you want when travelling.\nPlace was clean, great location right downtown, easy to get to shops, food and transit. \nWe only stayed a couple of nights, but he seemed to have all the amenities for a long stay as well. \nWould definitely go back! \nThank you Tyler!"},{"_id":"212998241","date":{"$date":"2017-11-19T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12486648","reviewer_id":"150608110","reviewer_name":"Sam","comments":"Tyler has a very nice place in a great location.

They are really open with communication. Checking in several times before check on and even after. They give instructions to the T, and that is extremely helpful for someone visiting someplace new. They are extremely flexible and accommodating. Their place is super convenient to downtown area. For our stay we left our car parked and walked everywhere. There's wifi, and Netflix available in the apartment. The heat in the apartment doesn't really ventilate through the entire place, so it was definitely cold and I would suggest bringing extra hoodies and sweats for sleeping in during the colder months. They were nice enough to provide a portable space heater in the bathroom and we ended up moving it between the bathroom ( showering \u0026 getting ready) and sleeping area (the rest of the day) a lot. This really helps warm up the sleeping area and made it more comfortable.\n\nWe had some issues with parking upon arrival (the building next door was doing construction and all the scaffolding was in the parking spot. They were super proactive and immediately took care of this issue that same day, renting us another spot at the same parking area. Thanks for that guys!\n\nThe block where the entrance of the building is, construction is going on and it blocks the entrance of the door. It's a little confusing, but everything is golden once you get into the apartment! I'll definitely come back if I'm in the area \u0026 will def recommend their place to everyone.

It was extremely clean inside, had a fully stocked kitchen, a great bathroom, and it was in a part of town that had a metro a short walk away with plenty of cheap places (and expensive places too) to eat around it. While I was staying, construction was being done on the building, so there was some loud building noises going on under me during the day, but nothing to keep me up at night and most of the time I was walking around the city so it ended up not being a problem. Tyler's place itself is beautiful on the inside. The pictures are exactly what it looked like, and they gave us fresh towels and left shampoo/conditioner. The only issue I had was with the parking spot, it was incredibly close to a building and I had a hard time getting into it, as it was icy and another car had parked close. It took me and my bf around 20 mins to get into and out of the spot. We were able to work it out though, and it was nice to have parking in Montreal considering it is a packed city. Overall a great and very fun stay."},{"_id":"243599636","date":{"$date":"2018-03-16T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12486648","reviewer_id":"17090920","reviewer_name":"Maggie","comments":"Great space and back deck!

The parking space is in very tight quarters and we were a little uncertain as to whether we were in the right spot at first but we were thankful for the option because there was nowhere else close that we could have parked our car.  Tyler is a very accommodating host, giving great suggestions for things to do in Montreal while we were there as well as checking in to make sure we were doing well during our stay.  He is quick to respond to messages and we appreciated his friendliness.  His place is just off of busy Rue St. Catherine where there is lots of places to eat and shop.  It is also close proximity to the art galleries, Mont Royal, a grocery store and pharmacy.  If you want to head downtown to Old Montreal it is also pretty close (we opted to walk because it was a nice day and it took us about 40 minutes).

Along with the uniqueness of this property, a one of a kind, Shangri’La offers “Old Hawaii” at its best with a Balinese flair.  The privacy, the lagoons, the 4 separate pavilions, the waterfall, endless palm trees, and 90 degree volcanically heated ocean water, the friendly fish, with 2 private islands, lend itself to the description we most hear from guests: “It’s Heaven on Earth!”  The indoor/ outdoor design makes you feel like you’re on a private island somewhere and completely one with the tropics.

It took a while for us to get acclimated to the heat and humidity, but we were dealing with it like champs by the last day. Beds were comfortable and the kitchen was great for cooking meals. Our favorite part was the master outdoor shower; it was fun to shower under the blue skies or stars, along with geckos and coqui frogs! We struggled a little bit with mosquitoes and gnats, but that's really just a part of being mostly outdoors. The round house was great for relaxing and working (yes, sometimes we had to). I liked sitting on the bridge in the mornings to drink my morning coffee with the fishes. We went on a lava boat tour which was unforgettable and highly recommended if you don't mind rough seas. We also enjoyed soaking in the pools at Ahalanui Beach, a short drive away. Thanks for the great stay!"},{"_id":"121053727","date":{"$date":"2016-12-13T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12507567","reviewer_id":"94136657","reviewer_name":"Jamie","comments":"Shangri-La is an amazing place and hard to compare to other rentals.

First the positives.  The lagoon is great for kids aged 5-10 who are new to snorkeling and its always fun for them to feed the fish everyday.  The landscaped grounds, beds, lines, bathrooms and laundry room are well appointed for this type of rental.  The property manager is very helpful as well.  Now the negatives.  First, the house has a strange layout with too many doors which makes it somewhat annoying to move around.  The two primary bedrooms are connected by a short hallway and so I would recommend against anyone hoping for privacy (like two couples).  Speaking of rooms, the unique island room is VERY exposed so whoever stays there must be comfortable with that (like a child).  The last room (called guest house) is also a ways from the master so families expecting young children to stay there, be careful.  As mentioned in some of the other reviews there are bugs here, and lots of them.  My kids were ravaged by mosquitoes and the kitchen was overrun by ants if you left even a crumb out.  You should also fully understand where the house is on the island relative to your intended primary activities.  You are far from the ideal snorkeling and water activities of Kona and the volcano crater is an hour away itself.  Lastly,  while the owner is very nice and communicative, he suffers from exaggeration.  For example, to say there are \"thousands\" of fish in the lagoon is outrageous.  And the local snorkeling is nothing like the Kona side.  And the couch shouldnt be considered a bed when its not even a pullout.  And don't think there is true \"access to the ocean\" - you can peak at it from someone's yard basically or walk a few blocks to a path.  Overall this is again a unique property and we enjoyed our stay for the most part, but we are adventurous.  We had 2 adults and 4 kids.  I wouldn't go above 4-5 ideally.  Happy to answer any questions objectively if you contact me.

Een prima plek om van daaruit Barcelona te bekijken. Het is een appartement op de 4e verdieping van een appartementencomplex waarin niet in gewoond wordt, uitsluitend voor AirBnB gebruik. \nHet appartement ligt zeer gunstig t.o.v. openbaar vervoer. Met de metro en bus kan je alle kanten op en Barcelona makkelijk doorkruisen. In een half uur zijn alle highlights bereikbaar. Tip: koop 10 rittenkaarten bij de automaten. Die zijn goedkoop en in meerdere vormen van OV te gebruiken. \nMarisa is vriendelijk en snel in de communicatie. Ze zegt geen Engels te spreken, maar redt zich er goed mee. \nHet appartement deed wat kleiner aan dan de foto's doen vermoeden. Je kunt er met z'n zessen slapen. Maar met 5 vonden wij het al vol. Er is 1 tweepersoonsbed (prima), 2 afzonderlijke bedden (wat hard) en 1 slaapbank (ook prima) die de woonkamer aardig vult. \nBuiten was het tegen de 30 graden overdag, wat maximaal zakte naar 25 s'nachts. Dan is het appartement warm. Er is 1 airco aanwezig die dan het appartement niet als geheel weet te koelen. De woonkamer is dan wel koel. Een raam open zetten kan. Maar vanaf buiten komt dan wel geluid van verkeer. Carrer de Padilla is niet de drukste straat, maar er rijdt wel wat doorheen. \nDe badkamer en keuken zijn prima. De wasmachine en droger een zegen. We hebben 1 tip meegegeven aan Marisa: voorzien in voorzorgsmaatregelen voor brand. In het appartement en in het complex is daarvan niets te bekennen. En dat zou wel verstandig zijn.

While the first is more bohemian, very lively, famous for its night-life and  next to the Bosporus, the later is much more affluent, elegant and full of specialized restaurants and internationally renown designer shops. Both are pretty, safe, very central and share an exiting lifestyle.  Everything is steps away or very nearby; gorgeous parks, mosques, Taksim and the TOP TOURIST ATTRACTIONS.  I'm surrounded by a huge array of cafes, restaurants, shops, bars and live music venues; all this contributes to making Beşiktaş one of the most sort after districts in Istanbul. Yet I live at a quiet and safe street. Witin 1 to 2 min walk: a hospital and pharmacy (at the corner) 3 supermarkets, including the cheapest chain in all of Turkey. The Saturday bazaar/farmer's market with very fresh and some organic products, only 150 meters away.  My street is quiet and with a line of trees. The Bosporus is a short walk away, f","notes":"For avid walkers; the walk to TAKSIM trough Maçka park it's wonderful and it only takes about 25 min to reach Tksm. Or if you take the CABLE-CAPSULE (\"teleferik\") you can cross the park and have a gorgeous view from above and save a few min walk. You could even walk further to GALATA tower within 50 min (20 from Taksim square) and keep going down to Karaköy, only 5 min from Galata and another 10 min to Eminönū to the wonderful Spice bazaar and the Yeni mosque. All together you can walk from home to Eminönū in a bit more than 1 hr.","transit":"**There are 3 bus routes that pass by the corner of the flat (130m) They go to TAKSIM, another to EMINÖNŪ (Spice bazaar) Karaköy \u0026 Yeni Kapı (very near the Blue mosque). 5 min walk there's the dolmuş (collective taxi) that goes to Taksim  in about 5 min. **Osmanbey metro is 15 min walk. This metro can lead you to Atatūrk airport within one hour with a short-easy change at Yeni Kapı. **Kabataş tram that leaves you at the door of the Blue mosque, Aiğa Sofia,  the spice and Grand Bazaars is 25 min walk or 1 bus ride away from this corner. Optional; taxi to Kabataş in 6 min and costs about €2.5 ** The ferries to Ūskūdar only take 5 minutes to reach ASIA! Or 20 min by luxurious ferry to Kadiköy (only 70 euro cents) From Beşiktaş centre there's another dolmuş to Taksim (5-7 min ride) and a huge selection of buses to go all around and mainly the most beautiful palaces in the city and near the Black Sea at Sarıyer!","access":"You can access all areas except the other bedroom.

We took the tram, bus, ferry and train after purchasing an octopus card all around HK. The hosts provide detailed instructions when checking in yourself and are always available to answer questions.

I had to message the management service to find out any information and was only told someone was on the way - but no time indication.\nWe asked where would we find a grocery store and again Louisa did not have this information, nor recommendations. \nThe door to the apartment jammed and she could not get it opened, luckily my husband was able to 'pound' on the door to help us get in. When we tested the door to get out of the apartment again, she was unable to open the door. If my husband had not been with me, I or any women would not be able to get in or out of the apartment. Louisa said she would report this problem and hopefully, it will be resolved before the next people arrive. \nI would recommend this apartment when visiting Porto for location, and general facilities in the apartment.

The house was quite old so you can hear the neighbours (especially the ones upstairs) very well and there is also some noise from the street, but this is to be expected with such a centrally located apartment. Minor negative points: when we arrived, the place hadn't been cleaned yet so we had to hurredly leave our luggage in the apartment and go, so we didn't have time to relax or freshen up after our trip. But those are just details because when we came back, the place was very tidy. Communicating with the owner was very easy and someone waited for us at arrival to show us the apartment.

Keep in mind this is one of many apts managed by a business, not a private homeowner. I arrived before the 2p check-in time and I was able to grab the key earlier, but at their office, a 10-15 minute drive away. I went to the apt to drop off the luggage but the hosts hadn't told the cleaning crew we'd be coming by earlier, like I asked them to, so they were taken by surprise, and was obviously irritated we were there, only even for 10 minutes to freshen up before leaving. Between that and the clogged shower from day 1, loud upstairs neighbor who would consistently stomp overnight and wake me up, I had just an okay experience. However, the location is fantastic, the apt was fairly clean besides a couple stains on the bedding, and the wifi was fast."},{"_id":"200017384","date":{"$date":"2017-10-03T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12552675","reviewer_id":"2096342","reviewer_name":"Eric","comments":"Isabel was a fantastic host.

Recalcar la amabilidad del chico que nos hizo la recepción y se le notaba incluso a él que esa situación no le agradaba. Nos dijo que podíamos dejar las maletas y que volvieramos en una hora.

One direction was a few blocks to the beach, another to nice shopping in Leblon or for a jog around the lagoon. I did not need to take taxi anywhere, subway station was a few blocks away and everything I needed was within walking distance. I would highly recommend to a respectful guest looking for tranquility and a quality stay in Rio De Janeiro.

Every Wednesday morning there's a lovely fresh food market 3 minutes walk away at the end of our street.   When you see all the marvellous things in our neighbourhood set out in our guide you will see why we think we are in the best area and best street in Rio!   Copacabana Beach for us is much more interesting, day and night, than Ipanema and the range of shops and quality of life in Copa somehow seems much more real-world...a fantastic experience living like a true Carioca (native of Rio)! We have everything on hand, but perhaps what we love most best is the ease of just a 5-minute walk home to our residential tree-lined street feeling you are escaping from the lively beach area, or the big parties at New Year and Carnival!","notes":"No more than two people can stay here - we can put an airbed in if the two people do not want to share the double bed.  For short stays we can make an exception if the third person is a child but only by prior agreement using the airbed.   Our street is residential and quiet compared to the busy avenues nearby - there is some background sound of Rio traffic and street life.     We don´t notice it, but you may if you are a light sleeper. Please think twice before using the aircon in order to be more environmentally friendly and to keep the costs down!  The ceiling fan is very effective and more gentle.  Please turn both off when not in the studio.","transit":"We are only 3 minutes from the Siquiera Campos stop on the main metro line which connects us to Ipanema  (two stops - 5 minutes) and to the centre of Rio (8 stops - 12 minutes).

There is also a safe and reliable taxi rank within 100 metres, and we have our own driver contact for personalised airport transfers or trips to other towns like Paraty or Buzios. It's also a lovely walk to Ipanema - about 30 mins along the beach front.","access":"What you WILL find: internet - cable and wifi air conditioning ceiling fan and light fridge microwave toaster filter coffee machine kettle single ring cooker stove fan heater tap water filter (so no need to buy bottled water) flat-screen TV with international cable channels plentiful wall sockets, all 110 volts (like most of Rio).

We'll do as much as we can to make your stay easy and memorable.","host_response_time":"within an hour","host_thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/624433/profile_pic/1306350317/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","host_picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/624433/profile_pic/1306350317/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","host_neighbourhood":"Copacabana","host_response_rate":100,"host_is_superhost":false,"host_has_profile_pic":true,"host_identity_verified":true,"host_listings_count":1,"host_total_listings_count":1,"host_verifications":["email","phone","facebook","reviews","jumio","government_id"]},"address":{"street":"Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","suburb":"Copacabana","government_area":"Copacabana","market":"Rio De Janeiro","country":"Brazil","country_code":"BR","location":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-43.18822800527058,-22.97000440296209],"is_location_exact":true}},"availability":{"availability_30":25,"availability_60":55,"availability_90":85,"availability_365":321},"review_scores":{"review_scores_accuracy":10,"review_scores_cleanliness":10,"review_scores_checkin":10,"review_scores_communication":10,"review_scores_location":10,"review_scores_value":10,"review_scores_rating":100},"reviews":[{"_id":"307212","date":{"$date":"2011-06-10T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"125656","reviewer_id":"287354","reviewer_name":"Rasmus","comments":"This is a great little apartment on a quiet tree-lined street about two and a half blocks from the beach.  It is close to everything including the Siqueira Campos Metro stop which is a big plus if you need to get to downtown Rio. There are parts of Copacabana that are quite a trek from the Metro. There are all sorts of restaurants within a block in all directions and of course the beach a 5-minute walk away.\r\n\r\nEverything is brand new and the apartment feels modern and cozy at the same time. It is however quite small. I was there by myself for 4 nights and it was perfect. Great for a couple as well if you get along really well. I wouldn't try to put 3 people in this place. When the bed is unfolded there is very little floor space left. The little space there is actually feels a lot bigger because it is very organized. It is easy to keep tidy since there is really only one place to put each thing. The handy apartment guide shows you where things go, how to unfold the sofa into the various configurations, and has some tips on the area. \r\n\r\nThere is both wired and wireless Internet which was fast and worked perfectly for me. There is a nice little flat screen TV with satellite channels and easily accessible hdmi ports so you can hook up your laptop and play your own content. Sometimes wall-mounted flat screens make it really hard to get to the hdmi ports, but not in this case.\r\n\r\nNote that power outlets in Brazil come in about 4 different flavours and you can never really be sure whether it is 110V or 220V. So bring adapters and make sure anything you plug in won't be fried by being plugged into a 220V outlet. In this apartment all (and there are surprisingly many) the outlets are IEC-906-1 type plugs at 220V. It is 3-pronged but still 2-prong Europlug compatible so if you are coming from most of Europe you won't need adapters. If you are coming from North America, bring some regular US-Euro adapters.\r\n\r\nThe view of Cristo Redentor (Christ the Redeemer statue) is especially nice at sunset and in the evening when it is lit up. There is a shot of it at sunset taken from the window of the apartment here: (Website hidden by Airbnb) \r\n\r\nAlan and Catherine were lightning quick to respond and made the process extremely smooth.\r\n\r\nAll in all this was a perfect and relaxing 4 nights in Copacabana for me."},{"_id":"337941","date":{"$date":"2011-06-27T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"125656","reviewer_id":"673310","reviewer_name":"Mercedes","comments":"Hola a todos!!

This studio is simply amazing!\r\n\r\nAlan and Catherine's studio is a beautiful place to stay. The creative design and artistic details are inspiringly put together. It is also wonderful because it is situated in the heart of Copa. Very close to the shops, the beach, the metro, and major tourist attractions. Location and design are the perfect combo to make your stay comfortable and rewarding!\r\n\r\nAlan is such a kind, polite and thoughtful person! I will not forget his kindness. He went above and beyond to make my stay a happy one. In fact, he went well and beyond my expectations of a land lord. He even helped me organise a taxi to leave and booked it for me. Alan also arranged to get the apartment cleaned mid-stay. I did not ask him to do this. In sum, you could not want nicer person to deal with! Alan is a rare gem! He responds to emails in a timely manner and is a generous, helpful and wonderful!  He thinks of everything to make your stay a happy one!\r\n\r\nThe apartment building is nice and the couple that work at the door and look after the cleaning are such warm, kind and beautiful Brazilian people!!! They helped me so much with many things. When I arrived my luggage was missing, so they rang the airport and even offered to drive me to the airport! They even helped me go shopping for electrical goods so I could use my computer. Outstanding kindness!!!  It was a joy to come and home and say hello to them on the way to the elevator. I will miss them very much!\r\n\r\nThe apartment is comfortable because every last detail has been very well considered. Coming from Australia, I found the internet speed very fast and easy to connect. The cable TV is excellent and nice to watch after a long day touring Rio! The kitchen is perfect and is a delightful place to make yummy breakfast etc. The bathroom is very well designed. While the living room and bedroom is a joy to be in due to the artwork and beautiful use of form and light. The use of colour in the studio is visually sophisticated and joyful. I really loved the use of design to create atmosphere and mixed with Brazilian art, this is a real treat to enjoy! Loved it!!!\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed dealing with Alan and Catherine. They are perfect hosts and I will be coming back to stay again for sure! Thank you so much Alan and Catherine for letting me stay in your beautiful home. I had the best time and will always remember how lovely your home and your wonderful kindness! \r\n\r\nThank you!!!!!!

I am a newcomer to this fantastic forum and had no recommendations or much detail in my profile while the apartment that Alan and Catherine entrusted me with truly is their home in Rio. It is a lovely designed little gem in Copa. It is amazing to see how much thought this couple spent in developing this small apartment into a little home where everything just fits perfectly. \r\n\r\nThe apartment is light during day and the sofa transforms into a most comfortable bed at night. When I read the description of the apartment I initially had my doubts about the sleeper coach but chose this apartment as all other things just sounded perfect. Well, it turned out that the sleeper couch is as perfect as the apartment proved to be. The most comfortable sleeper I have ever experienced!\r\n\r\nThe apartment was recently totally renovated and is kept in such good shape that it still feels new. One of the apartment's big asset (apart from its beautiful furniture and interior) is the large shower! And of course the aircon for the hot Rio summer nights!\r\n\r\nThe apartment is nearby a vast range of fair, good and excellent restaurants and various supermarkets and shops.\r\n\r\nThe special treat is the welcome pack which allows you some time to study the wonderful recommendations and tips Allan and Catherine provide you with in a little info brochure to assist you in finding your own way in the surrounding area. Alan also offed a Kyle chat to assist me finding my way, but I found the info provided so detailed that this was not necessary.\r\n\r\nAs with most apartments in Rio, security is tops with a watchfull 24/7 door guard, who by the way is always keen to help where he can.\r\n\r\nThe Wifi is pleasantly fast and reliable! \r\n\r\nI can only recommend Alan's and Catherine's home in Rio. It is stable for short term, for long term, for business or for just visiting Copa (which, if i may stray off the point :) ) should be on everyones list of things to do while you still can!!!!!)\r\n\r\nThank Alan, thanks Catherine!

They were extremely fast in responding to our quires and we had a good few especially as it was over carnival (They even responded to out quires during our week in the apartment and helped us with a problem we were having booking flights to Iguazu falls). The studio is ideally situated in a very safe area (although we found nearly everywhere in Rio to be very safe) that is perfect for exploring Copacabana and the surrounding areas. The city itself can be somewhat overwhelming at first but Alan and Catherine’s starter and information packs gave us the confidence to venture all over they city without hesitation. Carnival is an amazing time to go and it is good to have somewhere private to go back to after a long day or night at a bloc party (which you will run into everywhere). As a first time couple using this site we could not have been more happy with the outcome and it really made our trip to Rio carnival one we will never forget. So all that’s left to say is go and in stay in Alan and Catherine’s beautiful apartment, don’t believe the negative things you hear about Rio and bring a wig or a hat for carnival as you wont see a local without one :)"},{"_id":"1032232","date":{"$date":"2012-03-22T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"125656","reviewer_id":"1376452","reviewer_name":"Tom And Cecilia","comments":"Our experience with Alan and Catherine's apartment in Rio was a dream experience.  Our first time in Rio, we were faced with a 1:00 AM arrival at GIG.   Already wary of what I had read about airport taxi, I wondered how we were going to deal with this one.  No problem, everything was promptly arranged with their trusted driver who was at the airport promptly with our name and a reaonsable cost. \r\n\r\nThe apartment is on a beautiful quaint street in the heart of Copacabana.  Building security is fantastic with trusted 24 hr porters,  restricted access to the floors.  We felt much safer than in a hotel -- but Rio  not to be construed as an unsafe city.  We felt fine everywhere we went.  The metro is clean and efficient.  \r\n\r\nEverything in the apartment is well organized and works.  The high speed internet permitted flawless (Hidden by Airbnb) calls at all hours - a great stress reliever when you're on business.\r\n\r\nAlan and Catherine responded immediately to al communications, offered tons of helpful information about the area, checked in frequently to see if anything needed.

The studio is great! It is very well designed. Everything works perfectly well and Internet is faster than what we have in Switzerland! The location is great too! About 5 minutes walk to the beach of Copacabana, and located in a safe neighborhood. The bus station to go to the Sugar Loaf is about 10 minutes walk and the subway and the supermarket are only 3 minutes walking distance. Ipanema is only a 30 minute walk or you can take the subway (2 stations). Catherine and Alan were very helpful in helping us organize our trip. They were very patient with all our questions and fast in responding emails. They also helped us book our transportation to the apartment and all went very smoothly. We also loved the handbook loaded with all sorts of recommendations. We tried out a few restaurants and were not disappointed. We also went to Churrascaria Carretao (10 minutes walk) as my husband loves grilled meat (very touristy, get there early to avoid the tourist buses!). The hotel Othon has a restaurant on the top floor with a beautiful view of the beach of Copacabana. The food is rather pricey but the view is definitely worth it! The restaurant Colombo in the Fort of Copacabana is supposed to be good too, unfortunately we ran out of time! There are some very nice markets on Sundays. When heading to the hippie market in Ipanema stop at this very small market off Avenida Atlantica just before the Fort of Capacabana! They sell great pastels and the best caldos de cane! There is also an information center on Copacabana only a few minutes  towards Leme...

It was my first time to Rio and to South America although it was not my first time renting an apartment on vacation rather than a hotel room.  So, I have experiences to compare this one to.  Alan \u0026 Catherine are first class individuals.  I have never had an experience with such personal attention and with genuine concern for my stay and for the overall success of my trip.  The hosts are exceptional and I imagine I won't have such good fortune again because they truly go above and beyond what you as a guest would expect of them as hosts.  They are in contact regularly and respond readily (even though they are several time zones away!)  Although I did not have the opportunity to meet them in person, you would think that you did, by the level of comfort you will have with them.  I have stayed in apartments around the world and never had such attentive hosts.\r\nTheir place is in a perfect location...a short walking distance to the beach, near restaurants, shops and the metro.  You couldn't ask for a better location in Copa.  Please know it is a very safe area.  I never felt unsafe at any time.  Their apartment is delightful...cheery and modern and clean.  What more could you ask for?  I will return to Rio and will check to see if their apartment is available.  I highly recommend the space for one or two people.  (I am a single male from Chicago.)  They have a wonderful local lady who meets you upon arrival and cares for the apartment and they also have a driver who is friendly and courteous and helpful.  He met me at the airport and also for the return trip to the airport.  My trip was a great success and staying at a place that made me happy was a large part of my happiness with this trip!  Kudos Alan \u0026 Catherine!  You are a joy to work with!

Do take a note of places in Rio that Alan suggests. We very much liked our excursion to Santa Teresa as well as very bohemian confectionary/cafe in the Centro. \n\nThe apartment is in great location, right in the heart of Copacabana. It is located on a very cute tree lined street within 5 min walk to the world's most famous beach. Also, the metro station was just around the corner which we found very helpful since we used metro a lot to explore the city. \n\nThe apartment itself is very clean, bright and pleasant. Alan and Catherine did a great job decorating the place and making sure it has everything for the comfortable living. The space was functional with all modern amenities and comfortable bed.

The arrangement worked out perfectly - from the first moment of contact the hosts were so helpful; knowing that the two of us coming were friends they adapted the studio to our needs, putting in a spare single bed and adjusting the space accordingly so that we would be comfortable. We were given so much help and advice on everything ranging from places to eat in Rio, which banks to use, best ways of travelling around, recommended ways of getting to Sao Paolo where we went to watch a semi-final match overnight, etc. \r\n  Once there we really enjoyed our stay - it is a studio flat but the space has been put to such good use that we never felt cramped or on top of each other. The welcome pack when we arrived was just that - very welcoming! We loved Copacabana itself; it felt very safe, and there are so many places to go to all within a short distance; the biggest problem we had was being selective! Alan and Catherine's guide is extremely helpful and the fact that there was wifi at the flat almost meant that we could book online for trips like the visit to el Cristo Corcovado (which saved us a long queue and several hours of waiting.)  We also appreciated the fact that Alan kept in touch whilst we were there to ask if we needed help with anything, etc. \r\n  So all in all it was a very positive experience and I would highly recommend the apartment, whether you are travelling on your own, as part of a couple or with a friend, as it can be adapted to suit your needs!

I’ll certainly choose it for my next stay in Rio.\n"},{"_id":"93175886","date":{"$date":"2016-08-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"125656","reviewer_id":"9366410","reviewer_name":"Kasia","comments":"Alan and Catherine were extremely welcoming and helpful with our stay in Rio.

It is a small, cozy, beautifully decorated space, in a great area of Copacabana. It is perfect for a couple, with a comfy bed, and surprisingly big shower. It is very close to Copacabana beach, and even  within walking distance to Ipanema, and the lake. There are lots of restaurants and shopping around.\n\nFrom the moment I booked the place, Alan and Catherine communicated with me quickly, clearly and in a very friendly manner. I felt welcomed right away, and that left me no doubt that I had found the right place.\n\nThis proved true as soon as I arrived, as we were able to catch an earlier flight, at the last minute, from São Paulo to Rio. I emailed Alan from the airport letting him know of the situation, and he was able to make all the arrangements for us to go directly to the apartment upon arrival in Rio - 3 hours before our original arrival time!!!\n\nAlan had recommended for me to contact Marcio for transportation from the airport to the apartment. Marcio was friendly and also very flexible, and was able to pick us at the airport at the earlier arrival time.\n\nWhen we got to the apartment, Hugo was already waiting for us. He helped us with our luggage, and took us up to the place. The studio was immaculately clean, and ready for us to use. Moreover, Alan had arranged for us to have fresh fruit, bread, ham, cheese, cookies, etc!!\n\nThat was a totally unexpected, wonderful surprise!!! With all the attentions from Marcio, and Hugo, plus the fruits and snacks Alan had arranged, we definitely felt like we had come to the right place!!!!\n\nI highly recommend Alan's and Catherine's studio, and would absolutely stay there again. What's more, I would love to meet them someday, as they seem like wonderful people, the type I would like to have as friends.\n\nAntonio \n\n"},{"_id":"100962463","date":{"$date":"2016-09-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"125656","reviewer_id":"17709879","reviewer_name":"Nora","comments":"We totally loved the apartment, it's cozy and functional, it has everything you need, the location is great, and the decor is lovely.

El baño, tiene una de las mejores duchas con las que me bañe.\nLa locación es excelente. En una parte segura de Copacabana apenas a unas cuadras de la playa entre Avenidas llenas de locales para todas las necesidades (restaurantes, supermercados, bares y más).\nMas allá de todo, creo que lo esencial está en los detalles.

The cons I have about this place was that there was an ironing board, but we couldn't locate or find the iron. The shower didn't have a plastic curtain to prevent the shower from going onto the floor. It usually left a giant puddle right next to the toilet. My fiance and I have slipped almost after every shower (twice a day for the week). Also, bring your own toiletries (including toilet paper). That is not included in this space. It may be located inside of a hotel, but its a private unit so the front desk will not help you out if you need anything. We also had to pay $25 a day for parking (there are ins and outs). For our first time using Airbnb, this was a still a great place to stay. I would love to stay here again!

The separate bedroom has a bed that comes apart into two singles. The building is in a very convenient part of Waikiki, right in the heart of all the action and only a two minute walk to Waikiki Beach and the 'Dukes' statue.  This landmark is a pick up point for all the tourist 'trolleys'.  There's a well stocked supermarket a few minutes walk from the hotel.  The apartment is on the 21st floor on a corner of the building so great views of the beach and the city.  It is a bit noisy with the windows open at night as the noise travels up, but there's lots happening in Waikiki so noise is to be expected.  The one air conditioner in the lounge works well but the cool air doesn't really travel into the bedroom.  There is a pedestal fan in the bedroom though.  The living room has two large windows that open wide, so probably not suitable for young inquisitive children for obvious safety reasons.  Really nice rooftop pool and spa with great views.  Also a laundry on the third floor.  All in all a comfortable, convenient apartment right in the heart of Waikiki and good value for money.  I'd definitely stay there again."},{"_id":"142966383","date":{"$date":"2017-04-09T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12586942","reviewer_id":"98711774","reviewer_name":"Linda","comments":"Great unit with fantastic views of Waikiki Beach .

As long as there's not a long wait for the elevator, it's a 5 minute walk from the room to the beach. There are many restaurants that you can walk to, as well as plenty of shopping. The view is very nice as well! \nThe space was a little tight for 4 adults and luggage, but we were only there 3 nights and rarely in the unit.\nEverything seemed to be pretty clean. My one complaint was that the shower curtain in the bathroom was halfway falling off the hooks. Maybe it's just me but I hate having to touch shower curtains. \nOverall this seemed to be a very good value for the location. Hide also responded very quickly to any questions we had.

The check-in and out was very easy.  Too bad the swimming pool was closed for maintenance at the time.  \n\nThere was one important thing we wish we knew before this trip was the present of jellyfish on the beaches.  If you check (Hidden by Airbnb) for Oahu's Jellyfish calendar, you will find the dates of their likely presence.  We were on the beach on Father's day and saw a group of men with buckets picking up more than 400 jellyfish within an hour.  That was when we learned about it.

It was bright and airy, beautiful and large patio with great views. The location is wonderful as you can walk to everything If I remember correctly it is on the 21st floor which gives you a nice vantage point looking over the city, ocean, and a bit of Diamond Head too. It was nice to have flat screen tv's in both the living area and bedroom.  The check in process was very easy Hide provided all of the information well in advance and was very responsive to messages. \n\nI think the only things that were slightly disappointing was the phone and AC remote batteries were both dead and although we don't care for AC, it would have been really handy if the phone was working as I needed to make calls to book rental cars,  reschedule flights, etc. I am now quite worried at what my cellphone charges might be! With fairness to Hide though, I did not mention this until after we had checked out. \n\nAlso because we had not been to Oahu before, and are fairly new to AirBnB, I was hoping to have a book/binder as some hosts leave so that guests can refer to that for local information, maps, and information regarding the rental suite and how everything operates.  The suite wasn't super stocked so I suggest to pop into the ABC store just down the block to pickup some essentials, I think they are open until 11pm or midnight. \n\nOverall we had a great time and if returning to Waikiki I would want to stay here again for sure!"},{"_id":"278810340","date":{"$date":"2018-06-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12586942","reviewer_id":"14951866","reviewer_name":"Keigo","comments":"景色はものすごく良かったです"},{"_id":"281442444","date":{"$date":"2018-06-24T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12586942","reviewer_id":"71200671","reviewer_name":"Mike","comments":"Location, location, location.

O prédio é antigo mas o apartamento foi bastante reformado. Fica no início da Rua São Salvador, portanto longe do barulho que pode vir da boêmia Praça São Salvador, dois quarteirões adiante, mas suficientemente perto de serviços de todo tipo (banco, mercados, correios, metrô, etc.). Os funcionários do prédio são simpáticos e, quando tivemos uma pequena reclamação de barulho em relação a um vizinho, o porteiro rapidamente resolveu-o, sem sequer ser necessário fazermos contato com a anfitriã a respeito. Só sentimos que uma parte da cozinha não condiz com o restante do apartamento, mas penso que a anfitriã deverá resolver isso em breve. O banho de chuveiro é excelente, os eletrodomésticos da cozinha e a máquina de lavar-secar são novos e muito bons, a iluminação é linda e o ar condicionado no quarto é bastante potente (talvez o suficiente para refrigerar o apartamento inteiro, mas não há como isolar a casa da área de serviço com tanque, que é aberta). Acabamos não conhecendo a Sonia, pois chegamos e saímos em horários inusuais, mas a chegada e a saída foram tranquilas mesmo assim e o contato (por (Hidden by Airbnb) ) correu de forma fluida e sempre que necessário (de ambas partes). Ficaríamos aqui de novo e recomendamos para quem queira um apartamento de quarto e sala confortável numa zona agradável, central e não cara do Rio de Janeiro."},{"_id":"123264438","date":{"$date":"2016-12-28T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12639342","reviewer_id":"8065409","reviewer_name":"Leticia","comments":"Sonia's been an amazing host from beginning to end of my trip to Rio!

Leandro, obrigado pelo tudo, gostaría de voltar sempre!!!\r\nАко има българи, които се чудят къде да нощуват на поносима за стандартите на Рио цена, това е апартаментът на Леандро. Намира се на прекрасно място, съвсем близо има две спирки на метрото (до Копакабана се стига за десетина минути, до Ипанема за 15), както и спирки на градските автобуси. Освен че е на около 15-20 минути пеш от центъра, може да се стигне пеша и до подножието на статуята на Христос (Корковадо), може би за около 50-55 минути нормален ход. Иначе апартаментът отговаря напълно на цената си – с климатик, вентилатор, хладилник, два газови котлона. Аз бях сам, но е идеално и за двойки, леглото е голямо и удобно.

A praia é bem perto, mas não dá pra entrar na água. Fizemos uma caminhada no fim do dia que foi bem agradável, e já conhecemos varios quiosques pra comer/beber depois, tudo pertinho.

Walking distance to The Star, Fish Market and Darling Harbour. The apartment was also very organised and clean. Loved that there was ample sunlight that passed through the apartment. Parking space was a little tight. Recommend to get a smaller car if you intend to rent one. There are certain things to take note, response from host was not very prompt. Asked for late check out several times and only managed to receive a reply after 3 texts and emails. Parking garage was renovating the day I arrived but was not informed earlier and had to pay for parking several hours.

It clearly isn't actually anyone's home and has the clinical, impersonal feel of a hotel. But it's well equipped for a stay in the centre of Sydney and the location is very convenient for Darling Harbour. I never met the named host; I was 'checked in' (their words) by someone else who was clearly in a tearing hurry. Beforehand I was just told I would be met, I didn't know where this would be but I couldn't get into the building and had to wait outside in the street. \r\nThere is no hairdryer or air conditioning (this will make it v hot in the height of summer) and the oven is complicated to work. The design of the building means the apartment overlooks and is overlooked by other apartments and there was some noise at night from neighbours as the units are close together. There is also traffic noise. We were only given one set of keys which was extremely inconvenient. On the plus side the apartment building has a small pool and gym."},{"_id":"112932354","date":{"$date":"2016-11-08T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12655535","reviewer_id":"69519264","reviewer_name":"Giorgio","comments":"Accoglienza buona.posizione ottima.

Top recommendation is to get the ferry from Darling Harbour to Manly \u0026 you get to see the Opera House \u0026 Bridge from the water as well as a great day out!\nMade Comfy - the company that manage this apartment - sorted the Internet within 24hrs when it went down. \nThere is a major issue with this lovely apartment though!  The keys... 1 set provided with fob to enter lobby AND use lift. I didn't think having just one set would be an issue... but, for example, when my husband took our daughter to the swimming pool on the ground floor - I couldn't pop to the shops with the baby because they would need the fob to use the lift \u0026 I would need it to re-enter the building = trapped \u0026 logistics had to be discussed each time we wanted to do something separately.  We also had to pick the keys up from a random letter box several km away as we were arriving late (7.30pm).  Luckily we were hiring a car - not on public transport - so navigated our way around a strange city to 2 addresses... didn't realise this was the situation when I booked. \nI hope that they sort the key situation- they clearly listen to feedback as one of the reviews mentioned needing a fan and there are now 3 in the apartment which was brilliant! \n\n"},{"_id":"136692906","date":{"$date":"2017-03-12T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12655535","reviewer_id":"46108261","reviewer_name":"Pietra","comments":"I booked this place for my parents, aunty and uncle.

As it was our first airbnb experience we were a bit nervous, however it turned out to be a dream holiday. \r\nWe arrived at the flat and were met by Lola (the building guard) who gave us the keys and showed us around the apartment. It was perfect. Clean and tastefully decorated with all the kitchen appliances you could need! \r\nWe chose the apartment for the balcony and views and were blown away. You can see the whole of Barcelona from the balcony, all the way to the sea. Perfect for a sunny evening with a bottle of wine! The best thing about the balcony is that you are not overlooked by anyone. It is completely private and being so high up you are not disturbed by the noise of the road. \r\nThe flat itself is about a 10 minute walk from the metro station Guinardo and it's only a couple of minutes on the metro into town. The metro shuts around midnight so a few late nights we treated ourselves to a taxi back which cost about $11.\r\nLots of little supermarkets nearby to stock up and also several nice bars and cafes if you dont fancy the journey into town. \r\nAll in all was a perfect trip. Fantastic apartment which was great value for money. Would 100% recommend Enriques apartment and will certainly be staying again in the future.

The oven is powerful and great if you plan to cook a nice meal and there is a huge and brand new fridge as well. The neighbourhood is quiet, friendly, away from the hyper-touristic area, although well-connected. \r\nBut the communication with Enrique has only been virtual as we couldn't met him and directly speak to him - only the housekeeper was here to welcome us. The terrace door didn't lock properly, we didn't feel really safe even if the flat is located at the top of the building, so we had to secure it our way.  The kitchen wasn't really clean, the utensils were old.

We really enjoyed our stay and had only a very few remarks, which we forwarded to Kike, who directly responded and ensured to fix them after we pointed them out. As blessed as we were with the weather, so occured the only drawback of our stay- the almost unbearable heat in the apartment during the night, as there is no air condition and only one window, so no air circulation.\r\nAll in all, we really enjoyed the time in Barcelona.

The location is great as well, but watch out for the hill from the station up to the flat! While I would recommend staying here based on the location and views, there are a few things that could be improved. We loved that the flat is spacious and minimal, but we were a little disappointed that there wasn't a blind across the window, which is needed given the strong sunlight in the mornings. One of the plug sockets was left hanging out of the wall with exposed wires, which felt a little unsafe, and there were unsightly burn marks on the kitchen counter. The kitchen is lacking a few essentials such as a kettle, and more pots and pans are needed. We were only in Barcelona for a few days so we ate out, but if you were staying for longer and wanted to cook at the flat, you might have difficulty given the lack of kitchen utensils etc. That said, we had a really great stay, these are just a few minor things that would have made it even better.

However , the front door lock did not function properly which was not thoroughly addressed , thanks to self ingenuity and olive oil , I managed.Unfortunately ,there were several other issues which are completely , unacceptable and placed a damper on my stay .Foremost , the stench from the mold spores growing on the base boards , there are exposed electrical wires from the outlet which is dangling on the kitchen counter , there is also solid ice build up in the freezer making the door to it impossible to close let alone use. The one saving grace of this apt would be the terrace w/views of the city except that the wooden chairs are weathered and rotted w/ torn cushions that create a potential hazard just sitting on them.There is more mold to be found in bathroom around the door casing.

Me and my boyfriend stayed here the last 2 nights of our 7 nights in Barcelona. We had already seen Park Güell and Sagrada Familia before we checked in. This location is really close to both of those. We found that this location was a little too far from Las Ramblas (20 min cab ride, 35 min transit). It is located in a residential area with a lot of families and not a ton of restaurants/bars around. We found ourselves going to El Raval or Las Ramblas area for dinner/drinks and cabbing back up at the end of the night. It ended up costing us more to stay here. Also, the wifi didn't work at all during the 2 nights we were at this location. We contacted Enrique and he said there was an outage within the area. We know that's not his fault but take that into consideration if you need to check in to flights, etc. Hailing a cab the last morning to the airport was not difficult but it was a 40 € cab ride. \nIf you're looking for an incredible view during your stay in a quiet residential area close to Park Güell and Sagrada Familia this is your spot!! \nFor us we spent our time in Barcelona exploring restaurants and bars and this location was the furthest from that and our least favorite because of that. The view is great though and we did sit out on the deck one afternoon.

Perfect for a couple as it's a studio apartment but spacious. Close to metro and other transport links so most attractions are easily accessed. The apartment was spotlessly clean. The views of the city were impressive and the apartment has a great terrace to enjoy. If you are travelling in the summer, be aware that the apartment gets very hot and there is only a fan (no a/c) but this is typical of other accommodation in Cataluna from our experience. The apartment was great value for money and Enrique always replied immediately to emails with helpful information. Overall this apartment has a lot to offer visitors to this great city! :-)"},{"_id":"185584282","date":{"$date":"2017-08-22T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1266425","reviewer_id":"68119868","reviewer_name":"Thomas","comments":"Uncomplicated,Check-In and a phenomenal view over the city.

Дом расположен рядом с автобусной остановкой, откуда можно добраться практически до любой точки города, не используя метро. Важно отметить, Энрике оперативно отвечал на наши сообщения, но в какой-то момент мы поняли, что он не сможет решить всех проблем с квартирой и перестали писать ему . \nВся мебель старая, квартира очень грязная и неуютная! Ремонт делался давно и мебель не менялась, наверное годами! Постель воняет! Нет ни фена (оказывается и не должен был быть), НИ ОДНОЙ ВЕШАЛКИ В ШКАФУ, ни гладильной доски, ни сушилки для белья, ни средства для мытья посуды (принёс на следующий день какой-то парень со словами от Энрике), ни разделочной доски, не было элементарно мыла ‍♂️, про шампунь (оказывается не был включён) и гель для душа я вообще молчу! Шторка в ванной была очень грязная и покрыта плесенью...  \nЕсть микроволновка, ВНИМАНИЕ ☝чистая внутри, но не работает! В ванной некуда даже полотенца повесить (была одна вешалка под полотенце для рук), не горит одна из лампочек, темно, невозможно даже побриться. Крепление для душа отвалилось от стены через 10 минут после того, как мы вошли в квартиру‍♂️! На двух человек предоставили два душевых полотенца и одно крохатное, которым даже руки не вытереть. В квартире просто необходим кондиционер для просушивания и проветривания. Квартира абсолютно непригодна и не готова для жизни. Энрике даже не встретил нас и не смог толком назвать номер квартиры, попав в подъезд, искали у каждой двери файвай (на сайте airbnb был логин и пароль, спасибо!), чтоб определить где наша квартира. На наши претензии по качеству квартиры Энрике ответил, что квартира ни его, прошу обратить на это внимание администрацию сайта.\nУровень безопасности в квартире равен нулю! Входную дверь можно выбить ударом руки (каждый звук, шорох в подъезде слышен в квартире), а балконная дверь террасы не закрывается, (от соседей по террасе стенка отделена стеклянной перегородкой). Полы на террасе не мылись с момента постройки здания. Стулья на террасе были раскиданы, перевёрнуты, и настолько плохо выглядели, что на них небезопасно было садиться и фото мебели с террасы, не соответствуют действительности. По соседству с квартирой находится один из лифтов, шум такой, что кажется будто лифт сейчас въедет в квартиру.\nСтоимость квартиры при бронировании не была низкой, чтоб можно было смириться со всеми этими ужасными недостатками. Я категорически не рекомендую снимать данное жильё даже на одну ночь."},{"_id":"274138498","date":{"$date":"2018-06-08T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1266425","reviewer_id":"129440224","reviewer_name":"Desiree","comments":"We loved staying here - the view (which included the Sagrada Familila)  is really incredible.

For starters, we arrived to check-in at 11:30AM, as prompted by Enrique. When we arrived to the Airbnb there was no one to greet us at the door or open the door for the building for us to retrieve the keys under the mat. I called Enrique and he told me Jocelyn would be arriving in 5 minutes. We did not even know who Jocelyn was or what she looked like. 5 minutes turned into 15 in the hot and humid weather and we decided to go into the building once another tenant had entered. We asked the lady at the desk who was also cleaning where the room was and she led us upstairs. We found the key under that mat and entered the apartment. Once we entered, the place was a disaster. It had not been cleaned at all between the time the previous guests checked-out and we checked-in. Dirty towels laying on the bed, dishes in the sink, hair in the shower, crumbs and trash in the floor. It was gross. A few minutes later there was a knock on the door from people who were coming to clean the place, I am assuming this was Jocelyn. We had to get ready for our day so the only way to get the place cleaned was to have the cleaners come into the space while we showered and got ready. The cleaners should have been called earlier by Enrique to clean before we arrived. Also, we were able to watch the cleaning job that the cleaners did, they did provide new sheets for the bed, they did not provide an new sheet for the couch. The blanket covering the couch was used and the pillows, as well. We never slept under the one sheet that was provided because under it was just the mattress, no fitted sheet. The first night, we went out and came back to the airbnb around 3AM. The key fob was broken and we had absolutely no way of getting in. I called Enrique about 10 times and he never answered the phone once. Considering it we were locked out with no place to stay, or had it been a bigger emergency, he should be readily available to his guests at all times of the day. We had to way for some man to open the parking garage next door who told us that if we hopped a 10 foot fence with spikes at the top, we could get in. And that was our only option. Myself and my friend are both afraid of heights and to throw the spokes at the top in the mix, it was incredibly difficult to get over the fence—not to mention the fence was filthy. We were covered in dust afterwards. I told Enrique this and he prompted me to “try again” as if I didn’t sit outside the building door trying to get the key into the lock..."},{"_id":"301325081","date":{"$date":"2018-08-04T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1266425","reviewer_id":"65026928","reviewer_name":"Raminta","comments":"Location great, ease access to metro station-Alfonso X, which goes straight to the beach (Barcelonetta). \nThere was no air conditioning or a simple fan, and because of that it was really hot even during the night, and hard to sleep as there was no breeze.

The apartment was well equipped with absolutely incredible views from the balcony. The kitchen contains enough utensils to adequately cook for dinner, we we did a few nights, however, we could not get the microwave to work. The apartment was on the top floor of the balcony but the building has two lifts which saves you from climbing the stairs.\n\nThe apartment is located within a short five to ten minute walk from the supermarket and the metro. The only downside is that it is very uphill on the walk back. The metro is easy to navigate and will take you anywhere as well as the Sagrada Família only being a twenty minute walk away from the apartment itself.\n\nEnrique was an excellent host, replying to any messages very quickly. The place was very clean when we arrived and was an absolute steal for the price. The only downsides to the apartment is the lack of air conditioning or fan which means it gets very hot at night and hard to sleep. The back door to the balcony doesn't lock very well (it can be opened if you pull on it hard) but as it's located on the seventh floor it's not the greatest concern.\n\nOverall, we would highly reccomend Enriques place and we would definitely stay there again!"},{"_id":"320130411","date":{"$date":"2018-09-08T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1266425","reviewer_id":"27986696","reviewer_name":"Dagmar","comments":"Wir waren mit der Abwicklung von Airbnb sehr zufrieden."},{"_id":"323309257","date":{"$date":"2018-09-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1266425","reviewer_id":"174389427","reviewer_name":"James","comments":"Enrique's apartment is a really good choice for an affordable stay in Barcelona.

Le micro-ondes et la haute ne fonctionnaient pas. Au niveau de la salle de bain, il manquait un tapis de sol et l'eau de la douche coulait par terre. Le sol était donc en permanence mouillé. Un rideaux à la fenêtre du salon aurait été un plus également.\nCependant, il y a aussi des bons côtés: le logement est bien situé, proche de la station de métro et une belle vue sur la Sagrada Familia.

Die Küche ist gut ausgestattet und wir hatten keine Probleme mit dem Herd (nicht wie in manchen Bewertungen zuvor beschrieben). Den Aufzug nebenan hört man tagsüber etwas, aber nachts fährt niemand damit und man kann wunderbar schlafen. Das Highlight der Wohnung ist natürlich die Dachterrasse auf der wir viel Zeit verbracht haben. Der Ausblick ist einfach großartig und man sieht über ganz Barcelona. Das WLAN funktionierte einwandfrei. Auch die Lage ist perfekt um die Stadt zu erkunden. Bis zur U-Bahn-Station sind es nur wenige Gehminuten und mit der U-Bahn ist man sehr schnell an den Hotspots der Stadt oder am Strand (ca. 10-12 Minuten).\nWir können diese Wohnung wirklich weiter empfehlen und würden wieder kommen, wenn wir noch einmal in Barcelona sind."},{"_id":"407885623","date":{"$date":"2019-02-03T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1266425","reviewer_id":"69741006","reviewer_name":"Fanny","comments":"Great place to explore Barcelona (central) and the terrasse is just extra to chill after a long day of walking through the city.

The complex is absolutely stunning with beautiful well maintained grounds and the pool area and views were absolutely gorgeous. The apartment was clean, well equipped and comfortable.  The only downside was that the bedroom is near the front of the unit and the traffic noise was quite loud, making it difficult to fall asleep. This is probably due to the fact the one of the window fixture in the bedroom is an open blind, offering great air flow but not much in noise reduction. However, this probably wouldn't bother a heavy sleeper or could be easily be minisimed with earplugs. On the whole we would definitely recommend!

This is our first AirB\u0026B rental and we were pleasantly surprised! The views of the ocean were amazing, the resort is well kept and the landscaping is beautiful. Turtles were in the ocean at the edge of the property every morning, and we were usually able to scurry down with coffee or a mimosa and watch them swim and come up for air. The pool was rarely, if ever, used during our stay, so you could have it all to yourself. The BBQ are was clean and well-kept. This condo is on the third floor with stairs up, so if you have physical limitations it might be a struggle. However, the third floor placement allows for extremely quieter accommodations and an unparrelleled view of the ocean. The bedroom is on the street side, so road noise does creep in during the evenings. We easily slept and the noise didn't bother us at all. The fans and open windows kept us cool during the evenings with no need for AC (this unit does not have it). Although we didn't meet Ken in person, he provided us with all the information we needed to enjoy the condo without worry. This place is well stocked, clean and convenient. Highly recommended."},{"_id":"128681521","date":{"$date":"2017-01-26T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12713962","reviewer_id":"6681633","reviewer_name":"Deirdre","comments":"I was struck upon entering the condo by the immediately visible beautiful view of the Pacific from the lanai. That alone would have made staying here worth it, but on top of that, Keneke has stocked the condo chock-full of kitchen supplies and extra beach towels. Two advisories: the condo is on the small side for more than two people, although it can technically sleep four (two in the real bed and two on the pullout couch), and careful with parking here because other guests and owners can get a bit possessive, especially if they have large cars. Also, you definitely should have a car if you stay here because while a few markets/delis and shops are walkable, the town of Lahaina is not.

Wonderful view, perfect size, quiet location. We moved to a second condo the second week and I don’t think it even compares to Ken’s. The bench right by the water/rocks to drink morning coffee on makes it worth it all by itself! And for anyone concerned abt the third floor walk up, don’t be. The condos are set up so that anyone coming up the stairs goes right by your front door, so if you have regular door open and just screen door closed they can see right inside. Being on the top floor makes that not an issue. Nobody was next to us either so nobody came by our door the entire week! Made it even more quiet and could also be viewed as an additional safety measure, since there was no reason for anyone but us to be on third floor. The whole week was perfect. Would definitely stay here again. Thank you, Ken!"}]}

It was the first time for me to stay in an air bnb. Although I was quite confident from their profile before my arrival, the quality of my stay was even beyond my high expectations. Aurora and Alberto confirmed they are the ideal hosts, and their house and garden were the ideal place to stay. I arrived with an empty stomach, and Aurora took me to one of the neighborhood restaurants and explained the menu in English (6 Euros for everything). After lunch, Alberto showed me all flowers and trees in the garden and later he had set up the hammock between the trees. I relaxed myself in the peaceful atmosphere with birds chirping among the fragrant orange and jasmine blossoms. During the stay, my friend, Emma and I received more than what we needed: beautifully decorated room and bathroom, delicious daily breakfast (sometimes in their lovely garden), good recommendations for restaurants and 1 day trips to nearby towns (they had prepared to give us all the information we need before we arrived). They learned my precise breakfast request in one day and prepared perfectly for the rest of my 11 day-stay. Also we enjoyed their yoga classes in the studio which is located in the basement with the window opening out to the garden. They sometimes offered me the fresh vegetable-and-fruit juice and yummy soup (They are vegetarians). On Sunday, when they have no classes, they offered us to drive around town. The highlight of the tour was the museum which also has a huge garden. Alberto knows all the flowers and plants, and has a lot of stories about almost everything. I shared their tastes and felt they were my friends for years. I totally recommend this place and will come back in the near future for a longer stay.

When I first got there, I met Aurora. She showed me my room (which was beautiful btw - the bed is huge and there's an entire closet for you to put your clothes, if you want), showed the bathroom, gave me the house key and a few suggestions of places to eat/to visit. They live some 15 minutes by foot from the center of Porto (and from there you can see places like the Ribeira, th D. Luis I Bridge, etc.), which is pretty neat. The next two mornings, they served us (there were two other guests from France) a nice breakfast, including coffee, bread, cheese, and a fruit. One of the nicest things Aurora did was lend me $5 when I had trouble paying with my credit card at this one sweets shop that is nearby (BRING CASH TO PORTO! this way you can eat at the cheap but good places!); she was okay with me paying her back once I was able to get money out. \r\nIf you want a nice and safe place to stay in Porto, with loving and welcoming hosts, please choose Aurora and Alberto. They have so far been my favorite hosts (not that the others were bad - they just went above and beyond!) and I would definitely stay with them again if I went back to Porto.\r\n\r\nPortuguês:\r\nAdorei ficar na casa da Aurora e do Alberto! Tive uma recepção muito calorosa da Aurora na manhã da minha chegada. Ela me mostrou tudo o que eu precisava - o meu quarto, a cozinha, o banheiro, lugares para visitar, etc. Também me deu dicas de onde eu poderia almoçar/jantar a um preço baixo.\r\nA casa deles é beeeeeeem próxima ao centro de Porto, então não compre o cartão de viagem turístico que é vendido no aeroporto (a não ser que você esteja planejando ir para lugares como Matosinhos, que fica fora da zona de onde Aurora e Alberto moram e a passagem é mais cara). Além disso, com coisa de $6,  $7 euros, você pode jantar um prato feito e comer altos docinhos em uma das confeitarias/restaurantes perto da casa deles.\r\nEu recomendo a casa da Aurora e do Alberto para qualquer um que queira uma localização segura, perto do centro de Porto e com hospedeiros calorosos e gentis."},{"_id":"33234438","date":{"$date":"2015-05-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"127208","reviewer_id":"20392656","reviewer_name":"Christophe","comments":"Excellent séjour, on a adoré prendre le petit déjeuner dans le jardin et les précieux conseils de nos hôtes sur leur ville."},{"_id":"33518636","date":{"$date":"2015-05-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"127208","reviewer_id":"13093848","reviewer_name":"Marie-Christine","comments":"We enjoyed our stay at Auroras and Albertos place very much.

I had a great sleep :) The next day I was served a nice breakfast in the lovely garden and when I was ready to head into town, Alberto equipped me with a map and good advice. The house is a good 15 minute walk from the center. You can hop on a bus if you are to tired to walk back. The house is two floors and big enough for you to be private if that is what you prefer. I was happy to engage with Aurora and Alberto since I was traveling alone, but my impression is that you be as private as you wish. My trip onwards was by bus and Alberto drove me to the bus terminal which was a big help. Actually it felt like staying with family.

Ich habe mich bei den beiden sehr wohl gefühlt. Das Zimmer hat alles, was man benötigt, das Bett fand ich sehr bequem. Die Einrichtung hat mir sehr gut gefallen. In der Zeit als ich da war, hatte ich das wunderschöne Bad ganz für mich alleine. Das Frühstück war lecker, vor allem die selbstgemachte Marmelade war toll. Es gibt super Tipps für Unternehmungen und Touren durch die Stadt, die einen auch mal in weniger touristische Gegenden der Stadt bringen. Das fand ich besonders toll. Die angegebenen 15 Minuten ins Zentrum führen einen dann aber erst an den Rand des Zentrums. Vom Douro sind es eher 30-45 Minuten, je nachdem, wie schnell man unterwegs ist und welchen Weg man nimmt. Busse und Metro fahren aber regelmäßig und bieten eine gute Alternative, wenn man dann doch mal keine Lust hat zu laufen. Insgesamt bietet diese Unterkunft alles, was man sich wünschen kann. Gerade die Gastgeber machen den Aufenthalt zu etwas besonderem. Die Lage der Unterkunft ist sehr ruhig. Danke nochmals für einen rundum wundervollen Aufenthalt!"},{"_id":"242797347","date":{"$date":"2018-03-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"127208","reviewer_id":"110471028","reviewer_name":"Pierre","comments":"Aurora et Alberto sont d'une grande gentillesse et ils sont toujours prêts à donner conseils et bonnes adresses ou à vous aider pour tout.

My friend and I enjoyed a relaxing moment there one afternoon.  The house was super clean, bed was comfortable, the private washroom was huge, spacious and clean. Breakfast was so good with homemade jams from their own garden.  The hosts were very generous enough to share with us the fruits from their own trees.  Plums were so sweet. (Small gestures mean a lot.)  They even came with us and introduced us to a friendly cafe nearby where we always had our \"tosta mista con cafe\".  They definitely know what places to see in Porto and they gave us proper instructions/directions and advice. Some extras:  if you are into yoga and meditation, you are welcome to join.  The host can give you a good massage for a very, very reasonable rate.  It is easy to see why they became a superhost.

The bedroom looks a little plain but is perfect for its use, mattresses are hard and pillows thin but the covers are cosy, everything was clean.

Overall, our experience was satisfactory, except for the fact we missed air conditioning in the very hot weather. The flat was as described, well maintained, orderly and clean including the bathrooms. However, it was quite a distance from the centre and even the local taxi driver had difficulty locating the flat. \r\nOur host, Thompson had readily agreed for earlier check in. His agent was Abilio; and although he didn’t converse with us in English, his friend (Paulo?) spoke fluently.  On entering the house we were told the house rules, including repeated instructions NOT to touch the walls, which we all felt were quite unnecessary and frankly, rather unwelcoming . We were also instructed not to smoke inside, and despite interrupting to explain that none of us were smokers, our host insisted on continuing his spiel.\r\nAdmittedly I had not done my homework well and was disappointed to discover there was no wifi (although this and the fact of no AC is mentioned on the website) which made communication and enquiries difficult as we normally depend on UBER taxi service. The nearest public transport was some distance, but this was not an option as we were travelling with our 2 year old grandson accompanying us.  The neighbourhood was tidy and quiet but rather remote from the touristy areas, and probably best suited to a big group of music festival-goers who want to stay together in a large flat. In this context, the flat would prove relatively good value for money. \r\nI had mentioned to Thompson that we were travelling with a young child, however the flat was far from child-friendly – we had our work cut out to stop our curious toddler from playing with the numerous trinkets and decorations in the apartment. It wasn’t just the child, I myself accidentally knocked down some photographs from a shelf in the hallway trying to find the bathroom light switch in the dark. I might have caused some damage to the frames for which I apologise. If this is the case, I will pay for new replacement frames.\r\nIn summary this flat is spacious, clean and cheap but has several shortcomings as highlighted above.

Maria Eulalia is so kind and offered great advice on sights and is a lovely person as well. She had another guest checking in the day I was leaving and was nice enough to offer luggage storage space since my flight was late in the afternoon."},{"_id":"251159549","date":{"$date":"2018-04-07T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12758910","reviewer_id":"89870242","reviewer_name":"Olli","comments":"Die Lage ist perfekt und Maria ist ein \"Juwel\"! \nEs ist ein Zimmer mit Balkon auf dem 4.Stock.

There is also a bus stop and a metro stop right by her place, so it’s very easy to get around to other places in the city. The room itself was clean and worked perfectly for my friend and I. The beds were comfortable and the direct access to the balcony was by far our favorite thing about the room.

Eine klare Empfehlung an alle, die mit einer Gruppe im Zentrum von Porto übernachten wollen.  Wir haben fast alle unsere Ziele zu Fuß erreicht, nur zum Strand haben wir den Bus genommen (ca. 15min Fahrt).  Unsere Gruppe hat sicher sehr wohl gefühlt und wir würden jederzeit wieder buchen. Wir wurden sehr herzlich empfangen und auch bei Fragen während unseres Aufenthalts war unsere Ansprechpartnerin immer zur Stelle.

The apartment itself was also just what we wanted and needed—clean, cozy, quiet, modern and with most everything we needed.  Keep in mind when booking that parking is not included and will run you about $20 a day.  Andy made self check-in very straight forward.  We gave it four instead of five stars because there were signs in the lobby saying that Airbnb was forbidden, and we worried about being kicked out.  We never had a problem though.  If they had been granted an exception, it would have been helpful to know that."}]}

I was late checking in because I got lost and then there was an accident 10 miles  from her on the twisty and dark  one lane \"highway\" that required a pretty treacherous work-around which was even more steep, twisty, dark and rainy. The street they are on is also all those things, which is to say, arrive during the day if you possibly can! But Velma was very accommodating and communicative and welcoming once I finally arrived (and stayed such with any questions that came up while there, also.) It's remote, but once you see the view and have such a relaxing place to be it will be worth it. Spent most of the day recuperating there and it was very enjoyable. Coffee and muffins were great! Do bring food. Da poke shack isn't far and has great poke, keokis is also sweet, but hours vary, so make sure you have stuff to eat and the kitchen has everything you'll need (except an oven or range).  Wifi was only strong in a few places in the room, so don't expect to stream. I'd recommend this place as a checkpoint going the southern route from side to side, get there before dark and watch the amazing sunset.

It was extremely hard to find without any lights in the front or the house number illuminated.  Luckily the host Jeremy gave us his number and we were able to communicate with him on finding the place. It would have been nice beforehand  to find it though and also where to park.\nIf you not used to driving extremely steep and winding roads, I would advise.

The small outdoor kitchen was great and has what you need for small fpor preparation. The home is on rainwater catchment and energy efficient water heating so if you are looking for long showers this wouldn't be a first pick for you, for us it wasn't a big deal, we are all for energy conservation and we didn't come to the island to spend time in the shower anyway. :) They were able to accommodate us on late short notice and that was very very much appreciated. The pillows smelled kind of odd but probably due to the combo of humidity and heat they get here. Overall we very much enjoyed our stay here and would recommend and revisit.

My only regret is that we didn’t stay more nights.  If you are expecting a high-end, spotless hotel with matching towels, you might want to look elsewhere. However, if you are looking for a comfortable abode at a great price with a fantastic view and amazing hosts, look no further!\n\nPrevious reviews aren’t kidding about that view; it’s killer. And the best part is you get the panorama from the entire room - the windows are amazing. As we were checking in, I mentioned that I wished we had stopped and picked up a beer, to sit on the deck and enjoy the sunset with. Three minutes later our host came down with a 6-pack of IPA’s (my husband’s favorite), explaining that a local brewery had given them to him and he wasn’t keen on IPA’s. Ahhh, what a great way to unwind after 24 hours of travel. We then went to sleep with the doors wide open (to the screened-in porch), listening to the sound of the ocean.  \n\nI WOULD recommend picking up some food and ground coffee before heading to Velma’s. While the location is central to the island, it is not close to groceries or other similar amenities. There is a coffee maker (yes!!) in the outdoor kitchen.\n\nMahalo, and Mele Kalikimaka!"},{"_id":"219144142","date":{"$date":"2017-12-16T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12797051","reviewer_id":"38766150","reviewer_name":"Esteban","comments":"We only stayed one day at Velma's place (wish it was longer!) but it was really nice, clean and very comfortable.

There's also an unscreened lanai, which provided an unobstructed view of the ocean (except for a few power lines, although those were easy to ignore). We loved having both options.\n\nVelma's son Don greeted us and showed us the ins and outs of the place, which includes an outdoor kitchen sufficient for some simple cooking, and complimentary muffins for each guest, bottled water, and freshly ground Kona coffee for the morning. We didn't end up using the kitchen, but we appreciated having the fridge to store beverages.

There are blinds in every window that needs privacy but the big picture window didn’t have a blind so you’ll wake up with the morning light to incredible unobstructed views.  The cooking facilities were basic but we had everything that we needed and Velma’s son Donnie had set us up with a muffin, juice and water each which was so thoughtful.

Space was good for me as Asian. We could hear noises from the street and other room but we are okay as we are not light sleepers. We need to share hair dryer with other guests. Thanks to the staff who helped to empty trash bin daily and I liked the firm bed very much as I could rest really well after walking all day long."}]}

The men came back multiple times throughout the night, while I barricaded myself in my bedroom pretending to not exist while Steve was using a power drill to either make something or put boards over his window for protection. The police may have come throughout the night, I couldn't tell. I eventually snuck out at 5am once everything had calmed down and stayed on the beach the rest of the morning.

He is easy to talk to, gives great tips about the local area, and in general has great communication; he does his best to make himself available to us,  and made that clear as well. The place is walking distance to the Ala Moana center outdoor mall,  Ala Moana beach park,  and Magic Island (I love to watch the sunset there,  and parking there is free!!). He also feeds the cats that lives in the streets,  they are all adorable.. He runs a moped rental business,  so there are many bikes and parts and moped stuff there basically. Note that if you get a rental car, there is a $10 per night charge for the car, much cheaper than every other place that offers overnight parking. The washer requires $1.50 in quarters to be operated,  dryer is free; Steve showed us how to use both of them. The AC in the room is a life saver. The fridge in the room is super cold, which is awesome. Some of the water placed up on the top shelf had some ice in it which was nice. It's a small, carpeted place (no shoes in the house! I liked that) and is for people on a tight budget. It will probably do you well to bring ear plugs, which I always do wherever I go. Note also there is another room that perhaps he is renting out,  so you may have some company besides Steve himself.

It's an even shorter walk though, to the Foodland at Ala Moana shopping centre. And trust me, if there is any place your gonna want to be, it's at the Foodland. I'm talking fresh Poke bowls, Chicken drumsticks, in house baked donuts, Sushi and there is even a bar there if your feeling a little thirsty from your travels.\r\n\r\nIf you want to see a little bit more than whats just around within walking distance. You can hire a moped or a scooter from Steve.

I was nervous upon arrival for a few reasons: lack of communication, and the surprise two other (male) residents. Steve answered my question when I booked, more than a month before the trip. However, when I tried to confirm a week before and ask about parking, I received no response. I decided to risk it and keep the booking because it was so conveniently located to my conference. I also received no response when I texted upon arrival at the airport. Check-in turned out to be fine, because the other residents were there, but it would have been nice, and normal, to have had communication with the host. The other residents were nice and helpful, but at first I was nervous about the surprise of staying with three men. It was pretty clean inside, even if the appearance outside would lead you to think otherwise. The room was fine with clean linens and towels, and the A/C was nice to have. There is a lock on the bedroom door, and there is a key so you can lock when you leave. I lost some sleep on the first night because there is a club just across the street, and a parking lot just outside the bedroom window. Bring ear plugs. \n\nSome other positives: very good price for Honolulu, 10-15 minute walk to the Ala Moana Beach Park (less crowded than Waikiki, which is a few miles away). Bus stops nearby. 5 minute walk to the Ala Moana hotel, where I picked up airport/tour shuttles. Residents were nice and helpful once there. \n\nBut, communication!

Im Rest der Wohnung war es etwas durcheinander und unordentlich, aber nicht dreckig oder eklig. \nWir haben die Unterkunft nur gebucht, weil in der Beschreibung eine Waschmaschine im Gebäude angegeben war und wir auf unserer 9-wöchigen USA-Rundreise unsere Wäsche hin und wieder mal waschen müssen. Aber die Beschreibung der Ausstattung war nicht korrekt, es war keine Möglichkeit zum Waschen da, auch nicht gegen eine Gebühr. Wir haben unsere Wäsche in einem Laundromat waschen müssen....\nDas Haus war in einer kleinen Seitenstraße mit einigen Obdachlosen und Nachtclubs. Sketchy neighborhood, würde man im amerikanischen sagen. Dafür war die Lage super zentral, ziemlich genau zwischen Downtown und Waikiki.\nGeparkt haben wir an der Hauptstraße mit „metered parking“, in der kleinen Seitenstraße gab es nur begrenzt Parkmöglichkeiten, insgesamt ca 6 öffentliche Parkplätze.\nLeider haben wir Steve persönlich nicht getroffen und von ihm keine Informationen oder Rückmeldung zum Check-In bekommen. Erst nach unserem Anruf kurz bevor wir ankamen. Yasuko, der Mitbewohner, war bei unserer Ankunft da und hat uns sehr freundlich empfangen und war sehr hilfsbereit.

But, I am Not a night owl and would never stay out late partying and walk back alone.

I walked to the Hawaii Art Museum three times- great exercise and a fun place to hang out, have a wonderful lunch, take tours to Shangri-La, etc. \nI never used the kitchen to cook. It was so easy to go to the food court at Ala Moana or ??? so many options. \nSteve's place is definitely nothing fancy—bunk beds (I rented the room for myself) but, there is a little refrigerator, TV, Wifi.

The location is on a street that still has original residences, with the surroundings having been taken over by services and buildings catering to a convention/tourist crowd.  The street is a bit run down....and on first glance sketchy.  BUT...the area was safe and within one block to bus directly into Waikiki.   The other direction, few blocks is high end shopping with bus to other venues including airport.  And location is three blocks from Don Quiote where one can buy food and anything else needed.  The room, bathroom and kitchen were very clean.  Other areas...clean but cluttered, but presenting no concern.   I am not a cat person and the cats were not expecting any petting or interaction so that worked out fine.

The entire place wasn’t anything like described. Steve gave me a “special offer” of 3 beds in a private room, that were not listed on Airbnb, which I paid more for. When I walked in, the kitchen had stains everywhere: on the fridge, counter tops, sink, and more. When I reached to turn on the light, I saw a huge ant colony. I get that Hawaii is hot and there could be insects. But ants don’t come out for nothing, they come out when there’s food laying around uncleaned. I was obviously frustrated and tried to call Steve to ask what I should do. But he never answered... I decided to walk in to take a look at the bedroom but my promised “private” room was not private at all. It was a shared room with multiple other guests. The entire room reeked of sweat and other odors. The entire place looked like it hadn’t been cleaned in years. I kindly asked for my money back but Steve told me to stop being childish and to stop texting him. I spent $50 on Uber to get there and $100 for the place. I am not an unreasonable person but this is so unfair. Nothing was as described so the decent thing Steve could do is to refund my money."},{"_id":"366570060","date":{"$date":"2019-01-02T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12810796","reviewer_id":"157388470","reviewer_name":"Anthony","comments":"Convenient location and dorm style.

The unit we rented, the \"Retreat\", was in the middle of the other two units, on the ground floor of the main house. Now, if you place privacy at a premium this is definitely not recommended as a place to stay. The major issue we had is that the other guests (if there were any) would be forced to walk right past you, onto your Lanai (porch) as there is no other path and look right into the unit with its large windows. There is a screen on the lanai (sort of) being shared by the three units but it is not private at all. The curtains also don’t close completely. When we asked the host if it would be possible to move to the unit at the end, because this was definitely not as advertised, his first response was that this would not be possible as other people would be arriving the following day. He then said we could, but at an additional cleaning fee. He also said we were renting the cheapest unit. We went onto the Airbnb site and found the other units, which are both advertised completely separately, but with the same description under different names and they were exactly the same price. In addition, he also replied that \"they try to make it apparent on their Airbnb page that there are three units adjacent to each other” - but good luck in finding this description anywhere. \r\n \r\nOn the positive side, the rooms were large and clean and we were woken up by birdsong in the mornings. \r\n"},{"_id":"102300976","date":{"$date":"2016-09-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12812425","reviewer_id":"51045610","reviewer_name":"Ellie","comments":"We really enjoyed our stay here.

Our host, Jeremy was very warm and welcoming. He greeted us upon arrival and was always responsive when needed. He gave us a lot of information on things to do in the area. Most of our communication was via email, which was fine for us. He also checked in with us to make sure we had everything we needed. \nThe unit was clean, nicely put together and very spacious. Good quality appliances, Full kitchen w/microwave and fridge. Pots, pans, cooking utensils, etc. Enough room for two people and possibly a third.  It was nice and a major plus having washer/dryer access a few step outside of the unit.  Bath and beach towels as well as shampoo and bath wash was there for our use.\nThe bed was firm. Im not sure it was a queen. Maybe a little smaller but we both slept comfortably every night. A couch and flat screen tv w/hdmi hook up in the bedroom. No A/C but we were very comfortable using the ceiling fans and plug in fan w/window open.  The wifi worked fine. This is also a gated property so we felt safe at night. \nOur unit was in the middle of two others. Great view of the mountains. To enter and leave the units you will need to cross through the neighbors lanai.  We were aware of this in advance and wasn't bothered since we were out most of the day. Just something to consider if you are looking to sit outside in privacy. Loved being greeted by the dogs. They were very well behaved and sweet as pie.  The toads come out at night. I was tickled seeing them hoping around the property when we came back from our adventures. I enjoyed hearing roosters some mornings in the far distance or the beautiful birds singing.  A couple of little lizards here and there but it's to be expected. \nThis is a great side of town to visit. Plenty of things to keep you busy during the day and then having a quiet place to come back and rest. It's a good idea to rent a car. We drove all up and down the coast. It is very amazing and the views are simply breathtaking! Make sure to try the cooked snacks at the corner store and try the sno puffs at the bakery up the street. \nYou will not be disappointed staying here. We would definitely come back again. :-)"},{"_id":"110505728","date":{"$date":"2016-10-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12812425","reviewer_id":"17831612","reviewer_name":"Christopher","comments":"This place was a fantastic getaway on the north shore.

Absolutely blissful, quiet spot. There are neighboring AirBnB guests on either side of you, but we barely saw them while we were at the unit. The host was kind and communicative, but was mostly invisible and out of the way. The bed was comfortable and the unit itself was well-built from high-quality materials. It's a nice place to stay!\r\n\r\nThe internet is fast – sometimes. I was trying to participate in a work video conference while there (I know, it was a bad way to spend time on Oahu), and the connection sporadically bounced between super fast and almost nonexistent. It could be the local service provider, it could be the distance that the network repeater is from the main unit, or it could be heavy use by others on the network, but it was a problem since the unit is also in an area with poor AT\u0026T coverage so I couldn't use my phone to connect, either.\r\n\r\nRegardless, if you're staying here for a few nights, I hope you don't have to spend much time on the computer. There's too much nearby to enjoy!

Very hard to find the front gate and the actual unit once on the property as there are very few lights outdoors so we were in the pitch black.\n-Due to the property location being next to an open countryside view it lends itself to a lot of bugs mostly outside of the unit (This didn't bother me too much since they are a part of life but when you walk in and out this was a bit of a distraction)\n"},{"_id":"285112481","date":{"$date":"2018-07-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12812425","reviewer_id":"116405090","reviewer_name":"Miguel","comments":"Love the place.

The outdoor shower was exciting- fun to be outside in the elements.  The views from the room are fabulous- during the day you can see the gorgeous Ohi’a forests and the ocean in the distance, and at night the star-gazing is amazing.  The power did go out twice when we were there, but something we were expecting from the off-grid style home.  It’s very dark in this neighborhood so be careful when driving at night.

It’s like you and nature are one at this indoor/outdoor, quiet, secluded, eclectic little place. \n\nThere are lots of things to look and and the artistic style is very funky— in a good way. If you are into seeing how creatively people can build a home from a mix of standard and non-standard materials, you’ll be as excited about this place as I was. \n\nIn the daylight, the beauty was breathtaking. You feel like you are in your own succulent garden. \n\nWe were provided with the most well stocked fridge and pantry we have ever seen at an Airbnb. Fresh eggs, jelly, cream cheese, butter, bagels, sparkling cider, English muffins, water, pantry full of stuff! \n\nThere are lots of tips and suggestions of things to do in the area. Mostly, we just sat and enjoyed the view and the surroundings before we headed out. \n\nOh and there are chickens and snuggly cats. So if you are missing your critter cuddles (like I always am), one of the lovely cats will show you some love if you want. But they stayed to their own area so if you didn’t want to see cats, you might never know they were there. \n\nThe place has to be your style. If you are looking for a motel room, keep looking.

Its ideal location in North Kihei is close to restaurants, many beaches, and interesting activities. From your lanai, you will see an ancient Hawaiian fish pond where green sea turtles sometimes come to bask; there is a quiet, shaded park, the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary (the only sanctuary dedicated to to humpback whales), and an awesome Indian restaurant right on the ocean. Located near the beginning of the longest uninterrupted white sand beach in the whole state, you can run (or walk) from our unit all the way (six miles -in front of Kihei Canoe Club, Maui Canoe Club and a few condos to the protected area along the Kealia Pond National Wildlife Refuge and board walk) to Maalaea Harbor (with the excellent Maui Ocean Center, Maui Golf \u0026 Sports park for the kids, many restaurants, Pacific Whale Foundation - and a bus stop to deliver you back in front of Kihei Bay Surf. Our complex has a good swimming pool, hot jacuzzi, tennis courts, BBQ area, and clean laundry facilities. \r\n\r\nOur corner unit is bigger and has more light than most of the other units in our complex. The wrap-around lanai offers more space than the other units as well. It has a queen bed and a sofa couch for sleeping. The unit has been renovated and upgraded several times since my mom first lived there when she arrived on Maui from Chicago in 1985 to teach English at Maui College. She loved her job and Kihei -- and she met a nice, handsome counsellor working at the college. They got married - and had me. \r\n\r\nAnd I just got married in August to my beautiful bride, who has a 8-year-old son. We feel very blessed. And we hope to share our love of place with you. \r\n\r\nAt KBS, you will be close to Kihei Canoe Club, where both my mom and I have done competitive outrigger canoe paddling. You can experience being out on the water if you go to the KCC Visitor Paddle on Tuesday or Thursday morning. Get there by 7:15 am to make sure you get a spot. During the winter, you may see whales while you are on the water. Allow a couple of hours for the experience. My mom is a volunteer for the HIHWNMS - the free museum and whale sanctuary across the street. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, you can hear a free lecture from 11am until noon about the Humpback Whales. The museum is open from 10am-3pm, Monday-Friday, and on the last Saturday of the month from 10am-1pm. The mission is to educate the public and protect humpback whales and other marine life and our environment. \r\n\r\nAnother activity that is nearby is Hawaiian singing, ukulele, and hula on Thursday nights from 7-8:30 pm. at the Keolahou Church, 177 S. Kihei Rd. It is joyful - and a glimpse of Hawaiian culture. \r\n\r\nCome stay. We think you will have a wonderful time.","host_response_time":"within a few hours","host_thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/dd7e54bd-d72e-4186-a91d-e860ad97eb11.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","host_picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/dd7e54bd-d72e-4186-a91d-e860ad97eb11.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","host_neighbourhood":"Kihei/Wailea","host_response_rate":91,"host_is_superhost":false,"host_has_profile_pic":true,"host_identity_verified":false,"host_listings_count":1,"host_total_listings_count":1,"host_verifications":["phone","reviews","jumio","offline_government_id","selfie","government_id","identity_manual"]},"address":{"street":"Kihei, HI, United States","suburb":"Kihei/Wailea","government_area":"Kihei-Makena","market":"Maui","country":"United States","country_code":"US","location":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-156.4587,20.76445],"is_location_exact":true}},"availability":{"availability_30":9,"availability_60":39,"availability_90":69,"availability_365":329},"review_scores":{"review_scores_accuracy":10,"review_scores_cleanliness":9,"review_scores_checkin":10,"review_scores_communication":10,"review_scores_location":10,"review_scores_value":9,"review_scores_rating":93},"reviews":[{"_id":"73014993","date":{"$date":"2016-05-06T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12815927","reviewer_id":"66085922","reviewer_name":"Costa","comments":"Excellent place with all the facilities as described in the ad.

We felt the location was awesome, fairly central to the rest of the island and Kihei was so relaxed it was perfect. The condo has everything you could need and we especially liked that there was Tupperware so we could pack our own lunches and snacks. There were also two sets of snorkel gear which was great since we left one of ours at home accidentally. The beach towels were great too since they take up room when you bring your own. We enjoyed spending time by the pool and right across the road is a great park with a perfect swimming spot for kids. On our last day we had a late flight out and asked if we could stay a bit later so we could shower after the beach and John was very accommodating. We really had a great last day knowing we still had a home base for us and our stuff, it was greatly appreciated.  We would definitely come back!"},{"_id":"88452439","date":{"$date":"2016-07-24T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12815927","reviewer_id":"58578116","reviewer_name":"Moritz","comments":"perfect stay !"},{"_id":"89239425","date":{"$date":"2016-07-27T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12815927","reviewer_id":"82148499","reviewer_name":"Kourtney","comments":"John was very nice, we live on island and would defiantly stay again there again for a quick getaway!"},{"_id":"90561557","date":{"$date":"2016-08-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12815927","reviewer_id":"72350493","reviewer_name":"Andrea","comments":"Thanks for everything.

It's spacious (twice as big as the neighbouring condos!), clean, fresh and airy! A wrap around balcony which is perfect for a glass of wine at sunset! Ideal for drying clothes also! Screen doors back and front meant a breeze could run through the apartment. \nSwimming pool was really clean as was the hot tub and well looked after by the on site manager, Mark. The pool wasn't that busy so we felt like it was our own private pool on several occasions! There was a barbeque area beside the pool which was great to use on those evenings we didn't feel like going out for dinner! A laundry room was also situated beside the tennis courts. \nThe location on Kihei was great, we had a beach right across the road that we could see from our balcony. No matter where you're  staying in Maui a car would definitely be necessary. John recommended Kihei car rental which turned out to be a fraction of the cost of an airport rental! A shuttle bus runs to the airport also from there. \nMonsoon Indian(restaurant)for any Indian lovers is directly across the road and was recommended by Johns dad to try it out, it was so good we went there twice! \nSnorkelers- there are so many great snorkelling beaches within a ten minute drive(by car)! \nMolokini + Turtle town-definitely a must!! \nThe Road to Hana- beautiful scenery and waterfalls I would advise camping along the route as there is so much to see in just one day!! The road is quite windy and narrow! \nDefinitely go to Hookipa beach near Paia if you want to see turtles basking around 17.00hrs! \nWe can't wait to visit Maui again next year and were hoping John will have a free space for us in his condo!! I can't thank John and family enough for their hospitality :) "},{"_id":"96620324","date":{"$date":"2016-08-23T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12815927","reviewer_id":"5503578","reviewer_name":"Madeleine","comments":"We really enjoyed our stay at John's place.

Il est très difficile, voire impossible de dormir profondément. La piscine du complexe n'est pas chauffée et très peu de monde ose s'y baigner plus que quelques minutes. La mini-plage de l'autre côté de la rue inclut des algues rouges pas très attrayantes pour la baignade.

You can tell John put in some effort in setting up this vacation rental. He had a closet full of beach items and plenty of towels. The location is pretty good. The base price of this place is also reasonable.\n\nNow comes the negative parts - the two main negatives are cleanliness and communication. When we booked, John was very responsive. He told us he would send some additional information when we arrived. We landed around 5pm and I had still not heard from John. No check-in instructions or where to park, etc. We waited outside of the apartment for about an hour before John replied.\n\nDuring the first night, I noticed a horrible odor emanating from the bed, the sheets, the pillows, and the comforter. It smelled like a locker room. Upon closer inspection, there were hairs all over the bed, it became pretty clear that nothing was washed in between rentals. This is extremely alarming because it's very unsanitary AND the cleaning fees are quite high for this unit.\n\nWe messaged John about this and received no response. We ended up using our clothes as a pillow and bought some beach towels as a comforter cover. In fact, we did not hear from John until the day we were checking out. He didn't apologize, all he said was the sheets are clean. He told me he would send his cleaner over so we can discuss it. Well, given it was the day of check out, it's a little too late for that. I waited for the cleaner anyway, but he never showed up. Poor way to end an otherwise great vacation.\n\nGiven the poor communication and atrocious cleaning fees, I would not recommend this to anyone until John fixes the issue."},{"_id":"184024148","date":{"$date":"2017-08-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12815927","reviewer_id":"38752891","reviewer_name":"Veronica","comments":"Pulizia scadente, condizionatore che non andava, irraggiungibile L host fino alle ore 14 e la stanza data alle 17:30 ( check in era previsto dalle 12 in poi e noi siam arrivati alle 13). \nAbbiam pulito casa noi.

The view over the square is incredible, you really feel like Evita or something! The location is also great, an enjoyable walk through the heart of the city brings you to the river.\r\n\r\nWhen we stayed (early August) there were a couple of small problems that can be easily fixed when Abel has time - we couldn't get the TV and the washing machine to work, and the pictures were still waiting to be hung on the walls.\r\n\r\nI would definitely point out that the apartment is not air conditioned. This was a problem for us staying in summer, because the bedrooms, fronting onto the square, face west, and so get very hot. However, opening the windows makes the bedrooms very noisy and not easy to sleep in. I don't think this would be a problem for most of the year, but definitely in summer it made us wish that the apartment's heating was actually reverse cycle air conditioning!\r\n\r\nOverall, this is a great apartment, and if I was coming back to Porto I would stay there again - but not in summer."},{"_id":"6714222","date":{"$date":"2013-08-22T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1284759","reviewer_id":"562243","reviewer_name":"Anja","comments":"We stayed in Porto in the beautifull and very luxureous appartment of Abel.

The location of the apartment  overlooking a beautiful square is great: we walked everywhere (and we are grandparents, but maybe fit grandparents). There are a lot of cafes and restaurants in the area and a beautiful famous book store is very near by. The apartment itself is modern, large, very clean and has everything you need for a perfect stay in a beautiful city. The square gets busy on weekend nights: it is pretty common in Europe where people start going out for dinner at 9 PM. But it did not bother us, it was nice to watch young people enjoying themselves.

We left the apartment by foot each day, walking mainly downhill towards the river, and occasionally caught a taxi home (uphill). The location is well known so we had no trouble explaining its location to drivers.\r\n\r\nWe had deliberately timed our visit to coincide with Festa de São João do Porto which is the biggest party of the year. After midnight fireworks by the river we made our way home and then were \"serenaded\" at 2am by about 50 drummers in the square outside our window. It was simply awesome and was the perfect end to the day!\r\n\r\nOverall, a great stay in every way!\r\n\r\nPro tip: if you head out the back gate of the building, you'll find another small square and the Leitaria da Quinta do Paço, a fantastic bakery/cafe.

They were responsive and easy to communicate with before and during our stay.  The flat was easy to find, easy to access, secure and had plenty of space for our family of 3 (1 bedroom with a double bed, the other with 2 single beds).  Lots of food and drink options immediately outside (and the soundproof windows are a nice feature given the popularity of that neighbourhood at night).  We highly recommend the restaurant right next door, Andor Violeta, for innovative and tasty food at a good price. \r\nThanks Abel and Rose!

The apartment is modern and amazingly spacious, bright and airy - looks just like it did in the photos! We spent lots of time at the window just watching the Porto life go by!\r\n\r\nAbel and Rose were really helpful both before and during check in. Rose helped us solve our baggage problem on the day of check in as we arrived first thing in the morning and so she advised us that there were lockers at Trindad station.  Happily the apartment was available earlier than expected and Abel was on hand to check us in - he was super friendly with great recommendations on places to see and eat.  There were also some great spots to eat right near the flat: Andor Violeta immediately next door and the gorgeous Camafeu a couple of doors up.\r\n\r\nWe had only a couple of complaints: (i) the nighttime noise on the square - as others have mentioned it can get loud, especially at weekends and there were a couple of nights we either could not get to sleep or found ourselves woken up due to the loud football fan-style singing; and (ii) the beds were a little uncomfortable - especially the single beds.\r\n\r\nThat notwithstanding, I would not hesitate on recommending this apartment and would definitely book again!  Thanks so much for sharing your lovely apartment with us Abel (and for all of your help Rose!).\r\n\r\nJules \u0026 Family\r\n"},{"_id":"49135358","date":{"$date":"2015-10-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1284759","reviewer_id":"24577796","reviewer_name":"Ane-Marie","comments":"Wir wurden von Abel's Mutter zur verabredeten Zeit freundlich empfangen.

It was exactly as described on the web. Thereis an underground carpark just in front which operates 24 hours and it of a modern design with comfortable access ramps. Abel was on time for the checkin and together with his friend were most helpful with guiding me to a temporary unloading area for my luggage. We enjoyed our stay very much. Tips for the next user: must close the windows facing the square very tight, as it can get very noisy even past midnight when people passing talked loudly without any awareness of making too much noise. Suggestion for Abel: the apartment is well equipped overall but a kettle for making tea or hot water \r\nwould be useful."},{"_id":"78562295","date":{"$date":"2016-06-07T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1284759","reviewer_id":"22114251","reviewer_name":"Lindsey","comments":"Excellent communication before we checked in and thorough tour upon arrival.

The apartment itself is very modern, spacious, nicely equipped and clean. The beds are good. The landlords are very nice and they will help you with whatever question and answer quickly. It's maybe not the cheapest apartment in Porto but in my opinion is was worth the price! You will get a top location and a really luxurious equipment (for an Airbnb). All in all maybe the best Airbnb I ever saw :) The only disadvantage I can report is that it was sometimes quite noisy in front of the bedrooms during the weekend-nights. The fact that the apartment is not far from restaurants, bars and nightlife shows some kind of impact here.

There are many apartments in the same building rented to airbnb.

Não faria muito diferença para nós, portanto não nos incomodamos a princípio. Os colchões das camas do quarto com duas camas são péssimos. É possível sentir a madeira do estrado nas costas. Precisei colocar os dois colchões, um em cima do outro, para ficar confortável. Quando comentei com a host, sugerindo mesmo que fossem trocados para o conforto dos hóspedes, a mesma respondeu que sentia muito se não eram do meu agrado. Não é questão de agrado, é questão de que são realmente antigos, finos e provavelmente de baixa qualidade, extremamente desconfortáveis. Desde o momento da reserva deixamos claro que seríamos três hóspedes, como deve ser feito quando se reserva qualquer acomodação. Ao chegar, só tínhamos toalhas disponíveis para duas pessoas. Ou seja, duas toalhas de banho e duas de rosto. A terceira pessoa a tomar banho teve que escolher entre usar uma toalha molhada ou uma toalha de rosto pequena. Ainda o chuveiro estava completamente sujo. Tanta sujeira que os canais de saída de água estavam entupidos. Ao tentar limpar, começou a sair uma água marrom, muito desagradável. A limpeza do banheiro é tão duvidável que não tive coragem de pisar na banheira sem chinelos após o acontecimento do (Website hidden by Airbnb) toda a sujeira existente no apartamento e o fato de que todos os problemas que já tínhamos tido, tivemos a impressão que o apto estava há muito fechado e não foi preparado para receber hóspedes. Ao contactar Rose, com quem conversamos em todos os momentos desde a reserva, para falar de todos os problemas, Rose disse que 1) o chuveiro sujo deveria ser apenas minha impressão, 2) sentia que os colchões não fossem de meu agrado, como já coloquei antes e 3, que haviam mais toalhas no armário do corredor. O armário se encontrava trancado e nada mais foi dito até o dia seguinte, quando às 10h da manhã Rose disse que enviaria uma equipe de faxina para resolver a limpeza e também a questão das toalhas. Retornamos ao apartamento e nada tinha sido feito quanto ao que tinha apontado para a anfitriã. Foram necessárias 24 horas e dois banhos em que meu pai usou uma toalha de rosto para se secar para que Rose nos dissesse que havia uma chave que abriria a porta do armário e nos daria acesso às toalhas. A essa altura, já tinha reportado todos os problemas ao Airbnb e dito a ela que a partir de então trataria com a empresa, pois a mesma não havia dado nenhum retorno e assistência. Um problema tão simples não foi resolvido com rapidez e precisão. Ainda a comunicação é péssima, pois todos os problemas reportados foram tratados com descaso e como se fosse mera impressão minha. Quando ouviram minhas reclamações, não fizeram nada para resolvê-las e Rose achou ruim quando notifiquei o Airbnb e parei de..."},{"_id":"227278603","date":{"$date":"2018-01-14T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1284759","reviewer_id":"23981198","reviewer_name":"Sara","comments":"A casa do Abel é fantastica em termos de localização.

It’s just on one of the main squares and close to everything. There are great restaurants and bars literally on your doorstep. Zenith downstairs always had a queue for brunch! We liked Aduela just around the corner for a drink. Actually they had the best bottle of vinho verde we had on the whole trip!\n\nThe flat is well set up, the two rooms are quite private from one another. And they’re separated from the kitchen/living area. It’s more spacious than it looks in the pictures. There’s an elevator up to the flat if you have luggage too.\n\nThe bedrooms do face the square so you can hear some noise but it’s not a particularly late night/noisy area. The windows are modern though so if you shut them you won’t hear anything. There are a double set of blinds so it’s really dark if you want to sleep in.\n\nThe kitchen has enough basic equipment to do some cooking but then you’d be missing out on all the great restaurants in Porto! There’s a supermarket (Pingo Doce) just up the street for supplies but actually you can get much better fruit and vegetables at the little shops nearby.\n\nChecking in was super easy and we had great communication from the host. We’d definitely stay again!"},{"_id":"282429018","date":{"$date":"2018-06-27T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1284759","reviewer_id":"4245983","reviewer_name":"Micah","comments":"Great place and experience.

Getting in and out of the apartment is a slightly complicated process involving two codes punched into different keypads and a bunch of steps, but once you're in it's a nice roomy two-bedroom.

No entanto, o apartanento falhou no quesito limpeza. Quando acabamos de chegar, a moça da limpeza estava saindo... mas parece que ela não fez absolutamente nada. Havia centímetros de pó por todos os eletrônicos da casa e a mesa de jantar estava grudenta, cheia de marcas de copos e comida, além disso algumas roupas de cama não foram lavadas. No entanto, o pior ponto foi a falta de dedetização do apartamento. Toda vez que acordavamos e ascendiamos a luz existiam dezenas de baratas que desapareciam minutos depois... não pudemos utilizar nenhum utensílio de cozinha, pois os insetos passavam pelos mesmos.

The beds were very comfortable and the kitchen was well equipped for all our cooking needs. \nThe house is located outside the busyness of Kona but close enough for an easy drive to the shops there and that much closer to the south to the beaches and volcano park. There are also a number of beaches close by, each unique in its own way. Two step beach has amazing snorkelling that we wish we had discovered the first day so we could have gone back every day of our trip. \nWe had a great stay and wish we could have stayed longer."},{"_id":"310712618","date":{"$date":"2018-08-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12857433","reviewer_id":"55191669","reviewer_name":"Caroline","comments":"Robert is a nice host.

We greatly appreciated the fully stocked kitchen (particularly the coffee grinder for our Kona Joe’s coffee), snorkel/beach gear, laundry, and local recommendations, and the location was close to all the best snorkeling on the island!  I wasn’t stoked about the gecko that dropped on my head during breakfast on the lanai, but the rest of my group was extremely entertained. Robert was super quick to respond to any questions we had (which were few because he provided us with all the info we could possibly need beforehand), and I even got a sweet Christmas card and Hawaii calendar prior to our trip!   Highly recommend!"}]}

Thank you for your interest in one of our vacation rentals.  We are a TEAM of professionals who manage individually owned condo apartments for the owners when they aren't using them within several different condo / hotel buildings in Waikiki.   We offer a range of accommodations types from small studio apartments (with or without kitchenettes) to 2 bedroom residences with full kitchens.  \r\n\r\nWe want your stay to be an enjoyable one and finding the right match for you is key.  As a general guideline, there are many different types of buildings and hotel-type of arrangements.  For those doing Hawaii on a budget, studios offer the best of both worlds providing a clean, private place to stay within walking distance to the BEACH at affordable prices (vary for upgrades, views, cooking abilities).   For those looking for nicer or larger accommodations, then you should target $150/night off season to $250/night peak season (vary for upgrades, views, cooking abilities, building amenities, parking included).  If you are looking for an Ocean-front experience, then target $350- $400/night and for a luxury experience, $500 to over $1000/night.  Hawaii offers something for everyone at every price point!  \r\n\r\nOur vacation rental units are privately owned and managed.  We offer an alternative to the hotel experience allowing our guests to “live like a local” in paradise whether be for a few days, a few weeks or a few months.  Our units are well maintained, repaired when necessary and treated routinely with pest control services.  We try not to interrupt our guests during their stay, and if the unexpected happens, we do our best to resolve it quickly with the least inconvenience to our guests.   Upon arrival, we try to meet all our guests personally to register, check-in, and answer any questions.  And if you’re running late don’t worry, we can make arrangements no matter the hour and register you in the office the next day.  \r\n\r\nStop by our real estate office, ground floor of Kuhio Village.  We are there daily to assist and share this incredibly beautiful island, local eateries, activities and entertainment found in Waikiki and around the island.  We look forward to hosting you in one of our vacation rental units and helping to make your stay a fantastic one.  A hui hou (until we meet again)!\r\n\r\nAloha \u0026 Mahalo nui loa (Hello/Goodbye \u0026 Thank you very much),\r\nHawaii Dream Realty Team, Hi’ilani, Luise \u0026 Theresa\r\nHawaii Dream Realty LLC RB-19373, Theresa Harden PB (R) RB-19372","host_response_time":"within an hour","host_thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b88480d7-a8b5-4520-af09-d7f3781d7d09.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","host_picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b88480d7-a8b5-4520-af09-d7f3781d7d09.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","host_neighbourhood":"Waikiki","host_response_rate":100,"host_is_superhost":false,"host_has_profile_pic":true,"host_identity_verified":false,"host_listings_count":40,"host_total_listings_count":40,"host_verifications":["email","phone","reviews","jumio","selfie","government_id","identity_manual"]},"address":{"street":"Honolulu, HI, United States","suburb":"Oʻahu","government_area":"Primary Urban Center","market":"Oahu","country":"United States","country_code":"US","location":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-157.82357,21.27638],"is_location_exact":true}},"availability":{"availability_30":14,"availability_60":33,"availability_90":63,"availability_365":334},"review_scores":{"review_scores_accuracy":9,"review_scores_cleanliness":8,"review_scores_checkin":9,"review_scores_communication":9,"review_scores_location":9,"review_scores_value":9,"review_scores_rating":85},"reviews":[{"_id":"75812270","date":{"$date":"2016-05-23T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12873224","reviewer_id":"66661625","reviewer_name":"喜祥","comments":"今回初めて利用しましたが､大きなﾄﾗﾌﾞﾙもなく快適に過ごす事ができました!ｽﾀｯﾌの皆さんがとてもいい人たちだったのは間違いありませんw"},{"_id":"80249278","date":{"$date":"2016-06-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12873224","reviewer_id":"57457667","reviewer_name":"Michael","comments":"Host is very organized and responsive so you don't have to be. Enjoy Oahu and Waikiki, they'll let you know how to get the keys, painless process, and if you need anything, they are quick and present, otherwise you could as well be the condo owner yourself, for the degree of interaction needed, they are invisible unless needed. Condos are in a great location, three minute walk to the beach, good food around, and for those who like the security, it's keyfob to get in the elevator, keyfob to select your floor, security guard on at night, cameras, and keys to the doors, with deadbolts. Nice little welcome basket with coffee and a few sweets. Internet is often slower than mainlanders expect (but some condos are faster than others) but you're not here to surf or stream, right? The host isn't an ISP, but it's nice to have internet in the condo also.

The host did everything they could to make us feel comfortable and keep the place clean so it was nobody's fault. It just sucked because I am terrified of roaches.\r\n\r\nThe team is fast at responding and communication is superb.

Which saved us $$$.\nGreat location with only a two minute walk to the main strip and beach. \nWell priced for Hawaii, as we paid 1/4 of the price of what my other friends paid and we were one street away from them with a bigger room and our own kitchen. \nOnly cons of the accommodation were that the quilt and pillows were a little thin, and it was a little cold at nights. \nWould also have been useful to have a broom to sweep the floor during our 9 days stay, because we spent so much time at the beach, our bathroom got a little messy with sand. I like to keep areas clean and it was difficult to do so without a broom. \nOur trip was for a family wedding and Hawaii is quite expensive for accommodation. Out of all our family who stayed for the 9 days, we got the best price at 1/4 of what the others paid and we had a kitchen which they did not. We were also only one street away from the family and still got the best value for money that they were all regretting paying so much for accommodation.

Thank you for your interest in one of our vacation rentals.  We are a TEAM of professionals who manage individually owned condo apartments for the owners when they aren't using them within several different condo / hotel buildings in Waikiki.   We offer a range of accommodations types from small studio apartments (with or without kitchenettes) to 2 bedroom residences with full kitchens.  \r\n\r\nWe want your stay to be an enjoyable one and finding the right match for you is key.  As a general guideline, there are many different types of buildings and hotel-type of arrangements.  For those doing Hawaii on a budget, studios offer the best of both worlds providing a clean, private place to stay within walking distance to the BEACH at affordable prices (vary for upgrades, views, cooking abilities).   For those looking for nicer or larger accommodations, then you should target $150/night off season to $250/night peak season (vary for upgrades, views, cooking abilities, building amenities, parking included).  If you are looking for an Ocean-front experience, then target $350- $400/night and for a luxury experience, $500 to over $1000/night.  Hawaii offers something for everyone at every price point!  \r\n\r\nOur vacation rental units are privately owned and managed.  We offer an alternative to the hotel experience allowing our guests to “live like a local” in paradise whether be for a few days, a few weeks or a few months.  Our units are well maintained, repaired when necessary and treated routinely with pest control services.  We try not to interrupt our guests during their stay, and if the unexpected happens, we do our best to resolve it quickly with the least inconvenience to our guests.   Upon arrival, we try to meet all our guests personally to register, check-in, and answer any questions.  And if you’re running late don’t worry, we can make arrangements no matter the hour and register you in the office the next day.  \r\n\r\nStop by our real estate office, ground floor of Kuhio Village.  We are there daily to assist and share this incredibly beautiful island, local eateries, activities and entertainment found in Waikiki and around the island.  We look forward to hosting you in one of our vacation rental units and helping to make your stay a fantastic one.

The room is tiny with a balcony facing the city/mountains, which I didn’t realize. It does have a balcony but you can walk around to the adjacent rental’s balcony (small opening in the wall) so I always felt like I need to lock my balcony door. Definitely feels more like an old hotel than a private air b\u0026b. The room has a stale smell, the bathroom sink didn’t drain and the floor was dirty so I wore flip flops the entire time. The price is steep for what you get but it does get you close to the beach."}]}

My family and I had an amazing time there. Very cozy \u0026 comfortable place to chill between island excursions. The space is large and open with spectacular views as described. The outdoor patio furniture is a little weathered but not bad. We appreciated having the beach chairs and soft coolers to take with us on our adventures. There was no air conditioning in unit, which wasn't really an issue due to the weather being a bit cooler and rainy during our stay, but there are plenty of fans to circulate the air. Master bedroom has a movable wall for opening the space during the day and privacy at night. There's nothing better than drifting off to sleep to the sound of waves crashing and waking up to the same tranquility.

The parking space alone was priceless! But the bed and pull-out were also comfortable, we loved lounging on the screened-in deck, and the kitchen was nicely appointed (aside from missing a microwave, which we assumed was there to heat up leftovers). The only other amenity that would have improved our stay would have been an air conditioner. The fans were nice, but as a second-floor unit, it gets warm. Otherwise, we felt like this was a great find in a great location, and the host was very communicative and did everything she could to ensure we had a nice stay.

With the sofa bed pulled out and our luggage laid out, it felt cramped for three people. Once I left, my friends told me the place felt much more spacious and comfortable.

I would do research before to see if booking a tour with an outside company or going on your own may be better fit. We were short on time so what she offered us worked best for us.

It was very comfortably sized for 2 people, I’d imagine it’s a bit tight with 4 guests (at least adults, I’d imagine 2 children on the pullout couch is easily done).The shower took a minute or two to heat up, but there was plenty of hot water once it did, and you’ll really appreciate that on the Big Island (not every place has such ample hot water in our experience). \r\n\r\nThe apartment complex felt safe and was quiet, especially considering it’s close to a busy street (really, noise is not a concern here despite being close enough to all the action of Kona). There’s plenty of access to groceries within a walk or short drive, just a few minutes on a highway to a Target, local grocery store is a 2 minute walk. The ease of access to the beach and attractions of Kona are probably understated in the listing. \r\n\r\nThe host was very kind and went out of her way to make our stay enjoyable, going above and beyond to make recommendations of things to do in town and how to find some of the local gems we’d only read about. \r\n\r\n10/10 would book again! \r\n"},{"_id":"115434538","date":{"$date":"2016-11-24T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12893035","reviewer_id":"16770588","reviewer_name":"Maria","comments":"Adrienne was excellent, always responding to emails promptly.

You don't have to worry about parking.  Easy access to main road to drive to other beaches along the coast.  We walked down to the pier for the Body Glove Sunset Dinner Cruise which was a nice time.  Adrienne responded in a timely manner with any questions that we had."},{"_id":"182515183","date":{"$date":"2017-08-14T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12893035","reviewer_id":"49642005","reviewer_name":"Scott","comments":"Very nice and well located place.

Lack of air con not a problem except in the bedroom where there is less air flow than in the living room. Lanai was amazing, especially with the fan and porch light. Few bugs but easily managed, and I think it's just virtue of the island as we saw lots more outside the apartment, particularly in our hire car which was unfortunately infested with cockroaches, so a watch out for anyone collecting cars from kona airport! Adrienne was amazingly helpful, we had a maintenance issue during the stay and she sorted it within 24 hours!

The apartment was really clean, well presented and comfortable. It was bigger than we expected and the couch was super comfy to lounge on after a long day of exploring. Thanks to Adrienne and Christopher’s clear instructions check in was a breeze and the flat was easily located. The hosts were accommodating and allowed us to check in a couple of hours earlier when we arrived earlier than expected. We found the bed super comfy and sleeping easy with the fan running.

Had everything we needed and was such a great location central between the north and south ends of the island.  We went to the north tip one day and the south tip the next.  Bed was sooooo comfortable. Shower was clean and high pressure.  Lots of shelves for your things and a closet with hangers.  No AC but with the fans we were more than comfortable!

I liked this place because it had a full kitchen with microwave, toaster oven, fridge and all utensils and bowls. I like that their knives weren't as terrible as other places I been to where it was difficult to cook with. They have a shared coin operated washer and dryer in the complex that was cheap too. My only critics is this place isn't in the best shape and a few repairs could be made to make it better but as a visitor I wasn't bothered by it. Also, this place needs a better TV.

The neighborhood is very safe and we all felt immediately \"at home.\" I cannot say enough about the customer service provided by Flatbook.  Upon check we had an issue with the lockbox.  Erika was over within 5 minutes to assist us.  She was kind, personable and professional.  We had a small issue with one the beds that had not been properly assembled.  We sent a message and within hours someone came and delivered a new bed. There was a minor issue with front door of the building as it appeared someone had broken a hinge. This didn't really compromise security but I let them know as I thought it would polite.  It was fixed before I saw it again.  I have stayed at hotels with maintenance teams on site that could not provide this level of customer service.  They truly deliver on their promise of 5 star 24 hour service.

We had a rental car (they had a garage parking spot saved for us, which was really great), but a rental would make commute around Honolulu a lot easier from here.

Kitchen well stocked w amenities, utensils, and has coffee/creamer/pasta/cooking oil etc. Air conditioning and all compliances worked well. Washer/dryer that was not coin operated! The entire space was very clean and located downstairs to the main house. There were many extra towels, beach towels, extra bedding, extra toiletries in the bathrooms etc. Everything was there to make our trip comfortable. Beds were comfortable and the ceiling fans kept temperature at night comfortable.\nSurrounding area: There are several cats and kittens wondering around, they were actually cute and didn't bother us. There are also chickens/roosters in neighboring yards (which do crow in the morning), so it may take a day or two to get used to them. \nHosts: They are quite wonderful.

When we where entering to the place from Elise the Puamana Ocean Breeze Bungalow we felt like at home. The place is even better as shown on the picture. It is very clean and tastefully furnished. The kitchen has everything you need to cook. And all the bedrooms are very nice. You got even surfboards or bikes to use. We had every morning our breakfast on the porch which was always a very nice start into the day. From the house you will get in approx. 30“ to the ocean where you can enjoy every day the moast romantic sunsets. Its just fantastic. Puamana Ocean Breeze Bungalow is located close to Lahaina where you also find a lot of nice restaurants and grocery stores. And from Puamana you also can do realy nice daytrips like going snorkeling or do the road to Hana, to Wailea Makena or you go to Haleakala where you have a nice few on 10000 Feet over Maui (if the weather is nice) And if you just feel like relaxing than the ocean pool from Puamana is the perfect place just to calm down an enjoy the beauty of the pacific. Right in front of the club house are two surf spots where my son and daughter went surfing every morning. We just can highly recomand this beautiful place and we are still overwhelmed. Thank you so much Elise for having us. You have been always so nice and flexible and did respond very quick to our e-mails and answers. We had a realy great time and we will miss this quiet and romatic place.

We were both fascinated by how much Puamana reminded us of our Southern California childhoods in the 60's and 70's - except it was the childhood we both aspired to and not so much the one we actually had! The grounds were immaculate, the location ideal, and the bright, beach-themed bungalow was absolutely perfect for us. We especially noticed how quiet it was - no traffic noise at all, just the very light purr of the waves in the middle distance. Elise was very quick and complete with all communication, which comforted me since we had never been to Hawaii and I really wanted to make sure we were stepping into a good situation. This was also a surprise anniversary/birthday trip for my wife so I needed everything to be perfect. With all the great beach-fun gear provided by Elise and the easy walk to the private beach (Puamana is a private, gated community), we had the makings of many warm, sweet memories. And yes, we did take her advice and had both morning coffee and sunset snacks at the clubhouse! I haven't even mentioned the location - a mile from the heart of Lahaina and just another 5 minute drive up to Black Rock. We took full advantage of both places and still had plenty of downtime to recharge and relax at the bungalow. We are still in the glow of the whole trip, but really, I cannot recommend Elise's bungalow enough."},{"_id":"206288642","date":{"$date":"2017-10-24T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12929092","reviewer_id":"31428052","reviewer_name":"Holly","comments":"Elise's place was  perfect for our mother/daughter getaway.

The home was beautiful and more than expected.  The private lanai with outdoor seating was a perfect start to every morning.   The home was tastefully decorated, clean, and welcoming!  The location was so perfectly close to downtown Lahaina.   Elise was lightening quick in responses when there was only 1 key left at the home vs 2, and 2 additional keys were made on the spot.   The home is in a wonderful private gated community with friendly neighbors/ guests.   The quiet hours also made for relaxing evenings to wind down after fun-filled days.   Our teenage son LOVED having a large upstairs loft all to himself as well.   Elisa also provided a wealth of local knowledge and helpful tips and recommendations as well. \n\nMy only comments would be that while walking or biking into Lahaina is absolutely possible, there is no shoulder on the road and quite a bit of vehicle  traffic.  I don't recommend biking with smaller/ younger children if possible.   However, downtown is just perfect for walks, great food and drink options, and welcoming locals.  We can't wait to return!!!  Thank you for opening your home to us!  We will be back again."},{"_id":"253538357","date":{"$date":"2018-04-14T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12929092","reviewer_id":"45042634","reviewer_name":"Andrew","comments":"Our family of five enjoyed a wonderful week at the bungalow! The location is excellent, close enough to town that it is convenient, but the property is not at all crowded. We used the pools on site and  walked down to the public beach at the end of the property. While the kitchen and bathroom spaces are on the smaller side, the loft easily accommodated our three older kids and the lanai gives ample room for everyone to spread out. You can enjoy a morning cup of coffee at the side of the bungalow, where Elise has set up a small table and chair set, and watch the surf roll in. We did experience a little noise from neighbors, but less than you would at a typical hotel. Overall this was a great experience for our family."},{"_id":"265077925","date":{"$date":"2018-05-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12929092","reviewer_id":"91508007","reviewer_name":"Angela","comments":"What you see on line is truly what you get with way more!

We initially estimated our arrival at 4PM, but ended up arriving around 3PM and only gave Hugo 30 minutes notice. Regardless he was there waiting for us and gave us a thorough explanation of the apartment, location and sites for us to visit.\r\n\r\nWe are a family of two adults and two children. The apartment is not really optimal for small children, because of the rickety staircase. But we made due with the sleeping arrangements on the first floor and had a great time.\r\n\r\nThe apartment is small but very nicely decorated and was exactly as described. The location is great. Just next to the Ponte Luís I bridge and the riverside restaurants. The apartment faces away from the water but this allows for a small terrace facing toward the cliff side, which was very nice for a spot of air. \r\n\r\nHugo also has a deal with a breakfast delivery service, whom left a beautiful basket outside our door. The service also catered to Hugos high service standard and replaced the coffee in our basket with chocolate milk, which was immensely more popular with our children.\r\n\r\nI can only give my best recommendation to both Hugo and the apartment. It is a beautiful space in a prime location at a semi affordable rate.

We were not told that the code to get into the front door and to our apartment would be voided exactly at noon.  We had to make a quick run to a shop just next door and got back to the apartment and could not get in.  We were 5 minutes late.   We finally got in and the cleaning crew was waiting for us with some very impatient faces.  We were all packed, we just had to toss a couple of things in a bag and leave.  We always tip cleaning crews, and this time we were able to hand the tip to them in person, which seemed to ameliorate the situation.  Otherwise, all went smoothly.

We were unsure about staying in Queens is opposed to Manhattan, worried that we might feel slightly out of the way, but we had absolutely no need to worry at all - the subway is round the corner (next to the best chinese take-away ever!) and really does take you to the thick of it within ten minutes. There is also a lovely river walk about 15 minutes away which give you the most wonderful views of Manhattan, and there are loungers to relax on at the waters edge!\r\nThe house is absolutely beautiful (you can tell Orestes is an architect), you have your own front door and the room is plenty big enough (I stayed with a friend - she slept on the double futon which was very comfy). It also has air conditioning. The bathroom is stunning, with a huge steam room/shower, and it is not shared with anyone else. We were given plenty of fresh towels most days. Orestes' office is on the same floor and then the back garden is just lovely - a great place to sit and eat a takeaway or, as we did, sit and have breakfast.\r\nAs a host Orestes was faultless really! He was very friendly and helpful, and we enjoyed telling him about our day - he was happy to recommend places to see and to eat, but also totally respected our privacy and we felt would have probably left us totally to our own devices if we'd wanted. He also had a lovely little dog called Kiki!\r\nThere was no weird faff with deposits or cleaning fees, everything was simple and wonderful.

Most of the evenings the cigarette smoke was unavoidable, though not too bad if you kept the door to the guest room shut.  (Being first-trimester-pregnant, my nose and nausea levels felt sensitive to this, but I imagine it wouldn't be an issue for most folks, unless you had asthma or some other sensitivity.)\r\nOn whole, it was a good home base for our week in New York; everyone was friendly and the accommodations were nice."},{"_id":"996986","date":{"$date":"2012-03-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12937","reviewer_id":"1795764","reviewer_name":"Mistie","comments":"Orestes was a great host!

His place is amazing.  The room is more like a suite in that it has a couch to watch TV in addition to a very comfotable bed.  There is also a small fridge  and coffee machine.  During our stay the temp was over 100 degrees outside but the room has great A/C so we were very comfortable.  Also, the room is super quiet.  The bathroom is fantasic....huge!  Great dog named KIKI too.\r\n\r\nThe location is 1 block away from the 7 train.  You can't beat this.  10 min to Grand Central Station and Central Park....15 min to Times Square.

Orestes’ home exudes a special warmness, also thanks to its interesting décor which comes from the mind of two very talented people. Orestes and Cristian are wonderful, friendly and warm hosts; they made us feel extremely welcome and at home from the moment we arrived. As for location, we couldn't have asked for a better one. The triplets are ideally located on a quiet historic street where we could rest peacefully after long days spent out \u0026 about, away from the hustle and bustle of the city. There are loads of nice restaurants (try LIC Market if you get the chance, great food \u0026 atmosphere!) and shops close by as well as a 24/7 diner; just minutes away from Manhattan by subway (with multiple train choices) and only a short walk away from the best view of the skyline you'll experience by far! The room itself is perfect in size, comfortable and very clean; it also has a sofa, TV, mini fridge, coffee maker and walk in wardrobe which, albeit small, is extremely handy! The bathroom has the best shower ever, amazing ...I still miss it \u0026 wish I could have taken it back with me ;) Last but not least, there is a lovely garden at the back where you can unwind, soak in the sun or have breakfast al fresco! We really couldn't have wished for better! Thank you Orestes and Cristian for opening your home to us and  for making our stay perfect.

I was expecting an intimate local experience with the benefit of getting an insider's take on my first visit to the fabulous city that is NY. Unfortunately, Orestes was away on holidays (which I only found out when I rang him a day before I arrived) the whole 5 days I was there. He said a good friend (who introduced herself as his neighbor) would be living there instead. The first day a non-English speaking house-cleaner was there to meet me to pass me the keys. Because I spent the first afternoon sightseeing I arrived to a quiet house at 10.30pm and spent the first night not knowing who was in the house. The next morning at the first sound of noises/footsteps in the house I went upstairs to wait to meet 'the neighbour' before she headed off to work. This was the only time I saw her in my stay but awoke every morning to the sounds of multiply people coming in and out of the only entrance which is through the bottom front door right next to do the guest bedroom.  I was never told who was going to be in the house and by the end of 5 days I counted at least 5 people, one other guy living in the same house (who never introduced himself), a dog walker and work colleagues of Orestes who made use of the 2 workstations in the same level as the bedroom for at least 2 of the days. One work collegue was working until 1 am one morning. Considering there is an opaque ceiling to floor window in the bathroom which is clearly visible from the working area I didn't feel comfortable taking a shower at night. Also my \"private\" bathroom was used by the work colleagues. Although I was out for most of the days, due to the wooden floor boards I could hear people walking/stomping around late at night and early mornings. The photos are accurate, the house is nice. However, the room you stay in is on the basement level along with 2 work place areas. There were written rules left including one never to lock the front door when you were inside (otherwise you can lock others out!). I never heard from Orestes, was never offered help or advice and had no communication who had access to the house.  Disappointing considering all the rave reviews. I would have felt safer and got a lot more personal attention and clearer communication staying in a hotel. My girlfriend who also stayed a couple of nights was also disappointed by the fact we were sightseeing 'blind' and that we had no idea who was in the upper levels of the house. For safer, more personal attention and less wasting time on subways I recommend staying in a hotel around East Village. P.S. my bed sheet was covered in dog hairs."},{"_id":"5984981","date":{"$date":"2013-07-25T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12937","reviewer_id":"6584551","reviewer_name":"Antje","comments":"We had a great stay at Orestes beautiful home.

He was there to meet us and he had allowed us to arrive an hour early. It was clean and airy and plenty of space allowed us to spread out . He let us settle in and offered to help out if we needed anything.  He also let us have our privacy, although he does use the downstairs space for work, it is not noisy or intrusive and we weren't there much in the day. \r\nWe had a split stay in NY and the first leg we stayed in an impersonal Mid Town Hotel - Just like any other city BUT\r\nStaying in  LIC Queens was a real treat, it is so unique and very close to the river, has awesome city skyline views plus we worked out the subs easy enough and it was as close as he says. It only took us 10 mins on the sub to get home at night!. You walk that much at least to a hotel, and Subs are everywhere.  It was really nice to come home to a quiet space every night.  We also appreciate healthy food options and found really great food at a quality., modern Food cellar supermarket in Long Island City! it was awesome with a huge range of wholesome, organic  salads and healthy choices and only 5 mins walk.\r\nI would absolutely recommend you consider staying here, in a beautiful street, with quiet neighbourhood, a lovely, rare city garden as a treat and so very close to Manhattan.

We had use of a guest computer and printer, which was really handy for sorting through photos and printing out tickets, etc. Orestes had to fly out half way through our stay, but Gabriella stayed to house-sit, and she was just as friendly and great to chat with! We loved Orestes' dog, Kiki, as well. It was a great base to come back to after a full day of exploring - it was quiet, safe and extremely close to the subway. There was also a diner round the corner that provided a quick and cheap dinner when needed. Overall, Orestes was a great host, the neighbourhood was perfect, and the house itself was beautiful - we would definitely stay here again.

The bathroom is superb, very nicely designed and the shower is something to look forward to after a long hot New York day.

Orestes was a very helpful and accommodating host and helped us out with our daily touring/planning.  The bedroom unit has all the amenities one would need, assuming you are there to see New York, and not simply stay in the bedroom. The location of this residence is so perfect, on a quite tree lined street, but yet a few minutes walk to the major subway lines, restaurants, convenience stores, and water front.  I am a Landscape Architect and Oreste has done a wonderful job with his rear yard/garden oasis, and it was so nice to sit in the heavily landscape yard in the morning, and one would never know they were so close to Manhattan.

As first time travelers to NYC, we wanted to be close to or in Manhattan. We chose this property because it was close to the city but allowed us to escape the hustle and bustle. The property is only a minute walk from Courts Square metro and the subway goes directly into Manhattan. 15 minutes and you're in Times Square. It is quick, cheap (about $2.50 one-way) and convenient. An Uber or taxi from Downtown is about $30. The neighborhood itself is quintessential gritty Queens but did not appear dangerous and the street itself is beautiful and quite. \nThe room exceeded our expectations. We thought it would be a small space, but it was the size of a standard hotel room. It was clean. It has a mini fridge, microwave, couch, double bed and air conditioning. The bed was soft and the room was quiet. The bathroom was fantastic. A proper bathroom with big shower, plenty of hot water - plus a sauna feature. \nBoth Orestes and Cris were wonderful hosts. They were accommodating to our requests and were very welcoming with their home. They lived upstairs, allowing for privacy as well as access to free wifi and most of the whole bottom floor. We were also offered full use of the courtyard at the back, which would be perfect for breakfast in the sunshine or to read a book. \nThis place is a definite gem and we would highly recommend staying here again.

The home is a 1t minute walk to the ferries, and you will have a chance to look at the spectacular city from across the water. Mind you,  if you are not ready to socialize, this place is not for you! You will have privacy in your own space but the host does work out of the home office beside your quarters, so you might hear each other when you're both on the same floor. My husband and I were more than happy to chat with Orestes and get some local tips from him so that's a big plus.

Whilst the room is private, it is adjacent to Orestes workshop, which is fine and has direct access into his apartment upstairs. The area is safe and nice to walk around. It’s only a 10 minute walk to the ferry terminal too and I’d recommend doing that as it’s a nice walk along the river too to the next stop down.

My stay was very short as I was heading to the airport, and it's a relatively easy walk to the airport if you don't have too much luggage.

A living room/ kitchen and a bathroom were shared. There was a small frig and a small laundry machine. Rooms were very sparkling clean and new. A big TV was in a common living room. Communication was fast and clear. No need to see the host as keys were in a padlock and thus late arrival or early leave is fine. A host seems to live in a house annexed to the AirBnB rooms but entrances were different. Actually, his house is a proper detached house. 15 minutes walk to an international terminal. No need to take a cab if you go to an international terminal. Walk to an int terminal is safe but is not a no trainer due to a airport construction. But it is not too difficult to find a way to it. It is a great place to stay overnight if you have a morning flight. Very competitive price. Good for two people (queen bed), even with a small kid.

It didn’t bother me too much apart from realising how important cooling is for guests, especially if they are only really sleeping for 4-5 hours and then travelling again.

Overall a convenient stay. However, the room is walking distance from the international airport., 10 to 15 minutes. It is a 18$ uber from the domestic airport. Also the room price is deceiving as it initially said 43$ a night it changed to 53$ when paying and then a cleaning and service fee was also attached bringing the room to 68$ a night, almost double from the airnb quote per night that is stated. So I was unhappy with that surprise but was desperate for a last minute room and took it. The owner seems to be a good business man however he needs to communicate the costs before hand to the customer so there are no surprises."},{"_id":"278365302","date":{"$date":"2018-06-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12954762","reviewer_id":"74790855","reviewer_name":"Vanessa","comments":"tidy and clean,  within 20mins walk from the airport, very convinient. thanks!"},{"_id":"278824693","date":{"$date":"2018-06-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12954762","reviewer_id":"66189691","reviewer_name":"Xiangyu","comments":"离机场很近  非常适合赶早班机的朋友们"},{"_id":"279491421","date":{"$date":"2018-06-20T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12954762","reviewer_id":"111501115","reviewer_name":"Jessica","comments":"Great accommodation.

Fica a 2mn do metro que nos leva a qualquer lugar. Fica a 10mn a pé do centro da cidade e onde não falta nada. E por fim a anfitriã Sílvia é de uma simpatia, atenciosa e cuidadosa com os viajantes.
