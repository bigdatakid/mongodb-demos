He was very charming and welcoming even though we were an hour late. He responded to all inquiries and shared lots of helpful information. \r\nThe apartment is fantastic! It is very well laid out, spotlessly clean, and very comfortable. As others have said, the views (in two directions-- over the city and Montjuic) are amazing. \r\nWhat we particularly appreciated was being in Poble Sec. It's a charming and real neighbourhood -- off the tourists' beaten track -- but close to the old city. We walked everywhere. The many trails up Montjuic are just outside the door. Right in the neighborhood are the Miro Foundation, the National museum of Catalunya, the hokey and fun Magic Fountain, the CaixaForum cultural space, etc. The Metro is also close by.\r\nWe enjoyed buying our groceries and cooking most of our meals \"at home\" coupled with having a glass of wine and tapas along the chill Carrer de Blai.\r\nI spent a great deal of time choosing where to stay for our 12-night trip and my research was rewarded. December is a challenge with short days. I really wanted as much sun as possible and we got it! I also valued having an elevator. (Most atico apartments are up many flights of stairs.)\r\nKeep in mind, though, that the only source of heat is a small wood stove.

It's such a fantastic experience to sit on the main balcony as the sun is setting and enjoy a few drinks. Even the shower has an amazing view! Certainly the best I've ever seen from a shower! The kitchen and living area is a decent size - all nice and clean too. There's also a log burning stove.\n\nThere was a small issue with the toilet during our stay - you had to reach into the cistern and turn the tap on and then off again each time you used it. This wasn't a significant problem though and didn't really detract from what was a really positive experience overall.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that Ignacio and Sonia kindly allowed us to check in early on our first day - this meant we could drop off our bags and get stuck into the city straight away.

Unfortunately, what wasn't communicated was that the door lock was damaged and that it could take on average 20-30 minutes to enter the unit. When I contacted Ignacio about this problem he suggested that a locksmith would be by the next day to fix it. Two days passed and when I reached out again he seemed surprised. I was disappointed to learn that previous guests had experienced the same problem but nothing was done to fix it. Further, the apartment was incredibly cold and required us to start a small wood fire each day to stay warm (barely). After two nights Ignacio appeared with a fire extinguisher noting that we might need it. I was very alarmed by this, and couldn't help but wonder why this was addressed when we first checked in. The bathroom in particular was icy, making morning showers quite miserable. Lastly, while the apartment was spacious, it lacked basic kitchen essentials - such as a pot to boil water - and had a very dirty sink and shower.

I would recommend this accommodation to anyone, it looks just like the pictures and it's a great location to explore the city! \nThank you, \nBecky "},{"_id":"158517939","date":{"$date":"2017-06-07T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2190616","reviewer_id":"6568765","reviewer_name":"Markus","comments":"Perfect everything!

Given we were there in July it was great to have these spaces to come back to after being in the busy city centre, which although only 20 minutes walk away (downhill) is a contrast to the residential area of Poble Sec. The Montjuic/Poble Sec area although more residential has lots of great places to eat. Carrer de Blai is a five minute walk away, and has many lovely tapas bars which are much better and cheaper than the ones near the more tourist areas such as Las Ramblas. No need to venture any further afield in the evening. The area is close to many museums, and we also swam at the Piscine Municipal \nde Montjuic which is a 10 minute uphill walk away. A well kept secret, and preferable to us than the busy beach in July. I highly recommend the attic apartment and the local area, and we would love to return.

This cannot be understated! Barca has so much to see and do, but the time spent at home, especially during hot days - the apartment was nice and cool - was very pleasant. The location benefits from being close to Carrer de Blai, THE place for evening pinchos in BCN, it's near to the Montjuic cable car, local restaurants are reasonably priced, and the Poble Sec area and wonderful Carrer de Parlament are perfect for cafes, wine bars and other local entertainment. In this sense there is lots to do and the apartment was located in a very peaceful area which can be contrasted to other places to say such as Raval, or El Born, which would be much louder at night.

Nunca nos comunicaron de esto antes de llegar para que lo supiéramos antes de reservar. No fue grato que nos recibieran pidiéndonos más dinero, encima en efectivo y sin entregarnos un recibo. No tenemos forma de saber que esos 20 euros fueron destinados a donde realmente deberían ir. Como no teníamos cambio, le dejamos los 20 euros en el departamento el último día antes de irnos. Se ve que el arrendador no los encontró y en lugar de preguntarnos donde los habíamos dejado, nos acusó de no haber pagado diciendo que \"está cansado de que sea siempre lo mismo\". Hubiese sido más amable que nos consultara donde estaba el dinero antes de acusar de no pagar. Malos modos. \n- La ducha. El agua simplemente no se mantiene tibia. O está congelada o te prendes fuego. \n- Los almohadones de la terraza estaban empapados. Imposible sentarse. No pudimos usarla. \n- No hay calefacción eléctrica en la habitación. Solo un hogar (creo que a leña o algo para encender) y no había nada con que encenderlo. \n- No había frazadas gruesas. Tuvimos que reforzar el abrigo con más sabanas. \n- El ventilador no funcionaba. Nos tocó una noche de calor en la que no pudimos dormir.  \n\nPros del departamento:\n- Muy linda vista, amplio y súper luminoso. \n- Buena ubicación con un bus que usamos mucho a solo 1 minuto del departamento. \n- Plaza España a 10 minutos andando. \n- El arrendador nos recibió en el departamento unas horas antes del check\nIn oficial para que podamos dejar las valijas y nos sugirió lugares para comer. \n\nConclusión:\n- Es recomendable para alquilar pero no sé si al precio que está publicado.

Windows on both sides gave wonderful breezes and light. The kitchen was equipped with just about all amenities (except microwave) and lots of cooking starters, tea and sugar.  Ignacio \u0026 Sonia have compiled a very useful book with restaurant and cafe suggestions in the neighborhood, which unfortunately we could not take full advantage of, just ran out of time! The location of the flat is just perfect, 5 blocks to the metro, just a block from the stairs that lead into the expansive park, and a few blocks in the other direction to the cable car you take up to Montjuic Castle! The only \"con\" was the noise. A very active school recess yard on one side, and a busy street and soccer field on the other. With the windows shut it was better, and was quieter at night. If you're out all day sightseeing, it shouldn't affect your stay. And Ignacio's prompt communication and helpful suggestions, the amenities and the views more than compensated for it.

Ignacio did a fantastic job communicating throughout the whole time before the stay. Super friendly and great job showing us around the apartment and giving us tips for the area. I was even surprised with fruit and champagne seeing as it was my birthday weekend! I was a bit skeptical about not having AC but once we were there, it wasn’t needed at all. The apartment has two balconies and tons of windows in every room, so the breeze was perfect throughout the day and night. The view from the terrace is the cherry on top! I would recommend it to any person coming to Barcelona. It’s located just up the hill but only a 3 min walk to Poble Sec metro stop. Perfectly located near Blai street where you can find lots of lovely tapas restaurants and bars. There’s a blow dryer that works perfectly ( i used it every other day) , along with washing machine. The apartment is much more beautiful and spacious in person and has been renovated from what the posted pictures show.

It was originally a grand Victorian Terrace and had been divided into 5 flats with shared bathrooms.  I embarked on a full renovation with my builder and later employer Michael Wagstaffe which included building another level on top where I now live. I decided to trial Airbnb in mid 2017 in the smallest apartment which has been very successful. In December 2017 apartment 5 became vacant so I upgraded  it for Airbnb to be ready for NYE. I   have installed double glazing and acoustic flooring to make my guests stay as comfortable as possible.  My building is in  vibrant Surry Hills so you can step out the door and find restaurants and bars a plenty than come back to peace and quiet. I try to give the best service possible to my guests.","host_response_time":"within an hour","host_thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/57183508-a16b-46c8-ade9-a07173e750e8.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","host_picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/57183508-a16b-46c8-ade9-a07173e750e8.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","host_neighbourhood":"Surry Hills","host_response_rate":100,"host_is_superhost":true,"host_has_profile_pic":true,"host_identity_verified":true,"host_listings_count":3,"host_total_listings_count":3,"host_verifications":["email","phone","reviews","jumio","offline_government_id","selfie","government_id","identity_manual"]},"address":{"street":"Surry Hills, NSW, Australia","suburb":"Surry Hills","government_area":"Sydney","market":"Sydney","country":"Australia","country_code":"AU","location":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[151.21718,-33.88653],"is_location_exact":true}},"availability":{"availability_30":6,"availability_60":7,"availability_90":28,"availability_365":32},"review_scores":{"review_scores_accuracy":10,"review_scores_cleanliness":10,"review_scores_checkin":10,"review_scores_communication":10,"review_scores_location":10,"review_scores_value":10,"review_scores_rating":99},"reviews":[{"_id":"223840741","date":{"$date":"2018-01-01T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"21939239","reviewer_id":"112055550","reviewer_name":"James","comments":"Don was a really helpful host who responded straight away to all our questions.

Shops, restaurants, and nightlife are all within the surrounding blocks; while the major attractions like the opera house and Harbour Bridge are either a short ride or slightly longer walk away.  Both apartments feature outdoor space; well-equipped kitchens and bathrooms; washer/dryer; air conditioning; and designated living, dining \u0026 sleeping areas.  Everything was spotless; the mattress was comfortable; and the towels were soft and fluffy. \n\nDon was the perfect host — excellent communication, there whenever you needed him and yet invisible if want/need privacy.

Surry Hills is such a cute neighborhood with a bunch of delicious restaurants nearby. This apartment is very close to a couple of great bakeries and a gelato shop that we frequented often. There are also multiple grocery stores of varying sizes within walking distance (5-10 minutes). It's right next to a park that's great to relax at. There are a couple of bus stops that are a 2-5 minute walk away, and Central station (train and bus stop) is only a 10 minute walk away. We didn't have a car and only used the buses to get around, and it worked out really well. It is only about a 15 minute bus ride to the downtown Sydney area with the Opera House, and a very scenic (over the bridge) 45 minute bus ride to the zoo.

Such a pity Hurricane Lane prevented us from making the most of the place, though I definitely enjoyed an early morning dip in the pool when we still had the lovely ocean view!"},{"_id":"316214037","date":{"$date":"2018-08-30T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"21946009","reviewer_id":"138775172","reviewer_name":"Manuel","comments":"Very clean accommodation well located and with the necessary amenities for a perfect stay."},{"_id":"317198255","date":{"$date":"2018-09-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"21946009","reviewer_id":"122400943","reviewer_name":"Caroline","comments":"Location good for Hilo, Botanical Gardens and waterfall exploration.

Perfectly located with a beautiful view, this guest home has all the modern touches along with maintaining its original charm and architecture. \n\nThe guest quarters had ample space-and while it is disclosed in description, it is worth noting that there is only a coffee maker and mini fridge in the room itself. We ate out most meals, so this was perfect for our needs. But, considering there are two beds in the house, if you have a family, there isn’t a microwave/toaster or way to keep warm foods warm-didn’t pose an issue for us. \n\nAlso, there is no TV (again no problem for us, we just happened to be exhausted on our last night and opted to stay in). We had a laptop so we were able to connect to wifi and watch hulu/netflix on our last night-nice and relaxing. \n\nThe hosts are super friendly, very very communicative and gave us wonderful tips and recommendations during our stay. We were beyond grateful for the pool and hot tub-It was the key factor in selecting this house versus others, and it didn’t disappoint!

Everything about staying here was perfect, the location is incredible.

We had use of the kitchen area which was wonderful, one of the nicest houses we’ve ever had the pleasure of staying in. The moment we arrived we felt at home. We have two young children and she was incredibly accommodating, even going to the lengths of pulling her children’s old toys out for our children to play with.

Little shampoos and little body washes. Everything was wiped down and the location was perfect! Right across the street from the Metro and right on the main bar drag of gay village. I would say this is not an ideal location if you need a lot of quiet sleep. I travel with earplugs so I was fine but the floor does vibrate until 0300 with the club right below. Stay here if you don't mind the noise or will be out most nights anyway, it is perfect for a weekend getaway with friends! I was visiting when 15 cm of snow fell and Sonders gave me the option of staying another night when I messaged explaining. I didn't need the extra night, but it was definitely an accommodation that made my stay stress free. They had Tea and small Olive Oil packets available for cooking. The kitchen was stocked with every pan and cookie sheet needed. My only complaint would be the booking process. Sonders is an investment travel company. So when you book through Airbnb you aren't done there. You have to validate yourself with their systems and surveys. Save your time and just book on their website. I would stay here and try other Sonders Properties in the future.

We loved the village feel of the place, even though it is on the edge of Sydney and hosts a fairly major tourist attraction (The Gap). We are more than happy to recommend it.\n\nHighlights:\n1.  The food\n2.  The garden outlook and sense of privacy\n3.  The welcome provided to us by Neil, the host\n4.  Proximity to spectacular locations and lovely walks\n\nProblems:\nThe only thing that we could call a problem was that the Wifi kept dropping out BUT Neil specifically came to tell us about the problem and apologise and to tell us that a technician was coming out the next day to fix it.

The actual place is impeccably and luxuriously designed. It feels incredibly spacious, yet grounded and cozy.  The linens, couch, and king mattress were excellent quality for deep restoration. We ended up planning our trip during an uncharacteristically dreary and rainy week in October, and Neil did everything he could to accomodate us on our beach holiday. We thoroughly enjoyed warming up near the fireplace, and delighted in some sleep ins knowing Neil had already generously taken care of breakfast- a full fruit basket, loaf of bread, yoghurts, croissants, assortment of jams, butter, nut butter, eggs, three kinds of cereal, milk and honey. We mentioned before heading out one evening we were going to get some take away and bring it back, and when we came back Neil had a couple of beers waiting for us packed in ice out in the lush backyard that we had to enjoy in privacy the entire stay. Neil struck the perfect balance between being available when we needed, and giving us lots of privacy. \n\nThe home is on a very quiet street, quality/luxury neighbourhood.

Neil was great with taking any worry out of the visit. The place itself was a tropical getaway from the hustle and bustle of the city, yet very accessible. It was a joy to take the ferry’s everywhere around Sydney (and much more affordable than Uber or taxi). I took at least 10 boat rides in 48 hours which added to the adventure. Download the app as suggested to find all the pick up times. Watson’s bay is a cool little beach town with one hotel. Loved the tropical back yard and swimming pool. Also all the breakfast foods and coffee Neil arranged were great. Thanks again!"}]}

This time we tried booking Airbnb in Sydney. We arrived 11pm at the apartment and our self check-in was so easy. We got surprised that our host Anita prepared cheese, ham, and bread for us. It was a very thoughtful gesture because we were so hungry. She even prepared milk and cookies. Wow, its the first time i ever experienced  this in an Airbnb. Her apartment is way bigger than the normal room at Four Seasons.Everything was so clean.  Plus the amenities are even better.She even had beach towels prepared and beach chairs.  Her bed sheets and towels are high quality. The bed also was very comfortable.  We love her apartment so much.  Personally, we think its the best we have ever stayed at. I'm surprised that this apartment is not yet in the Airbnb Plus category. Because Anita's apartment should be at the Airbnb Super Plus category. She even has Netflix in her Smart TV. Her kitchen is so complete with all the cooking amenities.She even had pasta for us.  In our last night, she even gave us a going away gift. Anita was so sweet and thoughtful.  If there was an award body that gives out awards, Anita should be given the Super Super Host Award for Airbnb. We stayed for 8 days.  She is the best and her apartment is the best we have ever stayed so far. We will surely  be back. A million Thanks Anita!!!!"},{"_id":"260725472","date":{"$date":"2018-05-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"22020910","reviewer_id":"111822854","reviewer_name":"Andrew","comments":"Fantastic location, great host and spotless apartment.

Very easy to get to Brooklyn and Chelsea and midtown which is where we needed to go some days during our stay. Semhar was super responsive and checkin was super simple. \n\nIt's small but has incredibly high ceilings and giant windows.

Lisa was a gracious and accommodating host.  I appreciate very much that she allowed me to pick up the keys one day prior to check-in.  \r\n\r\nAs an ex-New Yorker, there are a few things I'm already prepared for, but there are a few that I wish other reviewers would list:\r\n\r\nIs it quiet?  Yes, very much so, especially back where the bed is located.  Also the neighbors are very considerate in keeping to the quiet hours. \r\nIs the bed comfortable?  The Murphy bed is surprisingly so, although a lot of movement may make the panels rattle a bit.\r\nHow is the water pressure in the shower?  Good.  Water temperature stayed constant.\r\nIs it a walk-up?  yes, be prepared to walk up a few flights of stairs.  I didn't mind and this is very typical for NYC.\r\nHow is the neighborhood?  I bit more remote then usual, but safe and accessible. Lots of places to go eat and have a drink nearby.  I also +1 the recommendation for ABC Beer Co.  \r\nWas there storage space?  yes, Lisa made a closet, a large drawer in a chest of drawers, shelves in the pantry available, and cleared out the bathroom cabinet.  Plenty of room for my needs.\r\nAll in all a good experience.

We heard such great things! However, Lisa had a cold demeanor upon meeting with her, she wasn't very friendly as we anticipated.  And then she told us not to snoop through her things.  I think we knew that from the get go, but it was just interesting that she told us that.  It seemed like she was in a hurry, so just left the keys and went out the door.  \r\n\r\nWe questioned the apartment at first glanced as well, but we wanted to give the experience a chance based on all the great reviews we read.  FYI - the pictures on Airbnb did not showcase the apartment's realistic look. The pictures were obviously enhanced by a professional camera and usage of lighting because half of the apartment is actually dark and dingy. We chose to stay here because we're huge fanatics of natural light, which disappointed us.  The apartment building smelled of really strong incense if you're into that kind of thing, but it just became bothersome after a while.  The bed was not comfortable to sleep on and we woke up several times during the night because it dipped in the center that caused me and my husband to roll inwards.  Super uncomfy! \r\n\r\nThe ad states that this apartment is located in one of the up and coming areas, which was a cool area, however it fails to mention that its location is on a block where it's pretty sketchy and unsafe to walk around in the late hours especially when coming home late at night.  Not our cup of tea!\r\n\r\nFinally, we decided to hold our baggages until 4pm for an additional cost of $35.  There was a breakdown in communication of when to leave the money so Lisa decides to call us SCREAMING and YELLING at my husband for not leaving the money even when he sincerely apologized for misunderstanding over and over.  She goes on and on and then has the audacity to hang up on us and rudely texted us to grab our bags and just leave.  This is not the proper way to treat anyone for any reason!  Especially when we had been good guests for the entire duration of our stay.  It's not polite, unprofessional, and just not right to scream at people when there's a problem.  So be aware everyone! \r\n\r\nOur recommendation, DO NOT deal with a host like Lisa who is unfriendly and disrespectful.  She ruined our last day of vacation and left a very bad taste of our Airbnb experience.  I most definitely recommend that you spend a few more bucks for a much better apartment, area, and host.\r\n\r\nSTAY AWAY! :("},{"_id":"21629555","date":{"$date":"2014-10-20T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"220946","reviewer_id":"22344465","reviewer_name":"Kendall","comments":"I live in Manhattan and stayed at Lisa's apartment for a weekend with my mother who was visiting from out of town.  Lisa's place was just what we were looking for.  It was very clean, newly renovated and updated, and nicely furnished.  She has really made the most of the limited space in an NYC studio apartment and it feels homey and comfortable.  One of the reasons I initially chose her apartment for the weekend was the location- it's a short walk from the many great bars and restaurants that Alphabet City, the Lower East Side and the East Village have to offer.  My mom and I had a great weekend strolling through these neighborhoods.  The only drawback is that the only easily accessible subway is the 2nd Ave F.  If you want to go somewhere that isn't accessible from the F line, some more walking/transferring/cabbing/Ubering is required.  Overall, I would highly recommend Lisa's apartment for a fun, unique downtown experience in NYC.

Neighborhood was pretty decent. If you like motorcycles there is a sweet repair shop on same street that has a great line up of old triumphs and what not in front. We did have a slight problem with the cleanliness. The apt itself was clean (bathroom etc) but the sheets had hair on them and there was lipstick on the towels in the bathroom. We found fresh sheets in the commode and there were fresh towels on the bed. We ended up having to use t-shirts as pillow covers. Lisa was very apologetic but getting clean pillow covers ended up being a bit of a hassle as she was out of town and her handyman had non specific hours.  All in all place was OK, but I feel like maybe we should have just stayed in a hotel. Lisa did offer to pay for linens we bought etc and was concerned about the whole ordeal.

I live in Brooklyn and needed to move out for several days during my home renovation. We chose Lisa's place because of its great central location near some of my favorite bars and restaurants, and walking distance to neighborhoods like Union Square and Soho (shopping, movie theaters, parks). During my down time, her apartment was a cozy, quiet place to relax-- clean, with a bright and comfortable sitting area. Ceiling fans and AC kept the apartment cool during a particularly hot week. Be aware that this apartment is best for someone active-- it's up four steep flights of stairs. On the plus side, there are tons of good food options and convenient stores within 2-3 blocks walk (I loved Croissanteria for breakfast!)"},{"_id":"45417601","date":{"$date":"2015-09-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"220946","reviewer_id":"21050313","reviewer_name":"Peio","comments":"Lisa has created a wonderful home in a great neighborhood.

The neighborhood is the safe, cool, artistic, energetic, and has the feeling of a village... small shops, good markets, original restaurants and a park.  I am so sad to leave.  If you enjoy walking, it is an easy and engaging walk along sweet streets into Chinatown, the lower east side, Soho, Tribeca, the village, Flatiron, Chelsea, and minutes from midtown by cab.

The key pick up/drop off is a comfortable 15 minute walk from the apartment, and offers the not-to-be-missed opportunity to pick up a pastrami sandwich from the amazing Katz's Deli which is en route.  I would happily recommend Lisa's apartment for a visit to the city.

The only thing to look out for (and Lisa mentions this accurately in her description) is that the apartment is pretty far from any subway line.

She went above and beyond to provide everything I could possibly expect out of a stay, and was up front about anything that might otherwise had been a surprise. The room is little more than floor-to-ceiling curtains fully surrounding a bed and some space for a suitcase - but that's all I needed, and what she set me up to expect.\r\nAt night there was quite a bit of noise from a band playing in the building and from street through the open window, but I am not sensitive to that, so it did not bother me or prevent me from getting sleep. It is just something to be aware of. \r\nOverall, this experience was a fantastic value for the location and the service and flexibility provided by the hostess. Will seriously consider coming back here on my next visit to the city!

We traveled by Greyhound, and she was able to tell us how to get to her place with ease (as Manhattan can be a difficult place). Philomena was a great communicator and was able to accommodate our business schedules. Her recommendation on places to eat around the neighborhood as well as in the \"city\" was top-notch. The bed was nice, and the \"room\" had plenty of space to hang up my suits and clothes. It can be a little noisy with the outside windows up at night; however, the noise was less than nothing when the windows were down. The building is a little old so it may feel a little stuffy at times, but this was easy corrected with a passive, noise cancellation fan by the bed that she provided.

Mena's place is in a great location close to everything. The space is a little bigger in person than it looks in the photo on the site, and it's clean and neat. It felt cozy and private when the curtains were drawn and the bed was so comfortable. Mena provided thoughtful touches such as toiletries, an iron and ironing board, and a sound machine to help mask the street sounds at night. I didn't need it; I was so exhausted each day that I fell asleep quite easily, but if you are very sensitive to noises it is there and available for your use. You can hear music from a bar and the radiators hiss when they kick in, but again, it didn't bother me at all - but if you are a person who needs silence to sleep then you will need the sound machine or ear plugs (and you aren't going to get 100% silence anywhere in NYC, even if you stay in a hotel!) Mena was a great host. She was very welcoming and I had a lot of fun talking and going out walking with her. I felt quite safe in the area. Mena's space is perfect if you are going to be out and about most of the day and want a good \"home base\" location. I hope to return.

It was acceptable for me since I ended up coming alone, however I believe listings should make clear whether apartments contain separate enclosed bedrooms or just have some type of dividers, i.e., semi-private.  There were some thoughtful touches (notions, lamps, fan, plus the clean linens) in the sleeping area, and oatmeal \u0026 coffee were prepared the first morning, and available for the second.  The bathroom is very small but everything worked.  I was just disappointed that it hadn't been cleaned.  The location of this apartment a block from Central Park and walking distance to Riverside Park and the Hudson jogging/biking paths, plus shopping, cafes/restaurants, public transportation (directions were precise), and museums on the UWS can hardly be better!  Mena indicated she can also give bike tours of the area.

She is always so hospitable and helpful, and the cozy guest quarters have everything you need from extra storage, hangers, and the the little amenities I love at hotels like mini shampoos or a hairdryer and an iron, just incase you forgot yours! ;) The location is perfect - close to Central Park and subway stations. There's a deli just downstairs that has all groceries you could need for a visit. Coffee shops and cafes are all around in the charming Upper West Side! Her apartment feels like my home away from home when I'm in NYC now. Thanks for everything Mena! Hope to see you again soon!

The subways are just 2 blocks away in both directions  as well as buses. The space is cozy with a great bed, TV, racks to hang clothing as well as a working kitchen to cook your own food. It is a classic NYC walk up, so don't expect modern fixtures, simply indulge in the prewar charm. Mena is a very accommodating hostess dedicated to the happiness of her guests.

Ela foi super atenciosa com a gente na chegada, ela atrasou um pouco a entrega do apartamento, porém deixou a gente deixar as malas antes mesmo do combinado. Mas tivemos um pequeno desconforto durante a locação. Alugamos o apartamento inteiro, e era a primeira vez dela, ela sempre está acostumada a alugar o quarto. Então ela falou pra gente que se precisasse de roupa a mais pro trabalho, iria nos avisar com antecendência, para não nos deixar supresos. Ela foi de fato 2 vezes, avisando, porem apareceu mais 2 vezes sem nos avisar, uma pra pegar roupa e outra, na nossa vespera de saida, para arrumar para os proximos hospedes, e ainda tomou banho. Ficamos sem graça e bem surpreso. Sabemos que não foi por maldade, mas não ficamos 100% confortáveis e a vontade num apartamento, que é o espírito do Airbnb.

The apartment is within walking distance (short and easy) from multiple subway stops, Central Park, shopping areas, great restaurants, Trader Joe's and the Museum of Natural History...the Met is right across the park as well. Mena is super knowledge about the area and recommended great food options, offered traveling advice etc. \n2. Check in and check out was simple, Mena was flexible with meeting to coordinate keys and always reachable via text/phone call if a question came up. She was also very accommodating when I added a last-minute guest to my stay.\n3. The apartment is comfortable and clean. I felt like I had my own personal and private space, which I was worried about before hand because of the curtain divider described online. It was not an issue for me. On the note, Mena is quite enjoyable to live with! She made coffee and tee every morning with breakfast. Very sweet. \nOverall I enjoyed my stay very much and would 100% recommend to other Airbnb users. I will be on the look out for Mena's next time I need a place to stay in NYC.

The bed was very comfortable and I felt very safe at her place. I slept very well. It reminded me of my college days just having a roommate and that was fun if you're into that vibe. There was some noise at night from a band as others said, but it didn't bother me. I guess my long days of training and yoga practice helped me zone it out or I used it to help me sleep since it's pretty muffled and the hum of the fans in the apartment helped drown it out and clear my head. Maybe bring ear plugs or listen to something on your phone that's relaxating if you're worried about it being a bother. The \"room\" had towels, and was all made up and ready so I felt welcomed. Mena also bought some bottled water for me (though the tap tasted fine too). The location is amazing.

I simply love the Upper West Side, within walking distance to Central Park, lots of restaurants around and public transportation right next door to get you anywhere in the city within no time! I’m already looking forward staying with Mena in the not so far future and really hope to be back very very soon .... I miss that comfy bed a lot! Thank you, Mena ... you are the best!!!!!"},{"_id":"290525811","date":{"$date":"2018-07-14T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2210041","reviewer_id":"164598350","reviewer_name":"Mark","comments":"the location is amazing and Mena is a fantastic host.

I felt so comfortable in her place. The curtains go from floor to the very high ceilings so I could have as much or as little privacy as I wanted. I was a little worried about noise from the club nearby so I brought earplugs, but I never even thought about using them.  Mena has a busy schedule too so for the most part, I felt as if I had the place to myself. The location is fantastic. Green spaces nearby, super easy subway access, and so many restaurants within a few blocks. I will definitely stay with Mena again.

Bed was not ready, I helped to do it (blood on the mattress) .. bathroom was suppose to be private but I had to share it with the host. Bathtub had been announced to be old. Old would have been ok: it was even more dirty.. curtains not to mention. In the morning I wanted to have some coffee : I couldn’t use microwave as there was a very old cup inside - didn’t want to go further. No WiFi as expected - no air conditioning (even if I don’t like it) the repair guy was supposed to come the day after (surprisingly) Anyway! Mena looks friendly, but I’m surprised nobody complained about the quality (clean) of this apartment. $110/night + cleaning fee is clearly not a bargain when it is that dirty and non as expected. Make a super big clean-up first and then make this apt available again.

I phoned the phone number associated with Mena's account and it was out of order. I emailed her direct, again nothing. \n\nI now got in touch with Airbnb in a state of confusion and panic. They tried to reach her by phone and via messaging. They could not get through. I was advised by Airbnb to seek a local hotel which I duly did after a 30 mins walk. The cost was $289. Airbnb refunded my reservation but are now saying I can only get back $100, despite not mentioning this in a previous message. \n\n9 days after my visit, I still have no explanation of what happened from the host.

We were told to arrive later than check in and even with accommodating, we came to an unmade bed with stained sheets. However, the bed was made when we came back from dinner a few hours later. We were not given a tour, offered coffee or tea as described, or clean towels until the early morning when we were heading out to the airport. There was no wifi in the apartment as described in the listing which we were depending on to look at directions to places in the area. After coming from another airbnb with a similar price this place did not compare. The location is good for locals, however, given the price there are better accommodations for the same cost."}]}

Communication was super easy.  Adelle was very responsive from booking, to check-in, during my stay and even as I was leaving.  Best location for me.  I needed to mainly be in Brooklyn.  I have stayed in that neighborhood before, so only being a few short blocks to the train was key.  I felt safe, even as a single woman at night, no worries.  The building is secured with 2 locked doors before your private entrance.  The (Website hidden by Airbnb) bright, so clean, everything brand new...I christened several kitchen items, loved that.  If you plan to cook, not to worry, all you need to bring is food.  I mean she has everything!  I do protein shakes every morning, but what were the chances I would find a blender there??  I did find one, it was there...big bonus!  The furnishings were cute, and modern, tastefully decorated, the bed was cozy and comfy, I slept like a baby every night.  I spent time enjoying every room like I was in my own apartment.  Plenty of storage space in closets, hangers, luggage racks, which I love...I was able to hide my belongings so the place didn't look cluttered.  I am a clean freak and the apartment was spotless.  It really looks like the pictures, #nofilter!  I already told Adelle I will be returning soon, so all you people out there, you better book it before I do if you feel like \"Macon Memories\"!!"},{"_id":"236845518","date":{"$date":"2018-02-20T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"22108306","reviewer_id":"134423882","reviewer_name":"Kayla","comments":"Staying with adelle was wonderful!

It is very spacious, so it felt really good to rest there after entire day in an office. I especially enjoyed all the comfort furniture: sofa in the living room, couch and armchairs on the balcony. It is very clean and elegant. It has many different sized lamps, so it is easy to make it well lit in the evenings, whatever's your preference. Especially worth mentioning is the balcony. Even though there is no view to speak of, because the neighbouring buildings block it off as it is only 2nd floor, sitting on the balcony during the weekend or in the evenings was surprisingly relaxing. It is probably due to combination of the facts that the balcony is big, the chairs are very comfortable and the sound of the city is somehow dimmed after everyone left the city center. Speaking of which, the location is absolutely great, it is close to everything I wanted to see in Sydney: Opera House, Ice Cream, Restaurants, Offices, Cafes. And if you want to go there in a fresh shirt, there are very well working appliances in the apartment: washing machine, dryer, and a huge ironing board and a very good iron. I wish I had such in my home. Overall, I highly recommend the apartment."},{"_id":"263817366","date":{"$date":"2018-05-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"22124796","reviewer_id":"117225778","reviewer_name":"Dani","comments":"Tam was super accessible, we never felt like we were a hassle if we needed to ask a question.

The apartment is appointed nicely exactly as advertised.  I found the apartment very quiet and private, and I'm a light sleeper!  The apartment is on the 2nd floor facing away from the street and toward Darling Harbour, but doesn't have much of a view of water - just the Barangaroo buildings.

The apartment building is modern and very safe with a 24/7 concierge. You should be aware that there is major development in this area for the next few years and that it can be noisy with construction work during the day, this was not a major issue for us. The apartment is well furnished and is as it appears in the photos it is up to the standard of a good four star hotel. We found the check in to be a little irksome and the apartment a little lacking in what we would consider to be expectations in a top end property such as additional towels and sufficient toilet rolls for a weeks stay. We also felt there should be a house handbook which is particularly important for overseas visitors not familiar with how the air con and appliances worked as well as providing emergency numbers and location of the local hospital.Whilst none of this spoilt our stay we have passed our comments onto the owners who’ve responded positively."},{"_id":"407656878","date":{"$date":"2019-02-02T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"22124796","reviewer_id":"152034828","reviewer_name":"Craig","comments":"Wonderful location, great layout for the one bedroom apartment with a nice outside deck.

The apartment is also rather confusing to navigate to and had we not had pocket WiFi to (Hidden by Airbnb) Maps the route, the directions provided to us by the host would not have sufficed.

Her place is in one word , beautiful. Everything in both occasions was perfect. The apartment is amazing, very cosy, with 3 bed/ 2 bath, a beautiful and modern kitchen and a very large and cosy living room with a breathtaking view of the ocean. \r\nWe went with our 2 little girls, which are 3 and 4 years old. The condo is perfect for kids since it has a wonderful outdoor playground (just outside the building where Claudia has its apartment) and most of all because of its fun and amazing water slides. Our girls love them!!! \r\nThe condo also has: indoor and of course outdoor pools, 2 tennis courts, indoor gym, a bar/restaurant that's very convenient since you can order whatever you want and they bring it upstairs to the apartment. The location also is perfect. The condo it's between Post 6 and Post 7 of Barra. You have beach service, with chairs and umbrella per each apartment. The beach is beautiful, wide  and white sand beach with a perfect blue sea. The neighbourhood is very nice, you have at 1 block a supermarket and also many bars and restaurant a couple of blocks away. I recommend you rent a car to move free from Barra to wherever you want. Also, if you enjoy kitesurfing, just in front of the Condo there's a kite spot that;s perfect to navigate during windy days.\r\nThe apartment has everything you need to spend a great vacation time. Claudia is an amazing host. Always very helpful and kind! We cant say more nice words about her place!!!!

I loved Biricchino, the District Social wine bar and Gardenia Deli. However, it is important to know what you're getting with Alex's place. This is an Airbnb where the homeowner's personal belongings are still in place and no closet space is available for guests. The rooftop wasn't quite what I envisioned either. Not a place for watching sunsets. There were complications with wifi, no wifi information was initially left, but Alex was supportive and eventually available to resolve this.

The building is just very old. For example, the radiator was insanely loud every time it came on, to the point that it woke us up at night. However, it was impossible not to use it because there was a gap between the window and A/C unit, and a lot of air came in (one day had a low of 4 degrees while we were in NYC). \n\nAnother issue was the kitchen. While there is technically a sink/stove/oven/fridge, there weren't the necessary tools to do any cooking (cutting board, knives, pots, cooking sheets, etc). Part of the reason we wanted to book an Airbnb instead of a hotel was specifically for the use of a kitchen. \n\nOther than those two major issues, there were a few other, smaller things: the bathroom smelled horrible, like vomit, when we first arrived (though the smell did mostly dissipate), the couch is different from the one in the pictures and much smaller, the bedsheets were very cheap and almost plastic-y/slippery feeling, the cabinets were disorganized and messy, and the place generally felt a bit unclean. \n\nI will say that the location is amazing (though not the exact entrance to the apartment, which is a graffitied door next to a Dunkin Donuts and adult DVD store). I do think this would work fine for any one who's just looking for a place to crash for a night or two in the heart of Manhattan."},{"_id":"408134073","date":{"$date":"2019-02-03T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"22144662","reviewer_id":"62167594","reviewer_name":"Megan","comments":"Alex is so sweet and responsive, the only thing was the heater wasn’t working on the coldest day in years in NY and it took all day to get a replacement.

It comes with free covered parking — a MUST when staying in Downtown Honolulu as parking is very limited or very expensive. It is walking distance to just about everything you need — Walmart, Long Drugs, Walgreens, McDonald’s, etc. Restaurants nearby are yummy like Marukame Udon and the Pig \u0026 the Lady (recommended by Angela). The unit also comes with a kitchenette and living room! Bed is comfy too! Waikiki strip is a short driving distance (10-15 mins) from Angela’s unit, very convenient! \n\nMy girlfriend had a little trouble getting into the unit and called Angela and she picked up on the first ring! My girlfriend eventually got into the unit with Angela’s help. Angela even gifted us with a bottle of wine upon entry, so thoughtful and well-needed after spending hours in the plane. Angela was prompt when answering any questions we had through Airbnb app. She even sent us some suggestions and recommendations for food and things to do around the area which we found very helpful! \n\nIn short, look no further and book now as this is truly a hidden gem and amazing and a great value for its price! 10/10, would stay here again if we get the chance (:"},{"_id":"231150670","date":{"$date":"2018-01-30T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"22148252","reviewer_id":"164796257","reviewer_name":"Shaun","comments":"Great location in downtown with off street parking, a huge benefit.

I stayed at her place for 2 night with my parents and fiance and we were satisfied. The apt was clean and equipped with basic kitchen appliances and bathroom supplies (enough towels for all us \u0026 soap). \n\nWe let my parents use the bedroom and slept on the pull out couch (transforms into a bed), and it was surprisingly comfortable. During our stay, we were able to cook a quick breakfast (egg, coffee, tea, ramen) using the kitchen appliances provided and that was very nice. \n\nThere is a designated parking spot for this unit in the parking garage of the building. It was a bit of hassle to go in and out of the garage as the parking spot is on the 8th floor but this is far better than looking for a free parking around this area as parking is always hard in downtown.  \n\nI recommend Angela's place to any couple or family looking for a comfortable place to stay in downtown Honolulu.

She’s super organized with her detailed information that she provides in preparing you for your stay and checks in with you in a timely manner prior to checking in and out of the unit. Angela notified me that she’d be out of the country during my stay and provided me with a back up contact, but still managed to make herself available throughout the time I was in Hawaii. \n\nI loved the laminated visuals she left on the kitchen counter outlining all detailed information pertaining to the unit, in addition to recommended places to visit. The unit appeared just as it did in the photos, if not better. In the exact words of my toddler walking into the bedroom, “This is amaaaaazing!” \n\nLocation is also very convenient. Ross, Longs, and Walgreens are all right downstairs, along with other cafes and small restaurants all short walking distances away. My daughter and I had fun strolling down to Aloha tower to capture views from the deck, and on another day walked to Iolani Palace and continued all the way down to Kaka’ako Waterfront Park (that walk was a bit of a stretch, but we did it). \n\nThank you, Angela!

The description of how to park the vehicle and get the parking pass wasn’t correct. There was no assistant to assist in getting a temp parking pass and when I asked they stated all you had to do was park in your assigned spot, go get your parking pass from your room and put it in the car and toss the ticket you get from the automated ticket booth as you won’t have to pay when you leave since you’ll have your pass to scan. The condo was so lovely, and the views are better than photos can show. It was modern and beautiful. We did have a few issues with the local homeless community who would yell while we walked by and one night a man yelled outside from 3 am for several hours. We should have called the police but we weren’t sure what good that would do. The bed is also very very squeaky and any small movement like waking up to go the bathroom or simply rolling over would wake myself our my partner up. One night we debated sleeping on the futon just so we could have a quite night sleep. Overall the views are so amazing I feel like it really won us over. We loved waking up the sunrise over the mountains. The host Angela was amazing! She assured us our concerns were valid and would be addressed and checked in with us during our stay.

He set the temperature 78 first night, when I tell him about it he told me to open the door.then ignored me if that would change tomorrow, I have to message him trough Airbnb to get a respond from him next day I had no sleep that night, he tell me  he will set it to 65 for the rest of my stay, but  only let it for two days change it to 76, I only had two days of sleep. \n\nThe  stairs is very slippery I fall in front of him mess up my pants, had a cut in my elbow he didn't even asked me if I was okay. Then tell me he didn't hear or saw anything after he made eyes contact with me. He ignored some of my message I had to send the same massage trough Airbnb to get a reply from him.\nI think the host need to be honest about they place just like they have they rules for the house.

It’s very accessible from Sydney but gives the feeling of being far away from it all. The location is great being just a short drive from several beaches, shops, cafes etc. The house is incredibly well equipped with everything you can think of and the host went out of their way to provide helpful information and little touches which made us feel very at home. It’s a very sociable home with several eating and entertaining spots in the house: an upper balcony \u0026 bbq overlooking the treetops and ocean as well as a lower deck, dining table and bbq area downstairs. The garden is private and the pool area lovely for lounging around under a shady tree.
