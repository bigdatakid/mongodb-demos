Le système d'ouverture par code est top (pas besoin d'avoir RV avec l'hôte, ni à l arrivée ce qui est pratique quand on arrive tard comme nous,  ni au départ et pas de stress de perdre les clés) . Il est également très calme, au 1er étage, il ne donne pas sur la rue (vue sur des toits des habitations voisines..) la déco est sympa, la literie impeccable, la propreté irréprochable, les serviettes fournies, les équipements pour manger sont ok (mais attention pas de sel sucre , trucs de base non fourni) , le wi-fi fonctionne nickel.

You're within walking distance (15-20 min) to Waikiki beach, which is great as you can leave your car rental at the place. The parking spot was great too- never having to worry about finding parking is a luxury. The place itself was a good size for 2- would be really tight for 4. The bed was fairly comfortable, decor was warming and tasteful, and the kitchen amenities are minimal but you can definitely prep meals and cook. There is oil, pepper, salt -- nice not having to purchase those types of things. There were also 2 beach towels which is amazing. \n\nClaude was a really good host - there were admittedly a few minor hiccups in our first couple nights, but Claude was very quick to respond (literally within an hour) and on top of it! I would recommend staying at his place if visiting Oahu, it's a great spot to make trips out to various beaches along the coast and offers a comfortable and safe stay!"},{"_id":"169522724","date":{"$date":"2017-07-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18112116","reviewer_id":"89332861","reviewer_name":"Erica","comments":"Great location!

It's more like a 30-40 minute walk to Waikiki - the good part of the beach and strip. 20 min walk to the sheltered baby area. Amenities like shampoo/conditioner amd dish soap were good, but missing things like kleenex and laundry soap. I feel laundry soap shoukd be provided especially wheb only one kitchen cloth was provided and we stayed for 7 days. At checkin  we didn't know where to park the car. The checkin instructions just had entry instructions and wifi pass. Literally nothing else, so our 11pm checkin wasn't awesome. Had to wake up the Host.  I wouldn't reccomend this place for more than 2 people. It's too small for more. Perfect for 2 though. The bathroom door is more like like a closet door, it's a sliding for with not much noise protection. May bother some shy people. Also a very tiny bathroom so if you're a heavy person you'll have trouble getting in and it of shower and up off the toilet. Air conditioning was good. Two units. However it's useless when cooking.  the oven/stove throws so much heat it's instantly 90 degrees in the living room.

We didn't plan on cooking at our Airbnb but there were a handful of popular local restaurants that were walking distance like Side Street Inn and Uncle Bo's which was a plus and also Waikiki was less than a 5 minute drive. The place was also very clean and furniture was up to date. The A/C definitely came in handy and I would definitely recommend staying here if you're looking for a place near Waikiki.

First off, check in was a breeze ! My boyfriend and I walked into a super cute, very clean and pristine little place with the ac already on and blasting for us ! I previously lived on the the island close to Claude's residence and I can tell you that it is top of the line ! Guaranteed you will not find anything better for the price, cleanliness, amenities and location. Yes, the bathroom is a little small but it gets the job done. You shouldn't come all the way to Hawaii to hangout in a bathroom anyways. Now if you rented a car you have a prime parking spot (AMEN) which saves you not only a headache but money as well (parking in Waikiki can be stressful and expensive). Parking is key people !!!! The residence is tucked away towards the back of he units, we didn't run into any of our neighbors nor did we hear them either. You have a great kitchen with plenty of utensils but I would check in first and then hit the Safeway that is conveniently located down the street (in case you need something not provided). The TV with the Roku was a super nice extra to have. After being in the sun all day, put your feet up, blast that AC and turn on the Hulu and you're in for a relaxing evening. Unless, you were looking to take a short walk to Waikiki to hit the restaurants and bars (which is also what we did frequently). Coffee was provided but there is a Starbucks around the corner too if you want that instead ! Also, provided for us was detergent for the washer and dryer. Such a nice touch we felt so spoiled. I thanked Claude after check in and reached out to him at check out and always got a quick response. There were zero issues to report to him so we didn't get to chat as much but really isn't that a good thing while your on vacay? A nice, reliable place to stay? I'm gonna be sad if I forget anything but this is already long enough! Claude thank you again! This is our new go to spot to stay on the island, we appreciated our stay and host so much !"},{"_id":"204379133","date":{"$date":"2017-10-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18112116","reviewer_id":"82673246","reviewer_name":"Cheryl","comments":"This was a small place but in an excellent location to get to Waikiki Beach and all the things to do in Honolulu.

The house is all the way to the end of the second building. It’s very private and very quiet. The house was very clean and it’s so bright and airy. There were more than enough towels provided as well as blankets. If you do have a car try to park as close as you can to the wood fence, so you don’t block the way of the other tenants. We were walking distance from the beach and the zoo. There is also the famous rainbow diner just down the street. It’s true that location is key.

There was a parking slot right in the driveway in front of the place but it was sort of annoying cause someone was always “visiting” people in the front units that a car was always there. They had no issues moving at all every time but when you have a toddler asleep and just wanna get them inside it gets tedious after the first couple of times. Very basic inside no table to sit and eat at but we didn’t mind as we didn’t eat much there anyway. We did have an issue with some people next door they came in yelling and loud around 11:30 pm I messaged Claude that night and woke up to him letting me know it was taken care of and apologized which was great.

The loft is quite compact but very functional and beautiful, it worked perfectly for me.

The host was very responsive from the very beginning of the booking and arranged for his kind neighbour to check us in on our first day. The property is incredibly spacious (even bigger than it looks in the pictures), spotlessly clean and full of lovely details, you will feel like home in no time. The location is ideal for exploring around Hilo and secluded for a peaceful rest after a day out hiking and enjoying the area. The garden with the pond was a great touch and we enjoyed all the night sounds from the surrounding nature. Jim was very welcoming and offered to help with anything we may need for our stay.

Board games and the pool table were a hit at night!  Host was quick to respond to any questions and requests.  Close to the tidepools and the Maku'u market (love it!).  It's a bit far from restaurants and shops (30 min each way) but the kitchen has everything you need to make an easy meal.  It's a huge place for the 4 of us!  Just note that they don't have a dryer.

Jim's place truly lives up to its name, Old School Hospitality. There are plenty of resources and amenities. The kitchen is well stocked with everything you need to cook a decent meal (gas cooking, too).  The bed linens are soft, beds comfortable; sparkling clean everywhere. We didn't have to buy shampoo and soap like in other rentals, because a generous amount was provided for the four of us. The fish pond with waterlilies in front of the patio is gorgeous, and one can hear the coqui and bull frogs at night with their enchanting concerto. \n A good place for snorkeling nearby is Richardson Beach Park. The beach is rocky, but there is live coral reef close to shore with a decent amount of fish, including schools of yellow tangs.  We have also seen sea turtles galore at the same place. For places to shop and dine, you can either look online or use Jim's  info for guests (look for a blue binder) which includes very useful local tips. \nOverall, we were very pleased with this rental and would stay there again.

There is also a petrol kiosk abt 2-3mins walk with a 24hr convenience store which was good if you need to get stuff urgently. Mascot train station is barely 5mins walk from the apartment and it takes you everywhere into the city which is abt 3 stops away. There are plenty of eateries outside the train station you can choose from, and there’s a Halal Thai eatery serving good food as well as a Kebab store and also an Indian cuisine place, to name a few, which was a plus for us considering we are Muslim. There’s also a big Woolsworth for you to shop across the station. Evan’s place is huge, very comfortable and very clean! Great to relax after a long day out on the huge and comfy sofa!

Faz divisa com os bairros de Copacabana, Leblon e Lagoa. Etimologia O nome dado pelos índios Ipanema significa \"água ruim, rio sem peixes\" em tupi-guarani. O nome faz referência a uma região em Sorocaba, onde José Antônio Moreira Filho ((PHONE NUMBER HIDDEN)), feito segundo barão de Ipanema em 1847 (e conde em 1868), tinha uma metalúrgica. Nessa mesma região, havia a Real Fábrica de Ferro São João do Ipanema, aos pés do Morro de Ipanema. Era um minerador e comprou as terras onde hoje está localizado o bairro carioca e decidiu homenagear seu local de nascimento, a vila de São João de Ipanema, hoje pertencente a cidade de Iperó.

There was a bottle of wine when we arrived which was a very nice gesture. And the apartment has air conditioning which was really handy for this time of year. It does work and does a good job at cooling down the apartment especially for sleeping. It was quite noisy around there - people running up and down the stairs at night and there was a large air conditioning unit outside the window that made a lot of noise. I use ear plugs so it was ok - but light sleepers might struggle without. If you want an apartment which is near everything and use it mainly for sleeping then this is a good option. The kitchen is very basic - we didnt cook anything in there as it was quite limited. The restaurant right next door (Pedro dos frangos) is affordable and very tasty food - although be prepared for not the best service.

Danielle's place definitely seems more like you are staying with her family in their primary residence since there is no separate (Website hidden by Airbnb) Danielle escorted me in through the living room to the basement stairs, her sweet Mom was cooking a nice meal in the kitchen which is where the downstairs door and guest bathroom both are situated....again a more personal interaction than most AirBnBs but a nice human element.  The home is impeccably decorated throughout...very beautiful.\n\nThe bedroom is the comfiest stay I've had with a small but good quality bed and a ducted a/c unit that cooled it down nicely.  Great touches like nice iron/board, snacks/water, maps, etc.  Only caveat is that when Danielle puts the adjective \"small\" in her listing title she isn't being conservative....this room is quite tiny and not a place you can do much than fall into bed, but it's a great cool quiet rest environment!  WiFi is very fast....bathroom upstairs is nice but small with no counter space but again lots of nice touches like complimentary soaps, shampoos and even shave cream, aftershave, qtips, etc.\nIn total, Danielle has put much thought and personal pride into this (Website hidden by Airbnb) was by far the nicest quality room and overall home I've tried in the close-to-LGA Astoria listings.  If you don't need much room space and just a nice sleep environment, this listing can't be beat!"},{"_id":"159715769","date":{"$date":"2017-06-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18173787","reviewer_id":"89953354","reviewer_name":"Tegan","comments":"Danielle and her family were so lovely and welcoming.

We could use the kitchen as well as the living room. The ride to Manhattan may take 45-60 minutes each way, bus Q49 runs frequently (Q19 less), also through the night. Danielle and her parents were very friendly and I especially liked the presence of the 2 cats and 3 little dogs. Personally I was less happy to have received for my second stay a room without a window (basically for the same price as a room with window), which made me feel a bit claustrophobic. I would have preferred one of the other three rooms having been rented. The Middle East restaurants at Steinway Street in Q are reached within a 10-minute bus ride, so is bustling Flushing.

The room I stayed in was cute and clean, but being in the basement and having no air circulation prior to my arrival meant that the room felt stuffy and a little claustrophobic. This didn't really make my stay an unpleasant experience though, as I was only there for a few hours. I would have felt differently had I slept there for multiple nights.

Danielle took care of every small detail and was very prompt with her replies. The check-in instructions were unambiguous and very easy to follow. My stay was very comfortable and I wouldn't hesitate to come back, if I went visiting the queens area again."},{"_id":"190169388","date":{"$date":"2017-09-03T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18173787","reviewer_id":"9765493","reviewer_name":"Eric","comments":"A perfect place to stay with a great deal!

I'm a wide set person but don't require much square footage overall so was a good match for me. Only thing on the wish list that could be done with the space is weather proofing the door. It would keep the hall light out for light sensitive people like me. Also would allow better temperature control inside the room and reduce noise a bit. I didn't find either to be a particular problem though. The footsteps upstairs got obnoxious from time to time but weather proofing wouldn't help there.

It is clean, it is cozy, it is a home away from home. this place is absolutely amazing especially for the price. Not included in the price are 2 very cute and social cats that you can pet and play with. The shower and bedroom are immaculate and it cannot be stated how just charming and clean it is.  I would love to have stayed here more but alas there was only one night available and the location was fairly far away from where I needed to be. But if given the chance I would totally stay here again.

There were beautiful sunsets every night, setting right over Molokai. We enjoyed our breakfasts on the patio every morning. There are free yoga classes on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday mornings and free Mai tais on Thursday afternoon's by the pool. You can also see a free hula show next door at the pink hotel on Wednesday evenings. The location was great, very near Black Rock and Lahaina. The condo was beautifully remodeled and very well equipped. We were extremely comfortable.  I really loved being on the ground floor, it felt like the whole lawn outside of the  condo was our personal lounging area and so close to the snorkeling!!!  Loved it. ( I would like to see the extra fees included in the price on the Airbnb website.  One of the things I like about Airbnb is that it is usually extremely concise and straightforward when renting a spot. Printing, signing and sending the rental agreement seemed like an unnecessary hassle, as one is already a component of renting on Airbnb.)"},{"_id":"206502347","date":{"$date":"2017-10-25T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18173803","reviewer_id":"102062946","reviewer_name":"Avery","comments":"The host canceled this reservation 125 days before arrival.

Loved the welcome bag and the macadamia nuts. Unit is very modern and clean. The snorkeling outside the unit is great- made friends with a sea turtle who just wants to chill during the day under a falling palm tree. Parking was great and included with resort fee. The Fish Market is within walking distance and delicious. Uber was our best friends and took us everywhere for 30$ approximately round trip- highly recommend Monkeypod and Feast at LeLe. A trip to Costco \u0026 Target when you land is a must especially with the fridge and freezer at the condo. So many turtles and so little time. I recommend the 30 minute drive to the blowhole followed by lunch at the SeaHouse and then snorkeling at the beach to the right of it- chilled with 3 turtles that day! The condo has beach chairs, boogeyboards, and a cooler. When we went to target we got a bag of ice and some of the lunch box coolers we love growing up to put in our cooler.

The location is perfect; the condo is basically an end unit, right on the water, and just a short drive away from any westside activities, attractions, and restaurants. Tina goes the extra mile by setting up the condo with everything you can imagine, including a starter set of everything you’ll need for laundry/dishes, boogie boards and other water necessities, and anything you’ll need for cooking. You also get a welcome gift and beautiful flowers upon arrival!\n\nWhile the weather was pretty hot during our stay, the window unit in the living room quickly cooled down the entire unit. The only slight downsides were some grouchy long-term residents/board members who seemed a bit unwelcoming to those of us renting and a bit of a walk back to the condo if you park later at night (but no longer than if you stayed at a hotel and parked in their garage).\n\nOverall, the gorgeous space, convenient location, and tons of amenities in the unit easily make this a five star, highly recommended rental!"},{"_id":"345971539","date":{"$date":"2018-11-06T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18173803","reviewer_id":"63002435","reviewer_name":"Patrick","comments":"Great condo in the perfect location.

Esperienza positiva da tutti i punti di vista, Jess è stata davvero molto disponibile ed accogliente, ci ha fatto anche rimanere fino al tardo pomeriggio l'ultimo giorno appena ha saputo che gli ospiti successivi sarebbero arrivati molto tardi. A voler essere pignoli, forse la pulizia dell'appartamento non era proprio il massimo, ma niente di così terribile. L'unica mancanza, comunque segnalata nell'annuncio, è che non ci sono né lavastoviglie né lavatrice/ asciugatrice. Forse per periodi medio/ lunghi di permanenza ciò può dare problemi.

We HIGHLY RECOMMEND this apartment and Ylza as a host.  We enjoyed our stay completely and would DEFINITELY stay again!  Her apartment is VERY clean and VERY secure; locked gated front building entrance with 24 hour doorman, and a lock on your own bedroom door too (but we never even locked our door).  Bathroom is very clean and has plenty of hot water for showers. GREAT location! The apartment is in the first block from the beach - VERY close easy walking distance to Copacabana beach!  Bus stops and Metro stops are very easy walking distance.  Ipanema Beach and Lake also within a little longer walking distance.  On Sunday mornings there is a fantastic farmer's market right on Ylza's block at the park.  Her dog and cats are loving and sweet.  You MUST like animals to stay here - they are very affectionate and want to be with you.  We loved that!  The only potential negative for someone would be that there is no air conditioning - so if you get hot easily, you will not like that.  My husband and I don't mind the heat - we were not uncomfortable.  But if you need A/C, this is not the place for you.  Travel from the airport to Copacabana in a taxi is approximately $30 - $35USD.

The place is very close to Copacabana beach (2 min walking) and full of restaurants, bars, markets, etc. Our bedroom was pretty comfortable, with a big and nice bed. Bathroom was a little bit small, but it was always clean and very well equipped. Living room was big, with 2 nice couches, great illumination and good music. \nYlza lives with Vranca and Blu (cat and dog, respectively). Both animals are well domesticated and they were always friendly with us. \nWe encourage to you to visit Ylza at Rio.\nBest,\n\nCarlos and Victoria"},{"_id":"124994590","date":{"$date":"2017-01-03T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"182139","reviewer_id":"73221773","reviewer_name":"Daiana","comments":"Ylza es una gran anfitriona!

They made sure that we felt welcomed and at home. We arrived earlier than check in and since the room was ready our hosts graciously allowed us access. The bathroom was very clean and so was the shower. The room had AC (thank goodness because it was VERY hot and humid during our stay!). Tomas and Julia kept the room stocked with coffee and cookies. We brought yogurt and granola bars and trail mix and kept them in the fridge so they wouldn't melt from the heat. All in all, our hosts were very kind and attentive.\n\nOne thing I will note though, is the street was undergoing construction that we were not notified about. On the day we arrived, crews had just started stripping off the top layer of asphalt on the street and were preparing to finish and redo all new asphalt over the duration of our stay. Host rules dictated that we were to park on the street, which was no longer possible, so we had to park around the corner and down the block (or risk having our car towed if we didn't wake up at 7am to move the car before construction started for the day). As we usually left around 8am and didn't come back until late in the evening, it wasn't too much of an issue, but we would have definitely appreciated a heads up. \n\nOutside of that, our hosts were pretty cool. Julia even gave us directions to find some tidepools we've been looking for on the east side of the island. All in all, I would recommend a stay with our hosts."},{"_id":"171154589","date":{"$date":"2017-07-16T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18215500","reviewer_id":"1859350","reviewer_name":"Sung","comments":"I had a great stay in their beautiful home.

The place is small and well maintained. While there is AC in the room, I was advised twice within the first ten minutes of arrival of the “rules” for using it despite it being near 90 inside the home. \n\nThe host, who were not Tomas and Lucas as advertised, attempted to tell me “ things are done differently here in Hawaii” which may have worked but because multi generations of my family have lived on island for years, I know that to be false. \n\nAs a local visitor, I was disappointed in how unwelcoming we were made to feel. So much so that my sister left early to just stay at home; why stick around to be reminded of the shoe policy or to keep the bedroom doors closed at all times. \n\nAt one point, the female host even told my sister she would be charged $50 for having her infant daughter with her, something that we had inquired about prior to arrival. I tried to call Air bnb to cancel the remaining night because it simply was not enjoyable or worth the expense and they were not helpful in the slightest. I’ve used this service countless times in many areas including Hawaii and have never had an experience quite like this one. It saddens me because I raved to family how great the service is but in this case, not so much. \n\nI have an affinity for the area and I hope others will find a welcoming place to experience the aloha of the islands but this place wasn’t it for us at least. \n\nMost importantly, a major hurricane was scheduled to hit the island during our visit. It would have been humane for the hosts to offer some support but we heard nothing from them. Again, Airbnb was useless and offered no advice.

I followed the instructions in the chat from the host and was looking for door with a keypad to enter a code. Upon found the door, the keypad was not visible. It looked like a hotel door that you need a magnetic card to activate. I thought I thought it was the wrong door. I spent quite a while hunting around the building. I called the host but the call went straight to voicemail. I texted her and messaged her through chat but still nothing. I had to call Airbnb. It was impossible to tell from the instructions that the trackpad was digital. Finally Airbnb was able to contact the host and the matter was resolved. The host sent me a link to a six page website which I hadn't read all the way through but read thoroughly once I checked in. The room was small and clean. It’s at a very low price point so I wasn’t expecting the Four Seasons. It would have been nice if the sheets and towels were fresher and better quality but everything else was good.  As an expat male who’s lived in Asia for almost 30 years, it didn’t bother me to discover that the building is kinda one big brothel with prostitutes working out of small flats throughout. As a result, the lift and lobby attracts a lot of shady punters. I felt safe but if you're female or new to Asia, I wouldn’t recommend it. The flat was quiet, cozy and everything worked. Location is excellent so that made up for the initial inconvenience. I would happily come back for a short stay."},{"_id":"350699834","date":{"$date":"2018-11-20T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18215903","reviewer_id":"213461418","reviewer_name":"Gayle","comments":"I found out the bldg was a brothel in the lower floors which made it quite uncomfortable for me because I’m a female.

I asked if there was a receptionist or someone who can watch over the things that we would leave behind because it is my first time to stay at a condo/ arbnb in HK. She replied “there’s no reservation dear” which was not helpful at all. We waited 30 mins outside the door (thinking the door was for our room only). Good thing someone went out and let us in. He said there’s more than 1 room inside that door. A filipino cleaner welcomed us and that’s when I understood what she meant by “hallway”. There were 3-4 units inside with small kitchen, etc. She was so helpful and that’s when we started to feel comfortable. Room was clean, small but well ventilated. Everything we needed was there also.

There are plenty of bars, restaurants and supermarkets just in a 3' walk.","notes":"The bedroom's window is open towards the street, and although it is not a traffic dense area, you may hear some traffic noise. In case you'd be ultra sensitive to noise, ear plugs would be recommended.","transit":"The neighborhood is very well connected trough bus lines (H14, V27, 92) and tube (L4 - Llacuna station). Anyway, as BCN is a rather small city with plenty of nice views, getting to city centre by foot would also be a perfect option to start getting familiar with it. Public transportation is available from El Prat airport and from bus and train stations.Otherwise, taxi would be an option (aprox. 35€ day-fare from the airport).","access":"All rooms are really big and spacious. There are two bedrooms (one of them is my own bedroom), a huge living room, an entry room connected to the big kitchen and to my studio. There is only one bathroom.","interaction":"I live in the flat myself, so the common facilities of the apartment will be shared with me.  There are no animals, and you can expect stay in a tidy flat with a very chilling atmosphere.  The main reason I started with airbnb is to get the chance to meet interesting new people and to enjoy the cultural exchange in hosting, also sharing my experience of the city in order to help you getting outside of tourist main-stream places. So I hope my presence will be a plus to enjoy BCN at its best!","house_rules":"","property_type":"Apartment","room_type":"Private room","bed_type":"Real Bed","minimum_nights":"2","maximum_nights":"1125","cancellation_policy":"moderate","last_scraped":{"$date":"2019-03-08T05:00:00.000Z"},"calendar_last_scraped":{"$date":"2019-03-08T05:00:00.000Z"},"first_review":{"$date":"2017-06-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"last_review":{"$date":"2019-02-04T05:00:00.000Z"},"accommodates":2,"bedrooms":1,"beds":1,"number_of_reviews":22,"bathrooms":{"$numberDecimal":"1.0"},"amenities":["TV","Wifi","Kitchen","Paid parking off premises","Smoking allowed","Washer","Essentials","Shampoo","Hangers","Hair dryer","Iron","Laptop friendly workspace","translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_49","Hot water","Bed linens","Extra pillows and blankets","Patio or balcony","Luggage dropoff allowed","Long term stays allowed","Host greets you"],"price":{"$numberDecimal":"52.00"},"security_deposit":{"$numberDecimal":"0.00"},"cleaning_fee":{"$numberDecimal":"0.00"},"extra_people":{"$numberDecimal":"7.00"},"guests_included":{"$numberDecimal":"1"},"images":{"thumbnail_url":"","medium_url":"","picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b8e4ebbc-d8d8-483d-8b86-b7f9efc640a9.jpg?aki_policy=large","xl_picture_url":""},"host":{"host_id":"40211677","host_url":"https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/40211677","host_name":"Sofia","host_location":"Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain","host_about":"Hi!

The accommodations were extremely clean and spacious!! This unit had a very well stocked kitchen, two large bedrooms with ample closet space and a very large bathroom in each, and a comfortable deck that overlooked the golf course with views of the ocean in the distance. Our daily morning walk started with a visit to the village center, about a ten minute walk, for coffee and whatever else we may need. We then ventured to the beach access entrance, which is just across the street from the complex entrance. There you will find a well established path along the oceanside with beautiful beaches. In addition to the ocean, there were several dining and happy hour options within walking distance and many more within a short drive. We especially enjoyed the overall quiet atmosphere."},{"_id":"257085266","date":{"$date":"2018-04-24T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18237857","reviewer_id":"101628791","reviewer_name":"Chris","comments":"I can’t recommend this location enough. Everything about it is exactly what you want in a Hawaiian getaway. First, the location. If you’re not familiar with Kapalua, it is in my opinion the best part of the island. Beautiful sandy beaches and much less crowded than other parts of the island. The only down side is it’s quite far from the airport and to the road to Hana, but, hey, the drive is gorgeous every time so this was not a problem for us at all. Another spectacular detail, you are within walking distance of the ritz. BUT, the ritz offers free valet, so feel free to drive over and go to one of there many fantastic restaurants and don’t expect to pay. You can also access there pool by renting a day bed for $200 a day or by arranging a massage. Everything was very simple to set up at the ritz. Fantastic hospitality. You can also just drive over and walk down to the beautiful beach right in front of the ritz, or just simply walk to the beach from the villa (about 5-10 walk - also a beautiful hike right along the coast if you’re up for it). Now, on to the villa. First, you have a designated parking space that is right in front of the villa on the ground level. Second, the communication with the host was outstanding. We had one minor issue with the ice machine in the fridge, and they came over and fixed it immediately. Every amenity is included just as advertised. Many towels, and soap and shampoo all throughout. Also, the space is huge. You can easily fit two couples and one extra person to stay in the living room. The bathrooms are huge and have giant beautiful tubs. The water pressure was amazing! Finally, the view is breathtaking. From one of the bedrooms you can actually walk right out on to the grass and head down to the beach. From the living room is a raised balcony with outstanding ocean views. The pictures don’t do this place justice. It feels bigger in person. The kitchen was very clean and well stocked. One concern I had going in was the AC. There is only an AC in both bedrooms... but you don’t really even need the AC. We were more than comfortable opening the doors and enjoying the cool breezes all day and night (with the screen doors shut to keep out the bugs of course). Two quick points of interest. The Kapalua Zipline tour is right next to the villa. My girlfriend and I did the 7 line course and really enjoyed it. So beautiful and so much fun! Also, the Honolua General store is also right next to the villa. They have everything you would need, plus they serve outstanding breakfast and lunch with a nice little patio deck. If you stay here, you must go to sensei sushi which is also very close to the villa. Best sushi..."},{"_id":"267810438","date":{"$date":"2018-05-22T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18237857","reviewer_id":"75464082","reviewer_name":"Jonathan","comments":"Fantastic!

Also since you are right by the board walk (which is beyond convenient if you need to be in this area. It's right near public trans, stores, and highway) however, it gets very loud because of the rides and board walk festivities. The announcer starts pretty early on the loud speaker about prizes and rides etc. So be prepared for an early wake up if your a light sleeper. Other than that you can't beat the price  and the value. The hosts live in the building which makes it convenient if you need something or if something goes wrong.

(Even got an emergency dental problem handled next day, affordably!) All 4 of us made great memories, slept soundly, and saved money by staying with James! (A beer in the backyard did tough competition with going out for a drink!) No concerns about safety; saw some homeless folks sleeping next to the cathedral at night but they were quiet \u0026 respectful. Walks \u0026 (Citibike) bike rides in the park were a highlight of our trip. Large public pool nearby is great for laps, recreation or therapy.

He's fun and interesting to talk to, the bedrooms have all of the amenities needed (beds are comfortable), and the place is clean.  James even made us welcome muffins!!!  How much friendlier of a host do you need?  James' place is also close to the subway and close to Rite Aid which is almost a grocery store where you can get almost anything you'd need.  There are also restaurants in the area which is convenient.  I'd definitely stay here again.  Hopefully, I have enough time to come back and take advantage of the comfy looking backyard!!! =)"},{"_id":"333794401","date":{"$date":"2018-10-07T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18250284","reviewer_id":"184650399","reviewer_name":"Tea Marie","comments":"We really enjoyed our stay in Harlem :) Super nice people and the cutest dog!

Alles war sauber, gut ausgestattet und gemütlich. Zudem konnte man die Küche und das Wohnzimmer mit nutzen, wobei die Gastgeber immer sehr zurückhaltend und meistens auf ihrer Etage waren. Die Lage empfanden wir als richtig gut. Sowohl Subway als auch Fahrradverleih (Citibikes) waren sehr schnell zu erreichen und der Central Park quasi direkt vor der Haustür.

During the end of our stay we had a Hurricane Lane warning - hosts were responsive and prepped all the outdoor furniture, set up sand bags at all ground floor entrances and dropped off some emergency supplies for us (water, flashlights, candles etc.). In the end the hurricane passed us but we appreciated the precautions.  Garden area is very spacious and the 2 year old in our group enjoyed being able to safely run around within the fenced space.

It is hard to locate if you arrive late in the dark! (Like me, as I had a very late arrival time.)  Bert is a very kind and hospitable host, and checks in to see if I need anything or any questions. It was very much appreciated having papaya, bananas, coffee to welcome me! He offers very helpful tips,  quick in responding to any questions.

Ana is a welcoming, helpful and friendly host. She advised us a wonderful bakery just near the flat and some other nice local areas. The apartment was modern, clean and tidy with well equipped kitchen and bathroom. You can open a window or use air conditioner at your own option. \r\nAna even left a bottle of water, cola and Nespresso for our enjoyable stay! \r\nLocation of the apartment is perfect, 7-10 minutes to the centre and metro station.

This was due to the lovely, comfortable and modern apartment and great hosts. Our flight was delayed by 3 hours but Ana and laura were happy to wait for us and told us not to worry. They showed us how everything worked. Ana and laura had bought a wifi box to use during our visit as the system they had was not working. This was very considerate. We were told prior to our visit about places to visit to get a real feel, information about transport and on arrival food places worth a visit.

The apartment studio, with its \"sexy stlyed\" bathroom is perfectly located near the metro, grocery, nightlife and an AMAZING Pastisseria with croissants filled with crema catalana that are heaven on a plate.  They provided coffee for the nespresso maker, which is not normally done in other airbnb spots, and I have to say it was a lovely amenity and MUCH appreciated that I didn't have to go and search for them. A few soft drinks and beers in the fridge as well.

We were there in the high summer heat and the air conditioning was wonderful. The location is o.k., a short walk to the Gaudi houses and there is a nearby bus that takes you to the Gothic Quarter etc. This was one of the more expensive apartments we rented in Spain, but Barcelona is pricey. \r\n\r\nNote: The apartment states it has an elevator (and it does) but there are about 15 stairs to get up to the elevator, which was challenging for my mother who has a bad knee."},{"_id":"38131238","date":{"$date":"2015-07-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1826858","reviewer_id":"33889755","reviewer_name":"Francy","comments":"Ana fue muy atenta con nosotros desde el primer contacto. \nTuvimos oportunidad de conocer también de persona .. es una persona muy amable ... .

She met me at the apartment, and checked in the day afterwards to be sure everything was going ok. \r\n\r\nThe apartment  is exactly as pictured.  It's quite compact (especially the bathroom), and I'd say perfect for a single guest or couple.  The apartment has two a/c units, one in the lounge area and one in the bedroom.  They are powerful and provide plenty of cool air.  The apartment is in the back of the building, and its one window (which is frosted) looks out onto the mechanical equipment and the space between two buildings.  Not at all scenic, but, Carrer d'Arago is a six lane street, and this apartment hears zero street noise; very nice for  peace, quiet and sleeping.   There are two Metro stops about 600 meters from the apartment and from these you can go anywhere.  I mostly walked to the places I wanted to get to, but did use the Metro too.  There was a Barcelona guide book, metro maps, museum information and other tourist info in the apartment.  This was my favorite apartment of the 3 I stayed in while in Europe this summer.  Ana was fantastic, and very responsive, the apartment is exactly what you see, and the location is great.  I'd stay here again without hesitation.\r\n\r\nJust an FYI:  The apartment across the hall is also a vacation rental.  I did hear the people in that apartment, but it is not a reason to not stay here.  I just mention to let anyone know that you may here these neighbors, and don't be surprised.  For the first two nights, no one was in the apartment.  Then I'd hear them during the day and evening, but at night when it was time for bed, all was quiet.  I texted Ana about the neighbors on the first night, and she was super responsive and concerned.  She's a really wonderful host.

The second bed in the apartment is a pull-out couch, which was comfortable enough for our short stay. We were there during a heat wave, and we noticed with the bedroom door closed the bedroom was stuffy, but that was solved the next night by leaving the door open.

It appears no one lives there when it's not inhabited by short term (Airbnb) renters, and that means that there were some things missing that someone living in a place might have been able to offer (i.e., a hairdryer).  Getting into the apartment was a breeze with the no-key entry.  Carole was nice although I didn't meet her in person.  She was  available via text- for the most part.

Only 5mins walk to St Catherine Street and max 20min walk to downtown. \n\nIf I’m back in Montréal I wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again!"},{"_id":"262981618","date":{"$date":"2018-05-10T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18272882","reviewer_id":"170384526","reviewer_name":"Philippe","comments":"Très bon séjour chez Sarah qui est d'une grande disponibilité pour répondre aux questions.

We walked to Old Montreal, all through St Catherine. And everything was close if you didn't mind the walk. Being 10mins from the Bell Centre, which was our main reason for our trip, was amazing.

The building is noticeably old, but the apartment itself is kept clean. There are 3 flights of stairs to climb so I suggest carrying no more than 1 luggage. Very close to Q/B lines and B35 bus stop which is convenient. Close to downtown Brooklyn (15-20 minutes), but about 40-45 minutes from Midtown Manhattan via subway, all depending on the subway's mood. \n\nThere is AC in the living space, which is a must in the in the scorching summer months. Plenty of shelves and closet space for you to use as well. \n \nSoaps and shampoo for showering are not provided, which is unusual for an Airbnb, but it is stated in the listing if you read it carefully. \n\nWhile the kitchen is kept very clean, there are small roaches that often roam around at night. They appear to be mostly German roaches, which are smaller and do not fly. They won't bother you in your living space so it won't be an issue unless you need the kitchen. On rare occasions, you may see one or two near the bathroom sink but only at night. \n"},{"_id":"322580976","date":{"$date":"2018-09-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18293288","reviewer_id":"145618262","reviewer_name":"Melike \u0026 Kadir","comments":"clean room,good people and nearly subway station.sweat home."},{"_id":"328210824","date":{"$date":"2018-09-25T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18293288","reviewer_id":"207924770","reviewer_name":"미영","comments":"Quick response, Great convenience, Clean house, Satisfies! ^^"},{"_id":"331399260","date":{"$date":"2018-10-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18293288","reviewer_id":"54024517","reviewer_name":"Paula","comments":"Everything was exactly as described.

It's in an amazing location... right in the heart of Waikiki. There are so many shops and restaurants within walking distance. You're also practically next door to the International Marketplace. Sure, Waikiki is super touristy, but we were tourists, and the sheer number of quality dining options were overwhelming. It also had an excellent view from the balcony (especially the sunrise!).\n\nThe room was well-stocked and the instructions, while strict, are to the point and easy to understand (check out procedures, wifi, laundry, garbage, etc). We never needed to contact the hosts because the instructions were so thorough. \n\nA couple things to note:\n- You must remove your own trash before you leave. There is a refuse chute on each floor that you can dump your trash down.\n- If you stay here, make sure you remember to remove your shoes before walking into the main living space. There is a basket by the door reminding you to do so.\n- Despite being on the 21st floor, you can still hear the drunken hollering and \"whoo girls\" from the Seaside Bar \u0026 Grill across the street at night. It didn't bother us (sounds of the city), but just something to keep in mind.\n\nWould definitely stay here again!\n"},{"_id":"164837585","date":{"$date":"2017-06-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18294310","reviewer_id":"124047023","reviewer_name":"Akiyama","comments":"中心部に近く､とても動きやすかったです!!!お部屋もｷﾚｲでよかったです｡"},{"_id":"167186794","date":{"$date":"2017-07-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18294310","reviewer_id":"109240669","reviewer_name":"Andy","comments":"It was very nice place to visit.

Although the instructions said that parking was tight, we were still able to parking a GMC Acadia (carefully) without any issues!!

We were so happy to return home here every night after long days of exploring the island. Could hear noise from the streets below until about 10pm but it quieted down significantly after that. We had a 2-door Jeep Wrangler and were able to fit it in the parking spot with no problems. The condo itself was good - very spacious, decent bed, nice decor. The air conditioning unit was extremely loud so we had to shut it off at night to sleep, although the evenings were so cool that we didn’t really need air conditioning anyways. Our biggest complaint was that the hosts did not provide enough toiletries to last us for our 8-night stay - we ran out of paper towels, Kleenex, shampoo and conditioner. Definitely would have been nice to be provided with more of these basic necessities. Overall a great choice if you’re looking for an exciting and conveniently-located place to stay."},{"_id":"284652022","date":{"$date":"2018-07-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18294310","reviewer_id":"37714550","reviewer_name":"Calvin","comments":"Super great location.

Due to all of the food options around we didn't do much cooking but if you would like to cook there are adequate kitchen supplies. This is a modest accommodation in a great location-which is in the heart of the action so it is a little busier. We were visiting from a small town so we enjoyed the all the people and enery! P.S.

The bed is a real bed. Shower is electric and low capacity so if you are 2, do not expect to take long showers or you will end up freezing. There is no heating so do except to freeze during the humid winters in Northern Portugal. The manager only gives you two small towel and very low quantity of toilet paper. The place it is really really small and very humid. It is OK for a couple of nights but not for more than that. Ok if you plan to eat outside all the time (if you can bear Portuguese heavy food for more than 2 days :) ). The kitchen is in fact a kitchenette and not equipped for cooking but only to warm up pre-made food.  There is no oil or salt, as in most Airbnb I have travelling to. Moreover, we went there in end of September and the house was really humid so, cooking, would have added more humidity to it. The bed is quite confortable and there is a good WIFI connection.  Shower is electric and low capacity so if you are 2, do not expect to take long showers or you will end up freezing. There is no heating so do except to freeze during the humid winter in Northern Portugal. There is no nice places around to have dinner but quite good bakeries to take breakfast in the morning (breakfast it is not included). Positive point: the place is spotless and Pedro was nice for the check-in.

Hors c’était une rue plus loin. Pas très grave, mais assez embêtant quand on se trimbale des valises.\nArrivé sur le lieu on nous explique que ce que nous avons loué n’est pas disponible, et qu’on nous propose ou de nous rendre l’argent de la nuit pour qu’on trouve autre chose, ou nous donner un autre logement. Sachant qu’il était déjà 21h, on a choisi l’autre logement de peur de ne rien trouver pour la nuit, du moins pas a nos tarifs. Et là surprise, l’autre logement était très loin du centre, dans un lieu moins sûr, à 15 min du métro, en devant traverser le « périphérique » de porto à pied, qui est un endroit très dangereux sachant qu’il n’y a pas de trottoir. \nJe connais la ville, j’ai pu me débrouiller avec mon conjoint par conséquent, mais pour quelqu’un qui ne connais pas, cela peu devenir très compliqué.\nLe lieu, c’était n’importe quoi. Tellement d’humidité que les draps, coussins, papier toilette était trempé. Surprise au moment du couché: nous n’avions pas un lit double, mais deux lits simples collé l’un à l’autre. La nuit fut douloureuse, dormir sur un bout de bois des structures de lit, c’est pas très agréable.\nRéveil compliqué également. Quelqu’un d’autre vivait dans l’appartement, hors nous avions demander un logement pour nous exclusivement. Mais ce n’est pas tout. Je n’osais pas sortir de ma chambre le matin venu, car j’entend différentes voix d’hommes dans le logement. Six hommes étaient entrain d’exécuter des travaux. Certains sont même passé devant la porte vitré de la chambre et ont regarder à l’intérieur, alors que j’étais coucher! \nNous y avons passé qu’une nuit. Le lendemain nous avons pu avoir le logement de départ, qui était prevu, et pour lequel nous avons payé.\nEt en effet là le logement était très sympa, et était conforme à ce qui avait été demander.\nSeuls petits soucis: un seul rouleau de papier toilette, peu d’ustensiles de cuisine, armoire cassé\nPoint positif: climatisation, réseau wifi fonctionnel, lieu assez chaleureux, et agréable pour un petit séjour en couple"}]}

Because it's a harbourside suburb, and this is Sydney,  the terrain is hilly and quite steep in parts and the views are breathtaking.    The suburb has wonderful urban, green, pretension-free, harbourside vibe.  It's a great place for hiking.  If golf's your thing, there's  a public golf course just up the road.  An absolute must see is the iconic Greenwich baths, one of the few remaining Sydney Harbour public swimming baths.    It you love to work your muscles, there are many parks with outdoor training facilities (the best is at the bottom of my garden),  tennis courts for hire, an aquatic centre in Lane Cove, all this with great transport links to the CBD for the business traveller.  What's not to like?  There's a reason that most who move to Greenwich tend to trade up and stay in the vicinity rather than moves to other parts of Sydney.","notes":"SECURITY - HOUSE ALARM AND VIDEO/AUDIO SURVEILLANCE Alarm: The interior of the property is fitted with a back to base monitored alarm system.  Instructions for the operation of this system are included in both the House Manual and the Arrival Directions. It is extremely simple.

With so much choice it gets confusing,  so I advise guests to download any of the many local public transport apps to use during their stay.

Tentei contato com a empresa, mas não mes responderam. Precisei entrar pela janela e forçar a chave com muita força para podermos sair. Quase perdemos a viagem de trem que havíamos comprado.\nSomente após eu entrar em contato em outro dia, a empresa me respondeu e consertou a porta.\n\n2 - Comprei 11 diárias, mas só havia um rolo de papel higiênico disponível. Solicitei mais e a empresa me atendeu.\n\n3 - Não havia como limpar o apartamento, pois não há vassoura ou pá.\n\n4 - O forno não funcionava direito.\n\n5 - A geladeira só funcionava se colocada no nível máximo. Toda vez que a deixei abaixo da temperatura mais fria, ela desligou e minha comida estragou. Quando coloco no máximo para que ela se mantenha ligada, os alimentos congelam e, por isso,  perdi minha salada.\n\n6 - O apartamento dispõe de dois quartos: um pequeno sem varanda e um grande com varanda.

El apartamento limpio y espacioso. Lo malo es que se escuchan todos los ruidos de las escaleras y de los otros pisos. Hay calefacción en dos habitaciones pero en la cocina y sobre todo en el baño hacía mucho frío. No tuvimos cosas básicas que normalmente encuentras en los pisos de Airbnb: sal, aceite, champú (había solo 4 pequeñitos para usar y tirar para 4 días y 4 personas) y etc. Es más como servicio de un hotel que un piso normal. La recepción muy buena, la chica super amable. Tuvimos unos problemas durante la estancia que el host intentó resolver. Así que bastante bueno pero no es nuestra mejor experiencia en Airbnb."},{"_id":"234614835","date":{"$date":"2018-02-13T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18330450","reviewer_id":"25028670","reviewer_name":"Trinidad","comments":"The apartment's in a great location, very clean and well equipped.

You are steps away from all the great restaurants and shops in Hell's Kitchen and blocks away from Times Square and a short walk to Central Park. The apartment is top notch with all the amenities listed and my family of 4 felt right at home relaxing after a long day checking out Manhattan. Joe's apartment is 100 times better than  booking a small hotel room in the area for basically the same price per night in the Times Square area plus Joe's apartment has much more room as well! Great location and great communication from Joe if you have any questions before or during your stay. We will definitely stay with Joe again the next time we are in NYC!"},{"_id":"299299654","date":{"$date":"2018-07-30T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18358621","reviewer_id":"169971342","reviewer_name":"Ann","comments":"We recently had a girls get-away to New York City.

I cannot imagine how our stay could have been any better.\r\n\r\nLaurence was an absolutely wonderful hostess. She left a few breakfast foods for us to enjoy on our first morning (bananas, a loaf of bread, yogurt, juice). Very thoughtful! She left guidebooks of Montreal for both of us and even printed a map of Verdun with personal suggestions of her favourite cafes, shops, and attractions. A local's input is invaluable. We did visit a few of her favourite spots and were very pleased. Thank you, Laurence! \r\n\r\nAs for the apartment itself, it was modern, bright, spacious, and very clean. The photos posted do in fact reflect the reality. I loved waking up to this calming space and coming home there after a day of sightseeing. It was truly a place where we could relax. \r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood was great, with many cafes and shops to explore on the main street (Wellington). For non-Quebec residents who are GoodLife members, you can use your membership to work out at Energie Cardio, which is a 10-min walk down the street. That was a nice bonus for me, since I was away from my regular gym for a whole week. The subway stop (A l'Eglise) was indeed just a minute's walk away.

Kara keeps her home spotlessly clean and her taste in decoration makes the space feel both luxurious and welcoming. I really can't emphasize enough how amazingly clean and tidy the home was - as dog owners ourselves, we have no idea how she manages to keep her place so totally free of dog fur. Comfy leather furniture, high end appliances, lovely artwork, and soft linens give Kara's home a very upscale feel.\n\nThe neighborhood is lively and full of history; we found the street noise to be quieter than most other parts of NYC, and Kara's neighbors are very friendly. There's a subway stop just around the corner on the 2/3 line. Be sure to follow Kara's recommendation for her favorite breakfast spot when you're on the way to or from the subway - we are certainly very glad we did!\n\nKara, thank you once more for your hospitality and thoughtfulness!

The area is extremely unsafe the crime rate is high and the neighbors will play music loud! Be extremely cautious as satistics of crime in the area speaks for themselves. The building is dilapidated, and, The host told me the dryer wasn’t working. Breakfast was listed as an amenity and that was an unfortunate mistake but the host did provide some oatmeal tea coffee after i insisted a few times. Overall the host tries to be a nice person. But be careful we had an argument because she didn’t want to lock doors after pple checked out and i had to go to work... so i asked the guests to slide the key under the door on their way out. Also i had to do the checkout for her if i wanted to feel safe. Honestly who doesn’t lock their doors in the bronx?! The wall of my room is a room divider and therefore doesn’t reach  ceiling height, this limits your privacy allot. The aircon is broken and blows no cold air and it makes allot of noise, emma offered me a fan instead. i guess thats it."},{"_id":"309041607","date":{"$date":"2018-08-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18375815","reviewer_id":"99803988","reviewer_name":"Frank","comments":"Very reasonable price for a comfortable space with nice thoughtful touches. \nThe space has everything you need.\nThe hosts were sweet and charming,  communicated swiftly and effectively, \nand went out of their way to ensure I was comfortable and satisfied\n\nGood location for access to city , CT and Westchester via bus or commuter train\n"},{"_id":"313049896","date":{"$date":"2018-08-24T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18375815","reviewer_id":"78988078","reviewer_name":"Ayala","comments":"Emma is warm and friendly.

It took us about 40 minutes to get to downtown with all the stops, but riding the subway was a pleasant experience especially because on the way there we rode past Yankee Stadium. \n\nTo be quite honest, we had a pleasant stay here with no problems! We got a set of keys that held a key for the front door, the door to get into the upstairs of the home, and to get into our room so we had no difficulty with feeling safe. The hosts were so so helpful and kind which made us feel great considering we are just a couple of young people exploring a big city. \n\nI recommend this place if you are looking for an affordable place to rest your head at night!!"},{"_id":"337835500","date":{"$date":"2018-10-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18377036","reviewer_id":"57780663","reviewer_name":"Adrien","comments":"Place is good value considering the price \u0026 location.\nLocation is in a lively and safe neighbourhood with many shops near the subway station.

Another luggage should be stored under the bed and other people must sit on the bed for us to open the luggage on the floor. LOL). The apartment located at tsim sha shui station exit c2 (blink your eyes and there you are, in front of your room) soooo close to the MTR station. Jane will give you a pdf doc once you arrived at HK. Don't forget to download it as the map is so clearly explained in it. Easy access to everywhere. Lively neighborhoods and easy to find foods (minimarts are everywhere).

Lots of malls are nearby as well and you need to be prepared (and loaded!) so you can actually buy stuff that you want.  I will definitely try again next time I will go to Hong Kong.

Die Kommunikation mit Brigitte war schon im Vorfeld sehr gut und intensiv - somit waren wir gut vorbereitet auf die Tage in Montreal und den Aufenthalt in Brigittes Appartement. Das Appartement selber war unglaublich schön eingerichtet, sauber und es fehlte an nichts - bis hin zu Kaffee, Tee, Obst, Gebäck und Croissants. Ein Tipp: Wir haben uns über (Website hidden by Airbnb) Fahrräder ausgeliehen und somit eine gute Alternative und Ergänzung zur Metro und den Bussen gefunden. Es gibt mehrere Fahrradstationen in direkter Nähe zu Brigittes Appartement. \nVielen Dank an Brigitte - eine tolle Wohnung: 10 von 10 Sterne! :-)"},{"_id":"195738096","date":{"$date":"2017-09-20T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18421662","reviewer_id":"112896022","reviewer_name":"Patricia","comments":"Logement très agréable, très propre, lumineux, décoration sobre et agréable.

Let me start off by saying that considering what you get this is good value for the money and one of the cheaper and relatively central located houses (other locations at the same price offer a room or shared place). The house features all the basics and has a nice back garden with a small area where you can sit. Walking to the city center is a bit too far, but you can easily go by car. Parking is not too expensive and is usually around or below €1 per hour. However, of you look around you may be able to find some parking spaces where parking is free (we did). I'm not sure how easy it is to get to the city center by public transport, but it can't be too hard. I noticed some buses going off and on, so this should be fine. Do note however, that we have been informed that later in the day buses may not drove past the area/house. All in all a fine place to stay for a reasonable price. Some details that may be of interest to you: 1) Sandra speaks English so if you are received by her you should be fine, 2) the furniture and interior is dated so don't expect any super fancy interior (buy you can tell by the pictures), 3) out back there is a garden with a nice terrace where you can sit, 4) the beds are somewhat small / short and a bit hard so not super comfortable, finally 5) the power access points are at somewhat inconvenient places and there aren't too many of them free. So when staying at this house for more than a few days I would recommend to bring or ask Sandra for a power box. If you wish to sit in the garden for a long time using your laptop I would recommend a power box with a long cable. I think these are some minor points, but may be of significance to some. Thanks for staying at your place Sandra!"},{"_id":"174000116","date":{"$date":"2017-07-24T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18437734","reviewer_id":"130292751","reviewer_name":"Benoit","comments":"Logement propre et agréable proche de Porto et en accord avec la description.

La casa è molto carina, arredata con gusto, solo il bagno è un po' datato e ci vuole un po' di pazienza con il boiler perché l'acqua calda finisce rapidamente, il giardino è bellissimo e ampio, la zona è decentrata e molto tranquilla, se si cerca relax è il posto ideale. La fermata del bus verso Porto si trova a circa 7 minuti di cammino (parzialmente in salita), devo dire che per noi con 3 bambini non è stato semplicissimo, inoltre purtroppo (Hidden by Airbnb) Maps non fornisce indicazioni per raggiungere la zona con i mezzi pubblici quindi per muoversi sono indispensabili le indicazioni di Sandra. E anche in questo caso lei è stata gentilissima e super disponibile, le siamo molto grati per questo. La casa non è caldissima, nei giorni del nostro soggiorno la temperatura era abbastanza bassa, ma Sandra è stata rapidissima nel procurarci una stufetta elettrica appena l'abbiamo chiesta. Nel complesso è una sistemazione che sicuramente consigliamo.

My husband \u0026 I met the few full time residents and the other guests within days at a group BBQ and it just became one big family after that. Our privacy was never an issue but neither was joining in on whatever was going on. The property itself is peaceful as only pastures with rescue horses, goats, a kitty \u0026 two dogs can offer. Mother Nature has blessed the top tip (North) of the Big Island, with lush foliage of all sorts as it rains (mostly) by night. If you wake to rain and wanted a sun day just pack a bag for the beach and within 25 mins there's glorious blue skies. We stayed just over a month \u0026 those with dietary concerns may have a bit of an issue with cooking as there's just a hotplate but if you enjoy fresh fruits \u0026 avocados (right on property) salads, etc there's a fridge that you can fill from the market in Hawi (2 miles up the road) or the plentiful grocery store. Eats in the Kapaau hood are amazing - Chaba's (authentic \u0026 awesome) Thai restaurant (within walking distance) was one of our faves as was the little fish place right beside it that just opened during our stay. Great to order To Go \u0026 drive up the hill home and eat on your own deck. In Hawi (2 miles up the road) check out Sweet Potato Kitchen for Vegan offerings all 3 places Organic (something one needs to ask - not assume). On days you want to laze around and just feed the horses - work on your novel or poetry - but find yourself hankering for a swim as the day grows warmer - the ommunity center pool is also walk-able (about 1/2 mile) that also boasts a gym and tennis courts - all free. Bobi has an incredible life story that includes how her add on house became home to a dozen children - I'll let her tell it over a huge prawn dinner \u0026 tequila : ) but suffice to say it's no wonder the atmosphere of kindness permeates your stay. We were fortunate to live in the Garden Room as well as the Patio Room and both are lovely. The later worked better for us because of our longer stay with it's two floor spaciousness and big fridge. If you're going to stay a while and aren't out and about as much (like us : ) we highly recommend the extra $ for the space. Aloha to all of you who made our vacation one to truly cherish \u0026 special warm wishes to Pam for getting me hooked on snorkeling - Sarah for all her love and knowledge of herbal remedies (I miss you both) and of course dear Bobi - who is the matriarch of this peaceful yet active hub and who shared her wealth of knowledge and..."},{"_id":"71183992","date":{"$date":"2016-04-24T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1844208","reviewer_id":"68260518","reviewer_name":"Nancy","comments":"I stayed in Bobi's Garden View room or two nights.

Hawi town is a little further - about five miles - and has more shops, galleries, restaurants and a grocery store.  We upgraded to the \"Sundeck Suite\" which was beautiful and would be perfect for a family.  The large deck was great, with goats down below, the ocean in the distance, and, on a clear day, the mountains of Maui.  The house is surrounded by gardens and the Sundeck Suite is surrounded by windows - perfect!  Bobi provides everything you need in terms of dishes, pots and utensils.  There are even beach towels and a cooler if you want to go to the beach.  I have to say, I was surprised to find our time was up (we only stayed 3 nights) - I could have stayed longer.

The house is very clean and updated (new W/D, TV, breakfast bar, A/C in rooms) with excellent views from anywhere in the house. The house has everything you would need, from extra pillows, blankets, dishware, coffee maker, etc.  The pool is also very nice with deck chairs, table, and a variety of float toys provided.  With the combination of the great views and pool, one couldn't be blamed if they spent their time in Honolulu relaxing at the house!

Centrally located in east O‘ahu neighborhood of Aina Haina, Hannah’s place is located on the ridge overlooking the beautiful Maunalua Bay.  Take advantage of cup of Kona coffee on the lanai and watch the sunrise, it is a truly magical experience ! My family and I spent two weeks here.  House was spacious and tastefully decorated. Hannah had everything we needed to cook up an scrumptious Thanksgiving feast.  Neighborhood is very safe as well. We took a nice walk after dinner to work off the food and enjoy the cool trade winds and fantastic views of the ocean. We also used the pool/patio area quite a bit to take refreshing dips after days at the beach and for happy hour/dinners.  Grocery stores are just minutes away either in Aina Haina or Kahala. Lots of options for restaurants also.  Couple of highlights - Hunakai Beach, a hidden gem of a beach, off the beaten path in the Kahala neighborhood. The Veranda at the Kahala Resort - great place for wine and appetizers. They have a fantastic jazz pianist most evenings. I loved the aloha vibe at the place !  All in all, I’m so happy that I found Hannah’s place. We will definitely stay here again !"},{"_id":"216444287","date":{"$date":"2017-12-03T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18465195","reviewer_id":"9339086","reviewer_name":"Marisallie","comments":"We had a great time at our staycation!

Our host, Hannah, gave us the gate and door code ahead of time, however, she still took the time to meet us there in person to go through everything. “House of Hawaii Dreams” offers great ocean and sunrise views from the small balcony, living area, and king bedroom and the kitchen offers great ocean views as well as lush green mountain views. The king BR does not have direct access to the bathroom but the queen bedroom does adjoin to the one bathroom and you can also access the bath from the living area. Plenty of closet and drawers for storage. There was enough floor space in the queen BR for our younger son to sleep on the air mattress provided (not super-comfortable but it worked OK for our 4 night stay - there is also a sleeper sofa in the living area but he chose the air mattress to be in the BR.) There were plenty of beach and bath towels and beach chairs, umbrellas (and toys for young children) available for guest use in the garage and we appreciated the gas grill. The location is good for accessing most areas of the island and Waikiki was about a 20 minute drive with traffic. Highly recommend beautiful Kailua Beach Park (about 35-40 minutes) A Foodland grocery store and good pizza at Pieology are located about 5 minutes away in a shopping center down the hill and to the left on the main highway. We had rain one day and it was nice to find a movie theater in a shopping mall just a few miles away.  Communication with Hannah was great from start to finish.\n\nOne thing to note: I didn’t realize when I booked in early June that there is another rental home on the same property and the pool, garage/supplies, and driveway are shared between the two units. This 2 BR unit is situated above the 3-car garage and the main home sits below and to the left side of the apartment. Other than the pool area, the balconies and outdoor spaces at both units are very private. The main home was occupied by other renters during the entirety of our stay by two different families, however, they were out most every day and quiet at night (as was our family.) The pool was too cold to use during our stay so we never had any shared time at the pool or any issues whatsoever but just wanted to mention to set expectations for future rentals. \n\nWe had a nice stay and we hope to return some day and stay longer on Oahu next time.

The only minor negative was that it is not downtown, but is about a seven minute walk to an easy to navigate metro. However, it is very close to the biodome and Olympic stadium, and driving (another pro: not having to pay to park downtown, as street parking is easy at their place) is only about six minutes. What really pushed the experience over the top was the great communication skills of the host: they were super responsive before and during our stay, and it was made clear they were there if we needed anything while still respecting everyone's privacy. They were also very accommodating that one of our guests was arriving early, and even let us know when the room was ready! A great level of kindness, and a great host.

Once we were settled though, my husband and I loved the apartment! We were able to cook there and it was a good size for 2 people. There is a big park right across the street that was nice to walk in and if you want to, you could walk to downtown and save the hassle of driving. Rafael was also a great host and was very quick about responding to questions we had! He also left some snacks out for us and made staying there easy.

The ceiling is high and the main room has huge windows, which is beautiful. If you're travelling when it is 15C outside, consider that the apartment is not very well heated and you should have warm clothes at home. You can basically hear every movement in the hallway / staircase. When we were there (March 2018), there was a construction work in the street starting quite early. \nWe had a big problem with the shower drain as the water was not running down (apparently it did but very slowly), nevertheless Dulce tried her best to solve the issue - thanks for that!"},{"_id":"245997936","date":{"$date":"2018-03-24T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18574397","reviewer_id":"165437948","reviewer_name":"Marvin","comments":"Alles top gerne wieder!

Ideally located in the heart of Williamsburg, a few hundred meters away from Marcy Av. station, with a beautiful view on Williamsburg bridge (especially from the roof top, a bike station just at your doorstep, their place can comfortably accommodate a family of 5. Convenience stores are less than a block away. Make sure you reserve time enough to walk the streets around and the Metro line up to Bushwick, whose atmosphere is worth discovering. We didn't meet with Ana y Victor but every thing was ready for our (late) arrival, access was easy and we didn't encounter any issue during our stay. Thanks again for this great stay!

For being a NYC apartment, it is quite sizable with plenty of room for our group of 5 (2 couples and a singleton). The views from the balcony are great and even though the train goes by right outside, the apartment was surprisingly quiet. Victor was a great host - easy to contact and very helpful. The only thing to note is that it is a 4th floor walk-up, so if you have issues with stairs, it may be a little difficult to access (this wasn't an issue for us).

Check in and out was seamless. The beds were comfortable. The location is close to the best of what Williamsburg has to offer and to the train to Manhattan. A citi bike dock is right outside the door. The area directly outside the unit is a bit seedy but we always felt safe and as I said it is a short walk to the hip parts of Williamsburg. The view from the two bedrooms is spectacular as you can see the Manhattan skyline and the hustle bustle of the city on the street below. We thought the trains going by were a big plus. If you need a place to stay that is clean, comfy and conveniently located Victor and Ana’s  place is a good choice. Finally Victor was easy to communicate with and a great host."},{"_id":"268034549","date":{"$date":"2018-05-23T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18586018","reviewer_id":"109106464","reviewer_name":"Shirish","comments":"Nice place to stay in and Victor made the say feel like home."},{"_id":"269037173","date":{"$date":"2018-05-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18586018","reviewer_id":"83924782","reviewer_name":"Rijul","comments":"Great location, beautiful terrace and views from the balcony- super efficient hosts and smooth communication!
