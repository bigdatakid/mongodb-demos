Puso detalles como bebidas de cortesía en la heladera del cuarto. Tanto este como el baño , la ropa de cama y del cuarto de baño, estaban impecables. En resumen fue una experiencia más que agradable. De esos lugares a los que quisiera volver siempre. Me he sentido cuidada, protegida y valorada.

Recomiendo este departamento y Great Vacation Retreat. El personal me respondió inmediatamente a todas mis dudas. Recogimos el auto en Enterprise sin problemas, y luego las llaves. El departamento es muy acogedor y está muy bien ubicado. La playa del resort es preciosa, y si bien hay muchas playas hermosas en Kauai, nosotros pasamos casi todos los días disfrutando de ésta. También un día aprovechamos el servicio de la piscina, que se encuentra enfrente e incluso se puede acceder caminando. Hay varios supermercados cerca. Algunos (los más económicos)  se llega en 5 minutos de auto.\r\nEl departamento tiene de TODO: toallas, shampoo, jabón, secador de pelo, detergente para platos y para la ropa... No se necesita llevar nada. ¡Tiene hasta los snorkel para disfrutar en la playa! \r\n¡Hemos pasado unas vacaciones estupendas! ¡Muchas gracias! Thank you so much!\r\n\r\nECCELLENTE !! Vi consiglio questo appartamento e Great Vacation Retreat. Il personale ha risposto immediatamente tutte le mie domande. Abbiamo preso la macchina ad Enterprise senza problemi, e poi le chiavi. L'appartamento è molto accogliente ed è  ben posizionato. La spiaggia del villaggio è bellissima, e sebbene ci sono molte belle spiagge a Kauai, abbiamo trascorso quasi tutti giorni in questa spiaggia. Anche un giorno siamo andati in piscina la cui si trova di fronte e ci si può arrivare a piedi. Ci sono diversi supermercati nei dintorni. Alcuni (i più economici) si possono raggiungere in 5 minuti di macchina.\r\nL'appartamento ha di TUTTO: asciugamani, shampoo, sapone, phon, sapone per i piatti e vestiti ... Non c'è bisogno di portare nulla. Ed anche lo snorkel per godersi la spiaggia!\r\n\r\nAbbiamo trascorso una vacanza splendida! Grazie!

Magnificent sunsets every night! The units are well equipped and ok for a family of five (although it may feel somewhat crowded after a while). We can fully recommend unit 307 which was nice and quiet. However, we also spent a few days in unit 335 which faces the main road/intersection. Traffic noise can be very annoying late at night (party people) and early in the morning (construction trucks). We did not make use of the \"free\" rental car as the upgrade to full size plus insurance would have been more expensive than the package we booked online."},{"_id":"107930659","date":{"$date":"2016-10-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11993586","reviewer_id":"84249731","reviewer_name":"Deborah","comments":"O apartamento é uma graça!

Apartamento pequeno, mas com tudo o que a gente precisou. A localização do condomínio é ótima! Perto de mercado, restaurante, próximo da praia e um shopping do outro lado da rua. O clube de Poipu fica super perto, dando pra ir a pé! O concierge do condomínio é super educado e acessível e nos ajudou em tudo o que precisávamos! Escolha excelente!

The plantation style of Kiahuna resort (lots of wood \u0026 shutters) is so much nicer in my opinion than the surrounding Sheraton \u0026 Hyatt hotels. But the Sheraton has a nice buffet breakfast and there is a shopping village just across the road - everything you want in Poipu is an easy walk. Only drawback for us (1 couple \u0026 2 adult children) was having to partially pack up the two sofa beds to fully use the living space but this worked better than expected.

It's very close to the ocean - just a nice walk through a garden to get there. The apartment kitchen was well-equipped to make our own dinners and other meals, and we enjoyed them on the lanai together. We loved the beach, and the huge, green, grassy area in the central part of Kiuhuna Plantation, where families BBQed, kicked the soccer ball around, and lounged while looking at the ocean. The management - Great Vacation Retreats - was super nice, and provided free rental car, free parking, and free beach towels. We also enjoyed a day at the nearby athletic club, which is also provided free, playing in the fun pool. The area where the apartment is located - Poipu - feels like the center of a fun and active scene on Kauai. I highly recommend this place."},{"_id":"145313316","date":{"$date":"2017-04-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11993586","reviewer_id":"25175127","reviewer_name":"Tiffany","comments":"This condo is amazing.

The condo itself is beautifully decorated and has soaps that smell amazing. We came to this condo as a part of our honeymoon trip and they even included some champagne and Hawaiian sweets. We had a small issue with finding our key in the provided lock box, but when we contacted them, we had a manager come to the place within 5 minutes to solve the issue. We were very impressed.

The condo is walking distance to the beach, restaurants, stores, and a club. Entry to the Athletic Club is a definite plus with a swimming pool with a slide, ping pong table, gym, tennis courts. They also held our luggage after we checked out. The unit is well equipped and the grills outside are great. It's also very private and quiet. Our host was amazing. Everything from making the reservation to checking out was easy and stress-free. She provided us with very helpful information about the area. I had mentioned that we were there for my mom's birthday and she left us a bottle of wine and balloons. The only reason I did not give this listing five stars is because the unit is a bit small for the number of guests allowed.

Super convenient location, peaceful setting, great amenities and wonderful suggestions in the guest book. Bar Acuda for dinner in Hanalei is indeed not to be missed! This could fit 4 people though it would be a bit tight.... we would have been willing for our kind of trip (out and about all day). The hosts were super communicative and the Airbnb comes with free car rental! A true bargain. One note - no aircon only fans but there were plenty of them. If you are the type to hang inside midday you may find it a bit too hot but at night it was totally fine.

Since this was our first trip to Kauai we didn’t know what to expect and only knew that we wanted to be at or near Poipu Beach because we’d heard it was beautiful and we had friends who had booked into the Sheraton. The location was perfect within easy walking to the beach and a five minute walk to the Sheraton. The rental car, included in our booking, was ideal as it allowed us to explore the entire island during our stay, and to head to dryer land when it threatened to rain.\n\nThe unit itself was clean, well equipped and very comfortable. We were easily able to cook anything we wanted with the fully stocked kitchen. The views of the garden easily made up for the lack of an ocean view. There are communal gas grills scattered about the property which were so clean we assumed they were rarely used, but we were wrong on that score as we had some fun conversations with our neighbors around the grills as we all prepared our dinners. \n\nAll in all, this place was perfectly situated and our hosts made the experience truly care-free."},{"_id":"252245196","date":{"$date":"2018-04-09T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11993586","reviewer_id":"167294451","reviewer_name":"Rob","comments":"Amazing value, and the included car rental made a big difference.

It took some adjusting for us to hang out in the area.  The area is considered 'gritty' which is extremely true. I cant stress that enough. It is dirty, you might be bothered for spare change, you might be asked to swipe your metro card for someone,  however the area does have some of the coolest restaurants in the city. But you must go looking for them, otherwise you will only find corner deli's that don't take international credit cards and random pawn shops etc.  We actually loved our experience at Shannon's though. Shannon's studio was great. Lots of space for two. The only complaints we had were that the walls were paper thin and it was all around a bit dirty. We washed the dishes before using them since they were dusty and just kept a fan at night to block out noise. We also could not reach Shannon until the day of our reservation and had to wait past check in time to get the keys. Once we were in contact, Shannon was super nice and helpful. The roof top is amazing! You can see some of Manhatten's skyline. The subway takes about half an hour to get to Manhatten , once you are there, probably another 15 to wherever you want to go. It is nice to get away from the zoo of Manhatten, I strongly recommend staying in Brooklyn, it's gives you more of a well rounded experience.  For us, this was great, we loved the experience of what it would be like to live there."},{"_id":"57201403","date":{"$date":"2015-12-23T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1200438","reviewer_id":"13613061","reviewer_name":"Jessica","comments":"Shannon's apartment was fantastic.

The apartment has a big bed as well as a lofted bed so it offers lots of sleeping space. The living room is huge and it's attachment to the kitchen make the entire space very livable and great to have people over. The bathroom is comfortable, has enough storage, and well functioning. The kitchen is well equipped and Shannon left a wide supply of food which was super nice and convenient. \n\nBesides it's convenience the apartment has a very unique kinda vintage artsy style which adds a special touch to staying in New York. Only caveat here is that it may feel a bit old and unkept, especially the kitchen floor which needs a little fixing. But if you're cool with a little vintage style, then you'll love the place. \n\nIn terms of the neighborhood, Bushwick is definitely up and coming, so it's really cool to discover some of the cool restaurants and coffee shops around. It's also great to be so close to the subway and the trip to manhattan is smooth and short. However, do note that this is still a gritty area, especially around the subway station so it may feel a bit edgy for some folks. Also, while getting to lower manhattan is very easy, the trek to other areas uptown may take up to 50min or so. But overall it's a great place to stay to get good value for your buck.\n\nBeyond the place and area itself, Shannon and Nez were PHENOMENAL hosts, readily available via text, easy check in and check out and they even helped me out with some mail I needed to get, so thanks so much to both of them. \n\nOverall, awesome experience with a great place with tons of space and style, a cool neighborhood and great hosts.

Zum einen kamen wir nicht rein in die Wohnung, weil wir erst als wir vor der Tür standen, erfahren mussten dass das Keybox defekt ist und wir warten müssen, dass jemand zufällig das Gebäude verlässt, damit wir in das Gebäude reinkommen. Und dass um 10 Uhr abends und dieser Gegend mit einem kleinen Kind! Viel schlimmer war jedoch die Tatsache, dass die defekten Gasleitungen in der Wohnung frei lagen und man keine 30 Minuten drin bleiben konnte ohne eine Vergiftung zu riskieren. Möchte nicht wissen, wie hoch die Gefahr einer Explosion war, hätten wir das Gasherd angezündet (Bilder vorhanden, falls dies jemand wünscht). Da wir in dieser Gegend nicht nachts raus wollten, haben wir die ganze Nacht bei 5 Grad Celsius die Fenster offen gehabt und kein Auge zugemacht. Am nächsten morgen wollten wir die Buchung stornieren und das Appartement verlassen, was wir auch getan haben. Und die Höhe war, das Shannon mir versprach die Bezahlten Beträge zu retournieren, aber am Ende sowohl die Cleaning fees (die Wohnung haben wir unsauber angetroffen, Bilder kann ich gerne zur Verfügung stellen) als auch für die erste Nacht zahlen mussten. Lächerlicher Service, sowohl von Shannon als auch von AirBnB. Guter Grund eigentlich, nicht mehr darüber zu buchen."},{"_id":"251715281","date":{"$date":"2018-04-08T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1200438","reviewer_id":"4114654","reviewer_name":"Joe","comments":"Great space in the heart of Bushwick with a fun community room in the basement!"},{"_id":"254383505","date":{"$date":"2018-04-16T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1200438","reviewer_id":"179144906","reviewer_name":"Joost","comments":"A very nice almost hidden place in a very nice and cool neighbourhood!"},{"_id":"257526485","date":{"$date":"2018-04-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1200438","reviewer_id":"16556706","reviewer_name":"Michael","comments":"Un bon quartier, un bel immeuble, de la vie partout autour.\nSéjour agréable, on peut faire les courses facilement ou manger dans les petits\nrestaurants.\nAppartement confortable pour qui aime l'esprit \"vintage\".\nLe métro à 2 minutes.\nShannon peut être un peu longue à répondre par mail, mais rapide au téléphone.\nJe retournerais avec plaisir chez Shannon."},{"_id":"264341635","date":{"$date":"2018-05-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1200438","reviewer_id":"30213121","reviewer_name":"Jade","comments":"Shannon’s apartment is very well located, 2mn from the main subway lines going directly to Chinatown, the financial district... \nEven though it’s in an old building, the apartment is very clean and comfortable for 2 to 4 people. \nShannon let us bottles of water and fruits which was very nice of her and has been very reactive to our questions."},{"_id":"285358059","date":{"$date":"2018-07-03T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1200438","reviewer_id":"2586500","reviewer_name":"Alex","comments":"L'appartement de Shannon est idéalement situé à Bushwick.

There are two nearby subways that make it easy to get around Brooklyn and into Manhattan. The space was clean and nicely appointed, and it was a real plus to have laundry and a gym in the basement. We did stay in January during the polar vortex days and so often it did get very cold - but at night we were fine in the bed at the top of the ladder.

The only issue is that we decided to take the metro which is about a 12 to 20 minute walk depending on your stride and stamina.

Des boutiques vintage ou design, sont à côté d’autres endroits qui vendent des produits électriques pour artisans comme nous n’en voyons plus à Paris. Nous avons été si bien accueillis par Alexandra qui s’occupe de la maison. Elle parle un français parfait et l’anglais aussi. Elle nous a donné plein de bonnes informations pour profiter de Porto. La maison, elle-même est magnifique. Elle vient juste d’être rénovée. Nous avons adoré la pierre que la propriétaire a sauvegardée sous les fenêtres et autour des portes et les volets typiques à l’intérieur. La décoration est très soignée. Là aussi, un mix d’objets très design, comme la superbe lampe dans la cuisine ou dans le salon et des petits meubles vintage un peu partout, très beaux. La cuisine est un bonheur. On pouvait prendre notre petit déjeuner sur la terrasse qui donne sur un petit jardin adorable où l’on peut descendre par un large escalier. Nous avions un grand choix de vaisselle magnifique. Les chambres sont aussi très confortables. Chacune avait sa salle de bains. Mais le must, c’est les draps. Nous avons eu l’impression de dormir dans un hôtel 5 étoiles. Douillets et soyeux à souhait.

Still very much worth the visit.  The Kahuku Units remains open.\r\n\r\nAfter three months of eruptions in lower Puna punctuated by a damaging wildfire that burned nearly 3,800 acres of forest on Mauna Loa and Hurricane Lane lashing the Island with heavy rains and strong winds at the end of August the Island of Hawaii is in recovery mode and regaining normalcy.  AND we have a new Black Sand Beach at Pohoiki which IS accessible.\r\n\r\nThe USGS and Hawaiian Volcano Observatory are reporting that sulfur dioxide emissions at Kilauea summit and in the Lower East Rift Zone in Puna, where lava flows were occurring, have fallen drastically since the start of August and are at their lowest combined level in more than a decade.\r\n\r\nKilauea's latest eruption began May 3 with lava flowing continuously until Aug. 6. The affected Puna area, in the southeast corner of the island comprises one percent of the island of Hawaii, which is larger than all of the other Hawaiian Islands combined.  We are in Upper Puna and were not affected by the flow.\r\nVisit Hawaii Volcanoes National Park   OR  USGS Kilauea for future updates.\r\n\r\nKAEO is an enthusiastic gardener,occasional travel agent, sometimes Hula Girl, Hawaii born, ambassador to the culture, caregiver, former Ad exec and sometimes 'pretty good cook'.  She has lived on Oahu, Maui and now the \"best\"-Island of Hawaii.  I've hiked hundreds on miles on ALL the islands, in past days:  Mauna Loa, Waimanu, Polipoli, Waihee, Wailau, Hauula, the Koolaus \u0026 Wainae Mountains.  A kayak trip to Kalalau circumvented the difficult 10.8m hike.  KARL is a master tile setter and works on all phases of the Carpentry, Remodel \u0026 Building Industry.  He built Eco Hale; we estimate using at least 60% re-purposed materials.  He also built our home in Mountain View and worked with his family numerous times on the Mainland and Hawaii to build their homes.  He is a Huge sports fan (Raiders in particular).  Karl comes from a family that simply needs their toothbrush when someone announces \"Road Trip\"; hence thousands of miles visiting U.S. parks, cities and sights.  Our romance began on the island of Maui and our adventure, commitment and curiosity to/for one another continues.\r\nWe love the entrepreneurial, independent alternative lifestyle and very much enjoy sharing our slice of paradise in the rain forest.

Actually, we both agreed that it was the best accommodation we have stayed in on all of the Hawaiian islands so far (hadn't changed yet either). Kaeo \u0026 Karl were so nice \u0026 welcoming and made our stay even nicer and more memorable by giving us great tips on local activities \u0026 beaches, and sharing their garden-grown fruits with us. The hale was clean \u0026 comfortable with many nice touches \u0026 attention to detail. The \"outdoor shower\", which I was initially afraid of would mean showering on the lawn being bitten in the butt by mosquitoes, turned out to be a clean and beautiful separate room with a large window for good views into the rainforesty garden. You definitely need a car to get there, it's a little out of the way, but we enjoyed that most and the privacy the hale and our hosts allowed us. Waking up and feeling as if you're alone in a rainforest is pretty cool \u0026 special. Thank you Kaeo \u0026 Karl for the lovely time! We'd come back in a heartbeat.\r\n\r\nWir haben unseren Aufenthalt in Kaeo \u0026 Karl's Gästehaus total genossen. Wir sind uns sogar einig, dass es unser schönstes airbnb Erlebnis von allen auf Hawaii (nicht nur der big island) war - und das hat sich auch bisher nicht geändert.\r\nKaeo \u0026 Karl sind super nett, haben uns herzlich empfangen und unseren Aufenthalt noch schöner gemacht indem sie uns tolle Tipps für Aktivitäten und Strände gegeben und die leckeren Früchte aus ihrem Garten mit uns geteilt haben. \r\nDas Gästehaus selbst war super sauber und hatte alles, was man so braucht, mit vielen schönen Details. Die Außendusche, von der ich erst annahm sie würde bedeuten 'duschen auf dem Rasen mit lauter Mücken' ist ein sehr schöner Raum mit Toilette, Waschbecken, Duschkabine und großem Fenster mit Blick in den Regenwald-Garten. Toll! Ihr braucht definitiv ein Auto, ohne kommt man nicht hin, aber die Privatsphäre, die uns unsere Gastgeber gegeben haben und das Gefühl morgens alleine im Regenwald aufzuwachen (sehr schön!) war genau das, was wir uns gewünscht hatten. Wir würden sofort wieder hin fahren!

I loved the sound of the frogs and birds and even thunderstorms for bedtime music. I picked fresh tangerines for the best-ever breakfast juice right from the lanai, and when I asked Kaeo about how to enjoy the fresh coconut, she got out her tools and helped me crack into it - there's nothing finer than fresh coconut water for an evening cocktail in the rainforest.\r\n\r\nThis isn't a beach resort, but in fact, I liked it better.

The attention to detail in the design of the space and all the equipment provided is remarkable. Seriously, I had absolutely everything I needed -- including things above and beyond like coffee, papaya, avocado, filtered water and chocolate. And there seems to be an invisible orchid fairy wandering around in the jungle who delivers fragrant and fresh-picked flowers every time you turn around for more than a second. \n\nEco Hale is at a perfect location if you want to explore. Very easy access Volcano National Park. (I even hiked to see the lava from a point nearby -- amazing!). I also visited the hot ponds, the Portlandia-like little town of Pahoa, took yoga classes in Hilo, jaunted down to Kalani retreat center, saw the glowing crater late at night under a starlit sky, the Black Sand Beach, the Green Sand Beach and more... \n\nI thought about asking Kaeo and Karl if they would adopt me forever and ever, but all good things must come to an end. Don't worry about the rain, or the fact that you cannot walk to a white sand beach, or the lack of bars serving up Mai Thai in the immediate vicinity. None of these things are an obstacle. Come see what this luxurious little jungle cabin has in store for you.\n\n\n"},{"_id":"12915707","date":{"$date":"2014-05-14T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1206363","reviewer_id":"11614453","reviewer_name":"Cathy","comments":"This place is such a gem.

If you are looking for somewhere off the beaten path, this is the place for you. At night, it seems as if you are staying in the middle of a jungle rainforest (though with surprisingly few pests; in fact, I didn't even notice mosquitoes at night). The cottage was clean and smartly outfitted; the owners included everything you might want for your Big Island adventures (snorkel equipment, beach chairs and towels, ponchos and umbrellas, etc.); Kaeo and Karl were even nice enough to leave us fresh fruit, banana bread, and other treats. I would definitely recommend Eco Hale for travelers eager to escape the resort scene and glimpse a bit of life in inland Hawaii. That said, it's barely a 25 minute drive (if that) to the Volcano Park or Hilo, so you are never that far from major tourist destinations.

Secluded without feeling disconnected, privacy without inattention, eco-friendly with all the comforts of nice accommodations -- plus a lot of sweet (literally!) little extras here and there, ample complementary snacks and staple foods to tie-over in a pinch, not to mention delicious samplings of fresh local fruits \u0026 snacks to really make \"downtime\" in this wonderful garden-place a treat to savor, rain or shine. My travel buddy arrived several hours after me, entailing a long drive across the island at night to collect him; when Kaeo realized this, she immediately offered to prepare a plate of food for us so we could come straight back and relax. She was making what would prove a lovely roast chicken with ample sides. She asked about my friend's diet and I mentioned that he is pesco, but surely we'd do fine munching on whatever she was making. However, Kaeo insisted on cooking up a nice little Ahi steak, just for him! The welcome wagon from both Kaeo \u0026 Karl was warm indeed, beginning with enthusiastic and detailed arrival guidance a week before our stay, and they tended to our few needs while there seamlessly and with complete discretion -- we never saw either of them again during our stay until Kaeo dropped by the morning of our departure to send us on our way with a warm goodbye. Binders chock full of local interest and maps gave us everything we needed to make the most of our brief visit, and their lush and beautiful property was a constant feast for the senses, both inside and out. A very different kind of stay experience, with a quality that can't be judged in relation the usual lodging options, but a fully and beautifully conceived package all its own. While deeply immersed in the local situation -- running water is pumped from a catchment, power is solar and to be used moderately, and the free wifi provided is a mobile hotspot with a limited data plan -- everything is nicely done (all the lights work, hot water is great, purified drinking water is provided, and the internet is there whenever you need it) -- we wanted for nothing. This is no cabin in the woods but a thoroughly pleasant, modern, modest yet comfortable, fully-appointed abode with everything you need (food and cooking stuff, nice personal care \u0026 bathroom products, fun things you might need for day trips, etc), steeped in the slightly wild Puna and the sense of sharing in the good life that Kaeo \u0026 Karl have lovingly built and nurtured here. The booking and transaction couldn't have been smoother; all we had to do was leave HI sales tax in the envelope provided when we left.

The bathroom is right next door, also private, with hot water and also is so nice. The decorations in the room and bathroom are really great and you can tell Kaeo and Karl have put a lot of time into making the Eco Hale feel like a home, and it does. \r\n\r\nKaeo and Karl have provided all the necessary kitchen items for it to be a home, plates, cups, pots, pans, french press, fresh fruit, condiments, lots of snacks, everything you could need and more.

I really enjoyed talking with Kaeo, she and Karl have really created a wonderful life on the Big Island  off the grid and super comfortable. \r\n\r\nKaeo also has great knowledge of the area and great recommendations for hiking, snorkeling, etc. There are snorkels, boogie boards, cooler, beach chairs, books about hiking, birds, towels, anything you could think of really, available for use by guests. They have also prepared a huge binder of information about the area that I found extremely useful. \r\n\r\nThe location is great, in between Kea'au and Volcano and it was a quick trip to beach/snorkeling and excellent hiking in Volcanos National Park. Their home is in a beautiful fern forest and there are lots of birds during the day and singing coqui frogs at night. Sleeping to the sounds of frogs is the best. Kaeo is easily reached by phone, text, or going to her house if you need.\r\n\r\nI can't recommend Eco Hale enough.

The lodge is isolated from the road, surrounded by exotic (to us) plants and animals and although it is a small drive from Hilo - trust us, it is worth it! The bathroom facilities were even better than some other bnb places we stayed in. Although, because it's an eco lodge, the water needs to be pumped every so often and if you go to the toilet in the middle of the night - it will wake the neighbours! Overall we rate it 9/10.

We were so happy to see some green sea turtles on our last day at the black sand beach, thanks to Kaeo! \r\n\r\nWe strongly recommend Eco Hale to anyone who is about to visit the big island. You will LOVE the unique experience! Great location especially for volcano hikers! Would definitely come back when we visit the big island again!

She knows that her Eco Hale is an unusual place that attracts people who want a different experience of the Big Island.\r\n\r\nThis is our second trip to the island, and we opted for airbnb hosts instead of the resort experience, precisely because we wanted contact with real people and their lives. We got this here - just the right amount. Kaeo and Karl were present but never invasive; always helpful and sweet. Kaeo also cooked an amazing meal for us - seared ahi on salad, perhaps the best dinner we have had on the island. We started off a 2-week trip by decompressing off-grid here. We’d say this was just the right amount of time to get a taste of this lifestyle.\r\n\r\nThe home is exactly as pictured, with perhaps more luxuries than you’d imagine - plenty of soft towels, well equipped mini kitchen, and even warm fleeces and pants if you didn’t pack your own. The bathroom is accessed by the lanai, something that’s hard to understand from the photos, adding a fun novelty to the experience. We loved the comfort of being inside, sheltered from but living with millions of birds, abundant plants, and the sound of rain. Their rainforest garden is the real thing, and we enjoyed the novelty of juicing a few citruses directly from the trees."},{"_id":"24544264","date":{"$date":"2014-12-30T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1206363","reviewer_id":"811389","reviewer_name":"Laura","comments":"we spent three nights at this perfectly calm and amazing piece of earth. we were greeted by Kaeo who was amazingly friendly and helpful. the little house has everything you'll need... and more! we found many complimentary food such as freshly baked cookies, sodas and fruits from the garden.

It is located separately from the main house on the property, with it's own driveway; making it feel like a private cottage (loved that!).

Hilo has the rainbow falls, small beach parks with great snorkeling (we saw 7 sea turtles).

Ah, bliss!\r\n\r\n(Rain is considered a blessing in Hawaii, it is beautiful to hear and see, smell and feel.

The property is beautiful with all the lush greenery and flowers. I fell in love with the place as soon as I saw it - it was clean and I had everything I needed and more. I was delighted to find a delicious ravioli dinner in the fridge waiting to be heated and after Kaeo showed me around and told me where everything was, she came back with a delicious salad. I also had a giant tray of fresh fruits that lasted my entire stay plus tasty cookies and pastries. I loved hearing the sounds of the rainforest and the home had everything I needed for my stay - beach chairs, snorkel gear, boogie boards, beach towels, sunscreen, water and a cooler. \r\n\r\nKaeo and Karl made me feel like ohana and I felt very safe and comfortable right away.

The location is amazing if you are wanting to see the Volcano National Park, there is a Black Sand beach very close in Kalapana about 20 mins away from Eco Hale. The house is very cozy and romantic but definitely only able to comfortably accommodate two at the maximum. Also if you are wanting a resort experience free of culture, a little dirt, and nature you might as well stay in Kona. The Hale is truly off the grid and we couldn't have been happier with it. \r\n\r\nBeing off the grid doesn't mean roughing it though. If you use the (provided) citronella candles on the porch bugs aren't an issue. The hot water is instantly hot, and a full kitchen setup is provided albeit a little unconventional. \r\n\r\nThe hospitality provided for us was unlike anything you could ever dream of at any resort however. Kaeo provided us some treats and sandwiches upon checkin after getting in late and made us feel right at home, even offering to share some tasty Lasagna she had made for herself! We had a little bad luck with the weather pattern as it rained nearly everyday but Kaeo was there to take care of us and made sure we had clean and dry towels. \r\n\r\nBetween the home cooked meals, homemade cookies, homemade bread, and fresh fruit, Kaeo was always there for advice on what to see, tips on the grocery stores nearby, farmers markets, etc, etc. We really did feel like family and cannot wait til our next visit to the Big Island!\r\n\r\n- John and Carrie"},{"_id":"48923407","date":{"$date":"2015-09-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1206363","reviewer_id":"32435422","reviewer_name":"Valeria","comments":"Thank you for the nice hospitality.

It was so dark that we barely could see the car in front of us. It was hard to see the streets and landmarks Kaeo sent on the very detailed directions weeks in advance. So I recommend arriving when there is light. Kaeo was the most amazing hostess. Her first question was if we had dinner and since we said no, she immediately said there was quiche on the fridge and brought us a delicious salad. We had a great dinner inside the cozy cottage. The cottage is very comfortable with a queen size bed, four pilows and lots of covers for the chilly nights. The kitchen is full equipped and the bathroom very spacious - it is a separate room, so you need to go outside and enter the next door. The water is hot and the shower has good pressure. The cottage is totally isolated with a private lanai and garden full of beautiful plants and flowers. The famous banana bread was on the fridge and it was yummy! Next day we got fruit muffins, also yummy. You have to have in mind that you are in the middle of tropical rain forest with the next \"town\" (Volcano village) 30 minutes away. So come with all your adventurous spirit. It was a great experience and Kaeo is really one of the best hostess ever. She thought of every single detail and demonstrated really care for her guests.

We even took our wedding pictures in their topical garden. The tropical garden is beautiful and full of tasty fruits! Kaeo even baked us a banana papaya bread (using ingredients straight from the garden) and it was hands down the BEST banana bread I've ever had! Eco Hale is located in a beautiful rainforest part of the Hawaii and it was a relaxing trip. Coming from a big loud fast paced city the sound of the rain, birds, and animals was just peaceful! We slept with the windows open during our 7 day trip and it was the best sleep I've had in awhile. We really liked that the place is eco friendly.

I had worried it would be too small or remote but for us it was the perfect Hawaiian experience.  Kaeo met us in the drive as if we were old friends coming to visit.  We had communicated by text the day before about our expected arrival time and need to go grocery shopping.  As noticed in other reviews she promised us some vegetable pasta upon arrival saving us a trip from Volcano Village back to Hilo for supplies and allowing for more time to explore the National Park. The grounds around Eco Hale are lush with flora and fauna plus quaint garden art.  We could tell much thought was put into the decor of the Hale, food \u0026 drink treats, and general household items and beach gear available for our use. It was like staying in a Hawaiian playhouse.  We made much use of cooking equipment at night on our little porch after shopping at local Farmers Markets. The above pasta was delish as was fresh banana bread left on the kitchen counter. Garden fruits and other food staples were available in the frig and pantry.  The bathroom was large and there was plenty of hot water and drinking water available.  My husband and I are types who when on vacation are up and out early, back just before dark, and tired from our long day so Eco Hale could not have been a better choice for us.  The location is perfect for exploring the HA Natl Volcano Park and the entire Puna area.  We particularly loved the night sounds, sort of jungle-like.

We wish we could have stayed longer.  We kept in touch with Kaeo and Karl to let them know our flight arrival was a bit late and they were OK with letting us come on ahead.  We arrived after dark and had no problem finding the gate.  If you follow Kaeo's directions exactly and keep an eye out for the numbers on the street pavement as indicated, you won't have any trouble.  We felt welcome as soon as we arrived as Kaeo promptly and graciously introduced herself and handed us a piping hot tureen of delicious vegetable and soba noodle soup, which we devoured.   Kaeo got us all set up with keys and additional information and left us to our own devices.  We sadly didn't meet Karl as he had family in town.  Upon entering the cabin, we were also pleased to find a selection of home-grown and local fruits on the counter that was more than we could eat...but we tried!  Kaeo also brought us a loaf of home baked banana bread (delicious with coffee and fruit in the morning) and cookies for us (which saved us on one of our long hikes in the park).  \r\nThe cabin information and photos that were provided in the listing were accurate, so we knew what to expect.  The main room in the cabin is a fairly small space, which we expected, but was large enough for both my husband and I to move around, prepare meals, eat, read and sleep.  Eco Hale is perfect for a single or couple.  It was very clean, cozy and comfortable.  The kitchenette area is well set up for making your own meals by outdoor gas single cook-top, or indoor microwave, a bar-sized sink, and a small fridge.  There were plenty of kitchen tools, plates, pans, coffee grinder, french press, as well as condiments, coffee beans, teas and other amenities.  The bathroom with shower is separate and spacious with plenty of on-demand hot water and room to change in.  Eco Hale was centrally located between Hilo and Volcano National Park so it was easy for us to move between each location.  We were amazed at the attention to detail in this little cabin from the artistic decorative touches, inspirational quotes, our own personalized welcome sign which made us feel special (thank you!), extra reading materials, local information and to-do recommendations, beach and snorkeling gear, ice chest, recycle bins, drinking water, extra pillows and blankets, a cd player with a box of cds that we enjoyed, internet hotspot, playing cards, a guest book, a hide-away tree platform, and so much more! \r\nAll this is to say, we highly recommend this little gem and these wonderful gracious hosts.

Without question, our fondest memories of the trip are the ones we made here. From the moment we pulled into the driveway, where Kaeo welcomed us as if she had known us our entire lives, we felt the special-ness of the place. The cabin itself is beautiful, clean, and filled with personal touches. It strikes the perfect balance between offering just enough modern convenience to feel luxurious (electricity, hot water on demand, etc.) while eschewing things like television which would detract from the natural beauty and intimacy of the setting. This is truly a place to step back, slow down, and relax. We loved falling asleep to the sound of the rain pitter-pattering on the roof and the frogs chirping outside the windows. Also, the location is ideal for exploring the volcano and the Hilo side of the island, which we ended up far preferring over the Kona side. We met several folks at the Kona resorts who only did day trips to the volcano, and I think that's a tragic mistake. The eastern side of the island is far more lush and beautiful, and offers numerous hikes, vistas, waterfalls, and gardens for those who appreciate that sort of thing. We followed several of Kaeo's recommendations and were not disappointed. In short, we could not recommend Eco Hale more highly, and hope one day to have the opportunity to return."},{"_id":"66146823","date":{"$date":"2016-03-20T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1206363","reviewer_id":"22547441","reviewer_name":"Greg And Anneli","comments":"Mahalo, dear hosts, for this perfect place\r\nFor Eco Hale is truly a sacred space.\r\nIn your rain forest so lush and green\r\nColorful gardens with flowers and fruit wait to be seen.\r\n\r\nIn this cottage so cozy and sweet\r\nYou frequently left scrumptious (many homebaked!) treats\r\nThe tastefully chosen bamboo decor\r\nReflected nature's gifts outside our door.\r\n\r\nOur sensuous showers under the tree canopy nearby\r\nAnd hearty breakfasts indoors OR on the lanai\r\nPrepared us for hiking volcanoes, waterfalls and more\r\nOn this, Big Island's, stunning east shore.\r\n\r\nAnd then, at the end of the day, with YOUR slippers on our feet\r\nWe curled up in our candlelit cabin with your plentiful books so neat\r\nListened to the melodies of tree frogs and birds\r\nAnd fell asleep as the patter of rain was heard.\r\n\r\nWhen we think of Hawai'is beautiful nature\r\nWe will remember what you at Eco Hale nurture\r\nThank you for your ALOHA -- the joyful sharing of life energy --\r\nAnd for Eco Hale, an unforgettable sanctuary."},{"_id":"67160144","date":{"$date":"2016-03-27T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1206363","reviewer_id":"2197816","reviewer_name":"Thomas","comments":"When we arrived in Hawaii after a long and somewhat arduous journey with a 9-month old baby we were welcomed with actual open arms by Kaeo.  She was so kind, caring, and open and we felt instantly at home.  \r\nWe were greeted with a delicious dinner and each day would come home to find mandarins, oranges, lemons, avocados, and delicious home-baked treats at our door step.\r\nBoth Kaeo and Karl were incredibly helpful in planing out stay, and even though we knew we could always go next door to ask them questions, we also felt that we were completely alone and isolated in our little jungle retreat.\r\nThe accommodations were clean, neat, and simple but small, so if you aren't comfortable sharing a small space with your traveling partner know that you'll be in close quarters.  Despite the size the Hale never feels small or cramped and everything is organized so perfectly that you'll wonder why you ever thought you needed so much space!  We loved the experience (and challenge) of our outdoor kitchen and found ourselves cooking delicious meals with local produce and will forever miss our fresh-squeezed juices each morning.\r\nYou're definitely off the beaten path here, so be prepared for some driving (30 minutes and up) if you want to go the National Park, beaches, or into Hilo.  We felt it was well-worth it to do the extra driving.  \r\nIts also good to note that this is an Eco Hale in the Rainforest- so be prepared for rain!  While your days might get wet, falling asleep to the sound of rain and coqui frogs singing can't be topped!\r\nIn short, our time at Kaeo and Karl's was wonderful, special, memorable, and beautiful and we HIGHLY recommend it!"},{"_id":"67818840","date":{"$date":"2016-03-31T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1206363","reviewer_id":"19127416","reviewer_name":"Romana","comments":"Best place you could wish for, not only because of the amazing little place, but also because of the incredible nice hosts!

The surroundings are drop dead gorgeous- a carefully maintained tropical foliage, the sounds of Coqui frogs at night and birds in the morning make the scene almost surreal.

The place is exactly as described in the photos and truly a unique experience for any traveller. We were also spoiled with homemade treats each day, which made us feel loved and cared for. The eco hale has everything that you would need for a rural retreat and so much more. We were pleasantly surprised to see trail guides for the day trips in the Volcanoes National Park, as well as blankets and hot water flasks for night trips to the volcano. Falling asleep to the sounds of crickets and birds and cooking on the patio with the rainforest in full view was also a delight.

Staying at Eco Hale was an experience of lifetime. Not only was it beautiful, but Keao was an INCREDIBLE host. She came to check on us and left us the most delicious baked goods we've ever had, and I'm assuming they were all made with local ingredients because they were amazing. Her banana macadamia but bread was my absolute favorite. We are from the east coast, just outside of New York City, so staying in the heart of the Hawaiian rainforest was truly something we will never forget and treasure forever. Falling asleep to the sound of rain on all the trees and the soothing sound of whistling tree frogs was a memory that we will hold dear to us for years to come. You are a short drive (15-20 minutes) from Kilauea or the town of Hilo in both directions. There are countless outdoor adventures, such as breath taking tide pools, waterfalls, and driving to the top of Mauna Kea (one of the best thing's we've ever seen), and being a short drive away from all these incredible adventures is just perfect. I really have no words for how awesome this experience was. To anyone thinking about staying at Eco Hale... DO IT - you won't regret it!\r\nIf I could give this a 1,000 star rating I would.

The difference with Kaeo and Karl and with Eco Hale, is the true experience of a Bed and Breakfast. There was everything provided from sweats and slippers, to a fully stocked kitchen, to the drinking water tank being magically filled every day, to a thank you note and parting gift at the end. Nothing was missed, and it made us feel welcome, relaxed, and at home far away from home. Even with all of these extras, we did not see Kaeo or Karl during our stay after check-in, and were given the privacy that allowed for a perfect stay.

Kaeo and Karl are amazing. They have everything covered from the accommodations to kitchen utensils to anything else you think you might need. We used the thermoses they had for our early morning trip to go see the lava...perfect!! Kaeo greeted us upon check in and gave us the rundown also shared info on key things in the area and recommendations. She had made us pork tamales and provided green salsa, cheese, and avocado.... so tasty and filling! The accommodations are spot on from the decor to the layout. They provide extra of everything so do not worry. The fresh fruit made for a wonderful breakfast  add on. Fresh baked banana blueberry bread was to die for!!!\n\nI was truly sad to leave..we were only able to stay for two days but the memories will last forever!!!

And happily, just two short years later, we were able to visit again! We love this place so much. And our host, Kaeo. We ADORE her. She is the loveliest. Hospitality incarnate.\r\nThe cottage itself is composed of two rooms: a cozy bedroom with a compact/efficient kitchen space and a bathroom that is impeccably clean with beautiful custom tilework lining the shower walls. The interior spaces spill out onto a small porch with more kitchen space and outdoor seating. There, you're nestled into a lush rainforest-garden, secluded from it all, and connected to the tropical surroundings in a way that can only happen in a place like Mountain View. The frequent rain showers, the warm sunlight through all the green, and the sound of birds and frogs envelope you in a whole new world. \r\nKaeo has appointed every corner of the cottage with things to make your stay comfortable and memorable. Home-baked hiking bars and a beautiful tray of fresh fruit are just two examples of the many \"gifts\" you may find at Eco Hale. Twenty minutes from Volcano (current lava flows are spectacular), the Puna coast (dappled with natural lava-warmed pools and home to one of our favorite things--the Wednesday night-market), and Hilo (a fun town to explore which borders waterfall country) make this location ideal for exploring important must-see sections of the island. We love having Mountain View as our home-base and no doubt we will be returning once again."},{"_id":"111564410","date":{"$date":"2016-10-31T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1206363","reviewer_id":"7290720","reviewer_name":"Alva","comments":"Kaeo is the best host ever.

She is absolutely the hostess with the mostest! She was always so kind and thoughtful towards us -- she left us the sweetest notes/tiny gifts and the yummiest treats from hearty potato soup to homemade turkey sandwiches (for turkey day!). She welcomed us warmly, was flexible, and respectful of our privacy. She was absolutely lovely and beautiful in every way!

She had a snack waiting for us when we arrived and other baked goodies. Since it was raining a lot while we were there, it was really hard for our towels to dry so she would dry them for us and leave them neatly folded on the table outside, in a bag, every night.

Lots of snacks provided, she  was also enormously helpful with things to do! So friendly and free flowing as well! We can't wait to come back!! I felt the location was perfect. The kitchen was well stocked, grills and \"stove\" out on the porch were clean and well working. My only complaint is that it's damp  and feels much colder than it is. Obviously you're in a jungle/rainforest so that's a given but the space only has 3 windows, no heating/air conditioning, fans. So to get fresh air you have too open windows/door and it lets in so much moisture. BUT the water at the space was hot when needed. Bed was springy, neither very soft or hard, lots of extra blankets and pillows. \n\nWe were about 1-2 hours from everything we wanted to do. We went to a black sand beach, hiked the 5 miles round trip to the green sand beach, went to Hilina Pali, and saw snow on Mauna Kea (which is on the way to the airport). We found two health food stores, island naturals in Hilo (a one stop shop!), and Keaau natural foods who has raw macadamia nuts that are out of this world! After the green sand beach there is a yummy Thai place called is lae garden and just up the way a mile or so is a pizza place that advertised gluten free and vegan called DJ pizza. Stop at the kona brewery if you fly into kona. Their food is amazing, strawberry salad and sweet potato pie were A+!! Kaeo gave us great ideas and pointed us in the right direction to find what we wanted to do. She also has huge binders of info in the room of local things and volcanos. Really awesome! She suggested the boat tour for seeing the volcano and lava vs flying.

You don't even need (Hidden by Airbnb) for anything. Everything is right there in the binders. Can only imagine the amount of time they have spent creating those binders and keeping it up to date. But that is not the best part of the hale. Its the location location location. Its in the middle of a rainforest. And you fall off to sleep to the sounds of birds, rain and frogs. Never had a peaceful sleep like this before. It brought back memories of our native place back home. The pictures do not do justice to the Hale. You have to live there to feel it :)\n\nI don't even know how to be grateful to the hosts. We did not get a chance to meet Karl but Kaeo was there to welcome us and was able to accommodate an early checkin request. She is such a wonderful lady to talk to. She is so welcoming and she really wants you to have a great time. We felt like a part of their family. There were fruits, baked goodies for us on arrival. And everyday she would leave something for us on the porch to eat :)\n\nThere is absolutely no reason for you to not stay here if you are visiting Hilo. Like I said, the location is amazing but the hosts are even more amazing. We had the best vacation of our life.

This luxury off-the-grid experience was everything we imagined!

I couldnt believe what I see with my eyes! So beautiful, peaceful, and vivid with colorful trees and singing birds, and also with warm welcoming hug from Aunt Kaeo! She was so beautiful and kind! She explained details about this little 'wonderland' to us when arrival and we started to explore this little house. It is fit for two of us. There was everything we needed. Aunt Kaeo gave us a wine with a sweet memo and we really appreciate it! We could find delicate touches of Karl and Kaeo everywhere and could feel how they pour their love to this house. \nI want to say thank you so much that we had the most amazing days and nights in our life in this Eco Hale.

I went to the store and farmer's markets (plenty to choose from!) for the staples when I wanted to make any sort of meals for my stay which was nice. The fresh fruit, little treats, and yummy meals were a treat I wasn't expecting and they were so yummy!  I didn't meet Karl this trip, but his touches he put on building this beautiful humble abode was perfect. Kaeo is the sweetest and most adorable free spirit and I couldn't have asked for more from her! Her local tips in the binders are perfect and lovely for when you want to check out everything around you and across the Island. Very well put together! If I had a question while across the Island, she responded almost immediately with advice or tips. I loved falling asleep to the local wildlife and rain, as well as waking up to the beautiful sun shine and birds chirping. The tree platform was perfect for when I needed to just soak the sun and relax. Be ready to sit back and just relax with while staying at the Eco Hale.

Kaeo's directions were clear and concise which we greatly appreciated having never been to the Island of Hawaii before. A complementary dinner was provided when we arrive which was homemade and delicious!! Kaeo also made a wonderful banana nut bread for us to enjoy as well! Sweets and treats were provided throughout our stay which helped make us feel welcome and at home. Unlocking/locking the gate to the property was not an inconvenience and helped us feel secure. Eco Hale is beautifully placed in the backyard of Karl and Kaeo's property which allowed for easy communication and quick response to requests. The position and distance between Kaeo and Karl's home from Eco Hale maintained privacy for me and my husband throughout our stay. The bathroom is separate from the bedroom and my husband and I felt comfortable going back and forth in the privacy of Eco Hale. We enjoyed waking up each morning to make French press coffee, hand squeezing fresh orange juice from the juicing oranges on the property, and eating fresh tangerines picked from the trees. The complementary breakfast and stocked mini fridge with juices, yogurt, were a wonderful plus!! Eco Hale is in the rain forrest side of the island which can make nights and mornings chilly in December. Kaeo and Karl provided a few extra sweatpants and blankets hanging up in the closet just incase of colder weather. This closet is filled with useful items! Kaeo and Karl have provided so many items we didn't think we needed. Binoculars, snorkel goggle de-fogger, flashlights, plenty of informational books, beach chairs, beach towels!! The property is gorgeous and filled with all kinds of plants and flowers lining the small trails and garden. The chirps and sounds of the rain forrest nightlife are mesmerizing. Soaking in the OFuro soaking tub was calming and soothing after a day of hiking in HVNP. Kaeo and Karl also encourage recycling and composting, which my husband and I loved!! The 1G wireless was a convenient but also kept cell phone use to minimum. My husband and I wanted a \"no-phone-zone\" so we used the wireless only to research our activities for the next day. The binder provided by Kaeo and Karl was extremely helpful and filled with information about activities to do in Hawaii, appliance guides, items provided in Eco Hale, and more!! We were off on so many adventures throughout the day that Kaeo provided a basket for us to fill for laundry! This was completely unexpected yet so appreciated!!!

Tiki hut...our nickname) that truly immerses you in the Hawaii rainforest. Absolute privacy with only the sights, sounds, feel and smells of the dense growth, birds and occasional rain showers. Nothing better than enjoying a leisurely breakfast of fresh picked frujt, Kaeo's home-baked sweet bread and freshly ground coffee on the open-air bar.  Or capping an action-full day soaking in the Japanese Ofuro tub.\nSecond, Eco Hale's location is perfect. A short drive from Hilo airport, Hawaii Volcanoes NP and the wild and beautiful Puna coast. In the course of our four days, we experienced:\n-- a full day exploring craters, lava flows, lava tubes capped off by a magnificent lava fountain courtesy of Kilauea's lava lake in the evening.\n-- dramatic coastal scenes on the island's eastern coast, ranging from desolate to serene\n-- active lava closing we witnessed in awe by hiking from Kalapana\n-- excellent dining in funky Paula\nThird, Kaeo's warm welcome and boundless hospitality is remarkable. Every possible activity, from snorkeling to Bird-watching to hanging at the beach, has been provided for.  She is truly a sweet soul.\nThank you, K\u0026K!\nMark \u0026 Sharon"},{"_id":"230041650","date":{"$date":"2018-01-26T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1206363","reviewer_id":"144189380","reviewer_name":"Beverley","comments":"We knew we were going to stay in a rain forest, but the week we were there was abnormally rainy.

If you're looking to 'get away from it all' in an exotic rain forest setting while still being close to all the attractions of Hilo, Volcano etc. this is the ideal choice. While the accommodation is relatively small it has everything you could need and more. On top of that, there's the little treats that appear now and then (cookies, chocolates, drinks etc.) even though there's a great selection of food waiting for you when you arrive. While Kaeo provides all of the privacy you could want, she also works in the background to ensure your stay is perfect (taking towels away to dry and responding to requests immediately). A couple of tips; the chirping frogs are all part of being in the rain forest but you might want to bring ear plugs if you're a light sleeper and make sure to check out the night sky while you're there, the number of stars you can see is breathtaking!"},{"_id":"233052742","date":{"$date":"2018-02-07T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1206363","reviewer_id":"154757809","reviewer_name":"Jasmin","comments":"Eco Hale is a magical little gem hidden away in the rainforest.

They are the most wonderful hosts who have put so much thought into the creation of the ultimate home away from home. The hale was easy to get to thanks to the detailed instructions that were sent to me ahead of time. Kaeo met me as I pulled in, proudly showed me around the hale, and welcomed me to contact her with any questions before she gracefully left me on my own. You do need to un/lock the gate to the drive as you come and go off the property but it is easy peasy. The hale itself is separated from the main house by lush greenery so I enjoyed having a lot of privacy and much-needed quiet. The pupu dinner I'd requested was divine, as were the fruit, cookies, and sweet bread that were also left for me to enjoy. The kitchen was perfectly appointed and I loved being able to cook myself breakfast out on the lanai while brewing coffee in a french press. The east side of the island was chillier than I expected and Kaeo graciously provided me an extra comforter and a cozy sweater to borrow. The bathroom is as adorable as one can be and is right next door to the bedroom, making for a lovely experience of a hybrid indoor/outdoor suite in the middle of the rainforest. My first night I took advantage of the Japanese soaking tub and meditated amid candlelight and the symphony of the coqui frogs. The bed was very comfy and I slept like a baby each night. I absolutely cannot wait to return to the Eco Hale and hopefully, will have more time to chat more with Kaeo, who is a dynamic and loving host. Mahalo nui loa, Kaeo and Karl, and much love to you from Seattle until we meet again!"},{"_id":"235202495","date":{"$date":"2018-02-15T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1206363","reviewer_id":"47748200","reviewer_name":"Bryan","comments":"Super cool eco cottage off the beaten path outside of Volcano National Park.

It was very special to have this even after having been at a crowded tourist spot earlier in the day. Definitely my preference over crowded resort spots by a long shot! We are lucky places like this exist, and that people like Kaeo and Karl share them with us. This made our anniversary (and engagement!) very special. I especially loved how they compost, and that everything was off the grid solar! Very cool for these Portland environmentalists.\n\nLiterally the only cons I can come up with: there's a lot of moisture (I mean, you're in a rainforest), so towels practically never dried and I woke up feeling damp at night.

Just be aware, this area is a bit more isolated (about 20m south of Hilo) with spotty cell service, which for us was part of the appeal. But is something to consider when organizing points of interest. \n\nEven though it’s isolated with tons of flowers, lush trees, and plants, we were PLEASANTLY surprised by the lack of bugs. I mean sure there’s mosquitos and the occasional beetle looking thing but we didn’t see much more then that. And overall build quality is incredible! It was pouring rain a good duration of the time we were there and not a single drop or leak was anywhere to be found. \n\nOh and talk about treats and thoughtful touches galore! There was a welcoming meal of lasagna, shrimp Cesar salad, and even a gift since my bday had been a few days prior. \n\nThere’s so much more I’d love to share but it still wouldn’t do Eco Hale justice.

My partner and I fell in love with the place immediately.  There’s nothing like being in the middle of a rain forest, with just the sounds of birds, gentle rain, and the otherworldly sounds of coqui frogs chirping at night.  It was so calming, relaxing, soothing.  A switch goes off in your brain when being there. I wanted to spend as much time as possible there just soaking it in.\n\nIt’s definitely off the beaten path.  After you leave the main highway, it’s still a long ways in.  But of course this is why it’s so remote and quiet.  We barely noticed the main house where Kaeo and Karl live because the property is so lush.  Kaeo gave us a quick tour and some instructions on how to use the furo, stove, etc. and then left us alone to enjoy our little slice of paradise.  Over the next three days we communicated by text message and handwritten notes, and Kaeo would leave us the most ono (delicious) homemade goodies every day.    This was on top of a well-stocked mini fridge and a full water dispenser, and many other amenities.  Kaeo and Karl thought of everything, and then some.\n\nI am a Hawaii resident and have been to the Big Island dozens of times.  My main advice is, don’t try to see all of Hawaii Island in one trip.  Eco Hale is a great location from which to see the volcano area, the small towns in Puna, Hilo, and on up to the middle of the Hamakua Coast.   We also did Mauna Kea as a day trip (staying until sunset).  The driving distances on the Big Island are so great that you do not want to cram too much into a few days, since you would just spend most of your time driving and not nearly enough time enjoying the island lifestyle.\n\nAt Eco Hale the temperature at night was cool, and between the cool air and the coqui frogs, I slept like a baby.  Coqui frogs are controversial in Hawaii.  They were introduced and they spread quickly on Hawaii Island.  Some people are bothered by their chirping, but I’m not one of them.  It just made it feel more like were  in some exotic place in a rainforest.  The feeling reminded me of my travels years ago, when I stayed in off-the-beaten-path places in Bali and Thailand, where the pace of life is so much slower.\n\nIn short, this has been our favorite AirBnb!\n"},{"_id":"303190828","date":{"$date":"2018-08-06T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1206363","reviewer_id":"1871522","reviewer_name":"Aimee","comments":"Kaeo and Karl are top notch hosts!

So the price for the room was actually 125 $, which is close to double from advertised. \nIt is also very far from Hilo, it takes a 40-min-ride to get there, so I can only recommend it, if you want to enjoy the jungle sounds."},{"_id":"323100936","date":{"$date":"2018-09-14T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1206363","reviewer_id":"149155793","reviewer_name":"Rachel","comments":"Amazing and cozy space.

Kaeo greeted us with a Big Aloha and Hug upon arrival. \nAwaiting us in the fridge was a delicious plate filled with abundant shrimp , avocado, coleslaw, fruit and other yummies. Fresh apple bananas as well as papaya was a part of our morning breakfast. There were so many extras provided such as beach chairs, a cooler, snorkeling equipment and even clothing and slippers. The Japanese soaking tub was truly delightful and gazing into the surrounding foliage was mesmerizing.

It is a true labor of love and you get a real sense of the pride they have for this place.  There were fresh flowers everywhere, BESIDES being in the middle of a rainforest garden!  Kaeo prepared a delicious meal for our first night at their place, asking ahead of time what we like and could or couldn't have.  Her communication with stellar!  The whole place was very quaint and fun.  \n\nThe bathroom is not attached to the bedroom, so you have go outside to get to it, but it is three steps away and the place is COMPLETELY ISOLATED and private, so you can move back and forth in your PJs, a towel, or nothing at all without being seen by anyone.  The towels were thick, the bed was comfortable, the space immaculate.  The outdoor area was super inviting.\n\nWe didn't use the outdoor tub because we were always gone in the evening during the hours it is able to be used, but I thought it was an incredibly cool option.\n\nThe space is near Volcano National Park, not too far from the fabulous Botanical Gardens, and you MUST check out the coffee place a couple miles down the main highway toward Hilo!  The coffee is great and the folks are very nice.  Say \"hi\" to Destiny for us!  (She is a young women that recognized us when we returned the second day for more coffee.)\n\nWe had two concerns; the space was quite small.  We have the type of suitcases that have to be laid flat to find anything and we could not open both suitcases at the same time.  This seemed like a big deal the first day, but we grew used to it.  (There is space outside on the porch for a suitcase, but didn't want to have to do that everyday.)  If you are into little spaces or are flexible, you will think this is a very small deal.  We just got a little claustrophobic about it.\n\nThe second thing (and I apologize I didn't say something to Kaeo about this in person) is the shower temperature fluctuates greatly.  I spent more time in the shower waiting for the water to get to a reasonable temperature than I did showering.  (And I'm not too picky about the temperature."},{"_id":"342536284","date":{"$date":"2018-10-28T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1206363","reviewer_id":"27560263","reviewer_name":"Hayley","comments":"Our stay with Kaeo and Karl was nothing short of magical.

The hospitality they show should also be the gold standard for Airbnb hosts - from cooking us an arrival dinner to surprising us with a Christmas gift on Dec 25, they really care about making their guests feel at home in every way possible. \n\nMy only advice would be to consider before booking if you are comfortable with a certain degree of ruggedness. The fact that this eco-hale is in the rainforest means it’s more often than not heavily raining, and the Airbnb receives a number of insects which are harmless but can be annoying when they swarm around you nonetheless. It’s location is also very remote, which lends to its beauty, but also makes it scary driving home on a road with no lights past sunset. \n\nThat being said, these are only minor comments that I feel should be shared with future guests when booking.

It is also within easy reach of two central metro lines although we never once used public transport instead opting to rent bikes from a nearby rental shop (Barcelona is simply one of the best cities to ride in with you pretty much never having having to ride on the road ever!). In any case the main sites of the city are all within easy reach on foot. Its’s a 20 min walk to Place de Catalunya and Gothic Quarters and we very much enjoyed our gentle stroll’s home after a night of eating and drinking. \r\n \r\nSophie herself could not have been more accommodating.

We were thrilled with the apartment - particularly the location.  Walking distance to many interesting sites and very close to the subway. The neighbourhood is bustling and offers a variety of good restaurants, cafes, bakeries and shops, but also has a safe, residential feel. There is a market, grocery store and pharmacy within a 10 minute walk. The apartment is quite big with high ceilings, tons of character, and lovely light.  It is spotlessly clean and well maintained.  Beds are comfortable. There are interesting books, music and movies available for guests. The building was quiet and we rarely saw any other residents. There is a lovely cafe next door that is open early in the morning and late at night - it was a favourite for our kids because the menu includes pizza and hamburgers.  Our host was easily accessible throughout our stay for advice and suggestions.  We loved our stay and are so glad we chose this location.

Everything was extremely comfortable !  It's a very spacious flat with large bedrooms.  Beds very comfortable and all appliances worked extremely well! ( especially washer and dryer).  It was so nice going home with all clean clothes!  Stove and microwave / oven cooked very well.  Refrigerator/freezer were awesome.  \n\nThe location was ideal!  The local market was only a block or two away!  We never walked more than a block before we were able to get a cab.  We woke every morning to beautiful views of the cathedral- Francesco de Sales- lots of windows and natural light. The air conditioning worked so well that we had to turn off and just open windows sometimes.  There was a fan for back bedroom too since it was back and away from the direct air conditioning unit.  Decor was sparse but had all you needed to make the flat feel like your own personality and home.  Very comfortable!\n\nCheck in went smoothly-Dani was waiting there for us with keys as we exited our car from airport.  We were able to check in right away since they had no tenants the night before.  The elevator to flat on third floor worked perfectly!  We were able to get settled and start our adventures right away.  Lots of good restaurants and cafes around Nina's place.  It was located in a very residential area ( we felt like locals) - all neighbors very friendly and kind- even in stores we went to.  We felt like a local but we were about 3-4 blocks from sagrada familia and the other direction was about 6-7 blocks from the most expensive street in Barcelona - passeig de gracia.  We walked about 20-30 minutes to placa de catalunya square everyday- I could write forever but think you get ideal!  I would love to stay here again on our next stay.  Thanks again Nina for your wonderful hospitality!!!

The home is so beautiful (I called it the tree house). The bedroom has everything- TV, fans, zoned air conditioning. The bathroom was awesome too. Everything was very well decorated and very clean. The neighborhood was great. It was in a very private, quiet neighborhood, close to the BRT and the area is very convenient, everything is in a walkable distance if you like walking. \r\n\r\nKayanh home is 35-40 min from the airport by car and 1 hour from Centro Brazil, if you do not mind travelling by public transportation all the tourist areas are accessible.   \r\n\r\nKayanh and his family are the best hosts that you could ever ask for.

You cannot be better located to visit the historic part on foot. The appartment on the top two floors (with elevator) is spacious, comfortable, immaculately clean, well equipped and decorated with taste. Everything was in perfect condition. I thoroughly enjoyed the tranquility of the apartment, you can hear the seagulls and not the cars as the apartment is located at the back side. The highlight is the panoramic window with the breathtaking view on the Douro. This allowed us to have a direct view of the fireworks on the Douro because we were lucky to be there during the Sao Joao (Saint John the Baptist). \nDavid is a responsible and effective host who answered all our questions. Before booking, I needed a lot of information and he always responded promptly and patiently. Upon arrival, we were on the end of a canicule and he bought an air conditioner for us. This was very much appreciated and allowed us to sleep well. I recommend it.\n"},{"_id":"179726417","date":{"$date":"2017-08-08T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1209353","reviewer_id":"19643724","reviewer_name":"Yahya","comments":"David was a great host and the shining view is in an amazing location 5 mins to the center definitely going bk again"},{"_id":"273250281","date":{"$date":"2018-06-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1209353","reviewer_id":"16018160","reviewer_name":"Alex","comments":"Wonderful apartment with beautiful views of the river and city.

Since the appartment is in the city center there is no fabulos view from none of the windows - but this does not matter at all.\r\n \r\nThere is also a Nespresso coffee machine in the modern kitchen (bring the capsules by your one or there is a Nespresso shop 100m away).\r\n \r\nWe can fully recomand this special appartment and Lluis as perfect host in this wunderful city.\r\nMuchos gracias Lluis!!\r\n \r\nMarcella and familiy\r\n\r\n *   * \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDas Appartment ist in unmittelbarer Nähe vom öffentlichen Verkehr und der grossen Einkaufsstrasse \"Passeig de Gràcia\" mit unzähligen Läden, Cafes und Restaurants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIdeal für einen Sightseeing-Aufenthalt in Barcelona, da zentral gelegen (ca. 10 min zu Fuss zur Plaça Catalunya, 2 min zum Taxi-Stand und Bus-Haltestellen).\r\n\r\n\r\nWir waren zu 5. für drei Tage in Lluis Wohnung und haben uns sofort sehr wohl gefühlt. Lluis war bei der Schlüsselübergabe bereits vor Ort und hat uns gute Tipps für Barcelona gegeben. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDie Wohnung ist neu renoviert, modern eingerichtet und hat wunderschöne alte Böden und Stuckaturen in manchen Zimmern.\r\n\r\nEs hat eine automatische Lüftung: Die Temperatur kann manuell eingestellt werden (sehr angenehm).\r\n\r\nDer verglaste Raum („Wintergarten“) ist ein zusätzlicher Raum mit Aussicht auf den Innenhof (die Aussicht ist jetzt nicht wirklich atemberaubend, aber es ist sehr gemütlich). Eine schöne Aussicht gibt es von keinem Fenster aus, da sich die Wohnung Mitten in der Stadt befindet - Stört aber nicht.\r\n\r\nEs hat eine Nespresso-Kaffee-Maschine (Kapseln selber mitbringen oder 100m von der Wohnung gibt’s einen Nespresso-Shop).\r\n\r\n\r\nWir können die Wohnung und Lluis als Gastgeber nur weiterempfehlen.\r\n\r\nMuchos gracias Lluis!!!\r\n\r\n\r\nMarcella and familiy\r\n"},{"_id":"7930729","date":{"$date":"2013-10-08T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1211274","reviewer_id":"9042138","reviewer_name":"Guillermo","comments":"Apartment´s location is top, just off Passeig de Gràcia.

It's in a great location, and we (4 adults and a 15 month old) were very comfortable there.  Luis was able to provide us with a crib, high chair, and lots of toys for the baby to play with.  The water pressure in the showers is wonderful, and we never had an issue with hot water.  The gallery turns into a balcony with the doors open, so we were able to enjoy our evenings out there with a glass of wine.  Luis was very responsive both before and during our stay, answering any questions we had.\r\n\r\nA couple of potential issues:  The interior of the apartment is very quiet, but there is quite a bit of street noise in the two main bedrooms.  Luckily, none of us had an issue with sleeping through it.  (The third bedroom is located along the interior atrium, so traffic noise wasn't an issue in there.)  The elevator is quite small - we had to collapse the stroller to get it in, then only one person and the stroller could ride the elevator, while someone else would have to carry the baby up or down the stairs (or wait for the elevator to come back).  Neither of those things bothered us, though, and we would still recommend this apartment to anyone staying in Barcelona!\r\n\r\n(One trick we learned towards the end of our stay - even though the Passage de Gracia Metro station is a bit closer, it's a mess to navigate.  Try walking an extra block to the Diagonal station - so worth it!)"},{"_id":"48865056","date":{"$date":"2015-09-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1211274","reviewer_id":"31812008","reviewer_name":"Aaron","comments":"This was possibly our best air BnB accommodation yet. The location was PERFECT! Just off the main road and walking distance to la rumbla. Bus stops and taxi ranks on the corner. Hotel Majestic 20 metres away for awesome rooftop drinks. A unique little bar across the road with a great vibe. The apartment itself is very funky! One of the owners is an architect with extremely good taste so we felt really special hanging out in the apartment. Super clean, all modern facilities, fantastic furnishings and features. And the wifi was really good! (we had experienced some really slow connections in other cities of Europe this trip). 5 of us slept very comfortably. The day before we arrived we were told they had just installed double glazed Windows in the bedrooms as some previous guests mentioned they could hear street noise. This has obviously worked perfectly, as we could not hear a thing at night. Lluis left us a detailed laminated map with all the recommended places for supermarkets, breakfast locations bars etc which really helped us find our way around. 35€ in a taxi from the airport which wasn't too bad either, with Lluis waiting out the front to greet us upon arrival.

Best location, bright and airy, stylishly furnished to a very high standard, with kind and friendly hosts, what more can one ask for?\n\nSome background: I have stayed in perhaps a dozen Airbnb apartments before: 1 in New York, the rest all in Europe. This is possibly the best apartment of all the ones I stayed in. In doing research I see many guests say their apartments are well located -- well that's because they havent stayed at THIS apartment! Not only is it close to 2 metro stations and several bus lines, it is just half a block away from Passeig de Gracia and within 4 minutes walk of 3 modernist buildings (2 of which are Gaudi landmarks), and close to a throng of good restaurants.  I didnt even take the metro on most days and just walked instead. Extremely safe neighbourhood and apartment. \n\nThe apartment boasts high ceilings and original signature tiles and *beautiful* ceiling relief details (from like 90 years ago but all well maintained and kept very well and EXTREMELY CLEAN). Makes you feel like living in a historic building, renovted with latest modern comforts. Kitchen all fitted with BOSCH appliances. Master en-suite bathroom is 5-star hotel standard and large, with good water pressure and plentiful hot water. Entire apartment tastefully furnished and decorated (Luis works in construction and his wife is an architect, it is obvious they both brought their professional expertise in refurbishing this apartment). I stayed during December so the enclosed terrace was fantastic as it allows full benefit from the light but one can still enjoy the lofty space without being cold as it is enclosed by glass. In the summer the floor-to-ceiling windows can be opened to fully enjoy the weather.  \n\nWell equipped, heating works well. Cleaned by a professional cleaning company and is Very Clean (explains the high cleaning fee!). This apartment can truly host 6 people and not feel crammed and still leave adequate social space (some apartments claim they can hold 6 people but actually cannot comfortably host more than 4!). \n\nSome older reviews talked about noise issue. About 3 months ago Luis put in triple glazing (yes, the third layer, hence TRIPLE glazing) so the bedrooms are totally quiet now. From talking to other travellers in Barcelona I understand many well located apartments suffer from noise issues (quite inevitably), but this apartment doesn't! \n\nThe building has a lift but there are 9 steps before you get to the elevator. Not a problem unless someone in your party has mobility issues. \n\nI would definitely want to stay here again should I return to BCN. Highly recommend!

The location is superb! Two minutes to the subway, 50 meters to the Gracia street, four minutes to Casa building, we even walked back from Nou Camp stadium after the  game. The room is clean and has a well equipped kitchen, we did breakfast every morning, and late night snack for the kids after a long touring day. The two families sitting together to have a meal in a foreign apartment was really nice experience.\n\nAnd there are three bedrooms and there is a window in each and every room, we all had good sleep in the 6 days of our stay. \n\nI will definitely recommend this apartment to all. The host is very responsive and considerate, very easy to communicate. \n\nThe rest is for my Chinese folks. :) 这个公寓很赞!在巴萨最繁华的地段,从机场转一趟地铁就可以到,大约40分钟,下地铁走几百米就到了｡走一条街就有一家中餐馆,味道还是可以的,我们连吃了两晚｡从这里去米拉之家和巴特罗公寓只要5分钟,走到圣家堂和毕加索博物馆只要25分钟,走到波盖利亚集市可以坐地铁,两站路,走路也只要25分钟｡看完巴萨的球赛,我们走回来花了50分钟,边走边逛也不累,打车过去也只要10欧不到吧｡出门到格拉西亚大街的Armani店门口就可以坐outlets的大巴车,很方便｡\n\n公寓有三间房,一件大床代独立的卫生间,两间小房间,有两张单人床,如果是两个家庭,有点小尴尬,因为有一家两口子要分开睡单人床｡:)厨房里啥都有,佐料和油都提供,电磁炉其实还是比较好用的,习惯就好｡我带了方便面,早餐都是鸡蛋,面包,方便面｡\n\n祝你们入住愉快｡"},{"_id":"132795828","date":{"$date":"2017-02-19T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1211274","reviewer_id":"12942131","reviewer_name":"Thomas","comments":"Nice apartment very close to Paseig the Gracia, the heart of \"chic\" Barcelona.

It was large enough for our group and well laid out. The bathrooms were nice and I was glad to have the soaking tub in the master bedroom after days of 15+ miles of walking (soaking the feet were the only thing that helped!). We barely used the kitchen as we ate out at all of the fantastic restaurants so close by, but we appreciated that it was stocked. Having a washer and dryer in the unit was amazing. We hadn't planned on washing anything but after an accidental spill of coffee down my jacket while walking one day, it was nice to have.\n\nThe beds and pillows were comfy -- which is incredibly nice when you are traveling and exhausted each day. \n\nLocation can't be beat -- walk out your front door and you are at Passeig de Gracias and 2 blocks from Casa Batllo. You can also walk a mile to the Gothic District which was pretty quick.\n\nArea is super safe and felt fine walking home very late at night.\n\nHighly recommend.\n\nPS. We had a snafu with the key to the apartment and the battery died for the door. Called Lluis and he promptly came to the apartment around 8pm. Had to get a locksmith out and everything. We were tired and exhausted but we went downstairs and got a few beers and within an hour and a half, it was fixed. Lluis picked up our tab and got us into the apartment so we could shower and go to bed. I was pleased with how he handled it and was very nice and helpful.

The master bedroom was comfortable but the other 2 bedrooms would be a little tight if two people with large luggages each stayed in either. \n\nThe kitchen had sufficient equipment for making simple meals.

The convenience of the flat was brilliant, we could just jump on the bus at the end of the road and head straight to town on the 333. Because we were blessed  with a week of blue sky and sunshine ( in July !!! ) most mornings we would just walk to bondi junction and grab breakfast / coffees then head for the trains. We felt really at home and relaxed each night taking in the views. The kitchen has everything you could ask for to whip up an evening meal which we did most nights. Both runners my partner and I ran most mornings around the park ( directly opposite ) then down to the beach tracks and back up bondi road to the flat, great work out and really fun running around the bays.  Would love to stay again if we get the chance and would recommend to all.

You're only a couple of minutes walk to the train station while not being far from a bunch of beaches including Bondi. \r\n\r\nThe place itself is nice, the lounge is big with really comfy couches and good TV set up.

The kitchen has more frypans, pots and utensils than a Masterchef final and the hosts offered that we could use their spices etc. They even left chocolate biscuits and a bottle of wine! \r\n\r\nBedrooms are spacious and heaps of linen and towels provided.

They were very communicative and helpful, and set the place up to be very welcoming to our family. The apartment is very clean with beautiful views of the ocean and Sydney. The location is great! It is directly across the street from Waverley Park, which quickly became our kids favorite hang out spot. It was great for my husband and I too, because we were able to get coffee and great quality breakfast at the kiosk there. We were also walking distance to the shopping center, grocery shopping, and restaurants. It is also in the delivery zone of some really great restaurants. Bondi Beach is close and was a total hit with the kids. Having laundry in the unit was very helpful for us for our long stay. In addition to television options, there were also many movies including movies for our kids to watch, which was helpful.\r\n\r\nThe location is great, and doesn't require the use of a car to get around. If bringing a car, it is helpful to know that the parking on the premises is labeled as visitor parking with a four hour time limit during the day. It seems like it isn't really enforced and we had no trouble parking there for longer. There is also street parking on the block, which can be crowded during some hours of the day, but parking generally is pretty easy to find either on site or close to it. \r\n\r\nWhen we first arrived, the elevator was broken and we had to take the stairs up the apartment. Eduardo and Yvonne were very communicative regarding this issue, which ended up being resolved very quickly and was not an issue at all for rest of our stay. It seems that Eduardo and Yvonne are very responsive to guest issues as they arise.\r\n\r\nOverall, our stay in Sydney was a great experience, and I think that Eduardo and Yvonne's apartment was a great base from which to explore the city. \r\n\r\n"},{"_id":"8343608","date":{"$date":"2013-10-27T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1211285","reviewer_id":"9362308","reviewer_name":"Alessio","comments":"The reservation was canceled 34 days before arrival.

Getting up in the morning and walking into the lounge is a great start to any day, looking over Waverley Park to the ocean, fantastic. \r\nIf you plan on seeing Sydney and the surrounding area you could not pick a better location. A short walk to Bondi Junction station where trains and buses will take you wherever you want to go. Both Bondi beach and Tamarama beach ( a bit quieter) are only 10-15 mins walk away. Plenty of shops, cafes and restaurants within the immediate vicinity with the easy option of going further afield from the Junction. \r\nAll in all we had an amazing three weeks and there is no doubt the apartment for both its interior and location helped make that possible. \r\nI would highly recommend this apartment to anyone looking for great accommodation in a fantastic location."},{"_id":"30644126","date":{"$date":"2015-04-25T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1211285","reviewer_id":"27898899","reviewer_name":"Arto","comments":"Erinomainen sijainti. \r\nHyvät kulkuyhteydet Sidneyn keskustaan bussilla ja junalla sekä Bond Beachin bussilla ( kävellen 12 min).

A bottle of wine and some biscuits were there to welcome us.\r\n\nThe place listed a single bed that converted into a king size bed. It doesn't and is more of a child bed. Not great for our adult son who stayed with us. Rather a long list of do \u0026 don'ts (don't wear shoes, don't open certain windows, do put on humidifier, do open doors,  caution with worktops etc) suggested a higher standard of apartment than  it turned out to be. The cooker and facilities were not brilliant and no seating on the balcony as shown in the photos).\r\n\nWhile not bad it is basic and we were very put off cooking when we found rotting food in the microwave.

The flat was cozy and clean, 5 mins walk to the beach and amazing restaurants: I loved BrownSugar right in front of their place. Staying here depends on what you are doing in Bondi. If it's to party and enjoy the nearby festivities until the wee hours of the night then this is perfect for you. I have to say that this place was a little too loud for my taste.

I did appreciate the complementary beach items for us to use from the room, including boogie boards, snorkeling gear, beach mats and chairs. The location and price were the main reasons for my choice of stay. It's close to Waikiki beach and relatively cheaper than what I've seen in the same area.\r\n\r\nMy overall experience was decent.

Checkin was last minute on our part but Chris made it easy for us. .....The location of the Airbnb is great, just a 2 minutes walk to Waikiki and in the middle of Cafes, restaurant, shops, bus stations. That also means that it was pretty loud sometimes during the night, but especially in the morning. So bring your earplugs....Another good thing was, that there is snorkeling gear provided......  In the pictures the airbnb appears bigger than it actually is, more modern and cleaner. I would not title the Airbnb \"clean\". There was hair laying around, one day we had some insects, dust/dirt underneath the kitchen and the bed, old tub/doors/walls that didn´t make it seem hygienic....We have stayed for two weeks. Cooking was a challenge with two burners on the stove and a small kitchen. We couldn´t find all kitchen utensils we needed (e.g. saladbowl).... So there are both pros and contras.

There is no reason someone showing up at 10:30pm after an 11am checkout, should be arriving at a dirty apartment. Chris answered me instantly and remedied the situation. So no fault of his.

This studio apartment is exactly what a budget-conscious traveler needs for a stay in Waikiki. It is not a luxury room and does need updating.   So if you're looking for fancy, pay $200 more a night and go 1 block up. However if you are looking for a place to rest your head (WITH AIR) after fun days checking out the island, this is the place. The location can't be beat. Cheap eats all around and easy walk to shopping, car rental and activities. The beach is literally 2 blocks down. The studio has all you need to eat in if that is your plan but we only used the fridge.  The studio also has a tiny lanai with a partial mountain view. It's sufficient for a nice break to read or drink coffee. The minimart was great for quick drinks and a smoothie. And they even held our bags while we spent our last day enjoying the beach due to our late flight out.

When we finally got ahold of him, he was very apologetic and quick to rectify the situation to the best of his ability. He was a great host and overall, we would be so happy to stay here again! This place is in such an AMAZING spot! Literally walking distance to EVERYTHING! We're talking 2 minutes to Waikiki Beach, 8 minutes to the zoo, less than 10 minutes to countless restaurants! It's a great space! I wouldn't suggest more than 2 people as it is VERY small but it's really pretty! Definitely worth every cent! There's a small balcony to hang up wet swim gear (they loaned us snorkeling gear and boogie boards!) Which is super helpful!

It is at the heart of Waikiki and walking distance from many restaurants, beautiful beach parks, zoo, etc. The apartment is the same as seen in the pictures and for us was very nice because Chris has baby gadgets (crib, stroller, high chair) and also umbrella, bodyboards, beach chair… However, we had a major issue during our check in process. The keys were not in the lockbox as directed by Chris and it was 10 pm. We informed our late checkin since the beginning. We tried to reach him many many time and he didn't answer the phone. AirBnB solved the issue once we found a nearby hotel to sleep that night. It was a challenge because it was Friday, almost midnight, on a holiday weekend with a baby waiting outside. It took us more then 2 hours to find a place. The next day, Chris send a message with new directions, but it was wrong again - wrong key in the lockbox. We called again and his partner showed up with the keys finally getting us inside the apartment. The remaining days were OK. Airbnb payed our night at the hotel and Chris offered a discount - he refunded a little bit over the value of the first night that we did not sleep in his place."},{"_id":"198009068","date":{"$date":"2017-09-27T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12135865","reviewer_id":"5754533","reviewer_name":"Christine","comments":"Room was exactly what we needed, and the AC was great in cooling the space.

Communication with Chris was also very good. However, as most of the reviews mentioned, the check-in process was a hassle and I had to be on the phone with Chris to get the right key to my room as the cleaners had placed the wrong one in the lock box. Hopefully, Chris will improve the check-in process in the future. I also felt the cleaning fee was a bit high for an old building with a bathroom in clear need of a remodel. In addition, there was cigarette smoke seeping through the bathroom window every day making it difficult to breath. Therefore, if you're allergic this may not be a place for you.

There is also Free street parking along Ala Wai Canal 2-3 blocks away. Towing on canal is 2 days, Monday and Friday 6-10am. But who needs a car in Waikiki? Everything is in walking distance. But if you have an itch to venture out, the island's bus transit system is awesome.","access":"Located on-site are a 24-hour convenience store, internet cafe, laundromat, tour desk, surf shop and public parking are available on-site.

We really enjoyed the proximity and convenience to the beach and there were several ABC stores within a 2 minute walk for food and drink, etc. Also highly recommend Wang Chung’s for karaoke around the corner and Honolulu coffee at the Moana Surfrider for the best coffee. The suite is rather small. For folks on a budget, it will be fine. Check in was easy.  This was not my favourite building in Waikiki by any means, but we spent most of the time at the beach anyway, or shopping and not in the suite. Air conditioner was loud, and bed not all that comfy. Liked that Chris provided us with little soaps, and such. Fluffier pillows and cotton sheets as opposed to microfiber would have made the sleep a bit better. Enjoyed the sun and sand and Waikiki atmosphere. So close to the heart of it all!

The living room balcony opens to the street, with the accompanying street noise, which we loved during the day, and closed out at night.  Because the main bedroom in this two bedroom apartment has a balcony to the quiet interior courtyard, we could leave it open for air without noise.  The bed was pretty uncomfortable and wiggled on the frame with any movement, but there was a nice closet and a full-length mirror in the room.  The kitchen is nicely laid out, as is the bathroom.  The bathroom is a tight squeeze between the toilet and the cabinet, and the entry door only opens to about 15 inches, but is just fine for an average size person and the cabinet had enough space for our toiletries."},{"_id":"210590262","date":{"$date":"2017-11-10T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1215049","reviewer_id":"75867461","reviewer_name":"Максим","comments":"Отличное место, все достаточно близко, удобные апартаменты.

Das war die siebte Unterkunft in Folge, auf unserer Spanienreise. Die Wohnung von Elisabet ist eine Absteige und das Geld nicht wert! Wir sind sehr enttäuscht und haben die Unterkunft nach einer Nacht verlassen, obwohl wir 3 Nächte bezahlt haben. Es roch unheimlich penetrant und durchdringend nach künstlichem „Jasminduft“, wohl von einem überdosierten Raumspray..! Grauenhaft! Die Wohnung verfügt zwar über eine Klimaanlage im Wohnzimmer und über je einen portablen Heizkörper in den Schlafzimmern, doch war es nicht möglich, diese auf eine angenehme Zimmertemperatur zu kriegen, es war deutlich unter 20 Grad Celsius, für Februar ein NO GO! Die Sauberkeit allgemein lässt zu wünschen übrig. Die Küche war schmuddelig, die Frottétücher zwar gewaschen aber stinkig. Vorhänge und Sofaüberwurf haben ebenfalls schlecht gerochen. Überall viel Staub unter den Betten, in den Ecken und unter dem Fernsehmöbel, hier wurde, wenn überhaupt, nur sehr oberflächlich gereinigt! Auf den Fotos im Inserat wird geflunkert. Die Fenster im Zimmer mit einem Bett, der Küche, dem Bad und dem Entree gehen in das Treppenhaus, es gibt also kein Tageslicht und keine Luft. Was an dieser Unterkunft gut ist, ist die Lage und das WLAN. Zusammengefasst, ein Flop, nicht empfehlenswert."},{"_id":"234312490","date":{"$date":"2018-02-12T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1215049","reviewer_id":"36707322","reviewer_name":"Lana","comments":"Added to our special stay in Barcelona!

Besonders toll fanden wir das warme Bettzeug (für verwöhnte Märzmenschen), nicht ganz optimal das quietschende Einzelbett, weshalb der dritte (erwachsene) Gast lieber auf dem Sofa übernachtete - was als Alternative super funktioniert hat.

Close to everything, but not overrun by tourists. We felt very lucky to have chosen the apartment from all the many choices available in Barcelona. The apartment is just off of a pedestrian street by Sagrada Familia. There were many bakeries and tapas bars to choose from and it was very easy to find great and affordable food. Because of this, we didn't use the kitchen once. \nSome reviews mention street noise, but that was not an issue AT ALL as the bedroom was set in the rear of the apartment and well off the street.

They made wonderful local recommendations, and were super accommodating and flexible with check-in and check-out. The apartment is in a great neighborhood with some local-feeling places, and a quick walk to the famous Sagrada Familia.

I'm not a light sleeper, but I stayed on a Saturday night, and the volume of the music from the bar downstairs was extremely loud. I did not sleep at all.

Mit öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln, auch vom Flughafen aus, sehr gut zu erreichen (Haltestelle Taksim-Platz). In direkter Nachbarschaft unzählige Bars, Restaurants, Geschäfte und Clubs, die zu Fuß problemlos erreicht werden können. Selbst die Sehenswürdigkeiten in der Altstadt kann man mit einem ausgiebigen Spaziergang (ca. 30 - 40 Min.) zu Fuß erreichen. So erhält man einen schönen Einblick in das Stadtleben der einzelnen Viertel. Kann ich nur empfehlen! \r\n\r\nCheck-In und -Out absolut problemlos. Einfach in der Bar melden.

The room smelled strongly of smoke.  I could hear people's conversations in the bar whilst I was in the bedroom because the room is directly above the bar.

However if you go to sleep earlier, then it will be difficult as the music is loud.\nAlthough I knew it would be loud and lively above a bar, I was not prepared to be woken up by other guests arriving during the night because of the thin walls, and to stay in a room constantly smelling of smoke.

Since we stayed there previously we had requested a specific room and were told our request would be granted.  However when we arrived our requested room was not available and it was the only one with a balcony.  The hosts went above and beyond to try and accommodate us including finding another place to stay with a balcony.  We only stayed one night and ended up switching hotels, but they even helped us with our luggage and carried it on a 15 minute walk to the other hotel.  They did not have to do this and I was really surprised at how accommodating and friendly they were.  Even though we ended up switching places I would still come back and stay at the Raven again since the hosts are first class and I don't fault them for the mixup.  Our remaining fee for the other nights was refunded and they even followed up a week later to make sure our funds had cleared to make sure we got our refund.  You just don't see this honesty every day and we hope to come back and visit next time.

That means loud music and people till 3 a.m. The stairs in the stairway are out of metall. Whenever somebody walks up or down the stairs, the whole house will here it. As the stairs are also used by costumers of the pub, it is very loud till late at night. During our stay there were also builders for two days, hammering and sawing for hours. Host was not helpful when approaching him on this.\n\nYou smell smoke in the room and the towels, though there is a \"please don't smoke\" sign.\n\nPro: Raven's place is located very convenient close to Istiklal and Taksim.

There was a lack of towels and bedding, couldn't get the tvs to work, had to ask for wi-fi code . Also the kitchen' is very basic. A fridge and just a kettle and cups and glasses with no plates, knives, spoons or forks provided and no toaster or microwave.

Second, there was neither shampoo nor shower gel, there was only a small hand soap available. Finally, the walls and windows' insulation was inaccurate for the music from the bar downstairs playing till 7 in the morning (but I was prepared for that :) ).

The apartment is quite dark and a bit gloomy (it's not luxury, it's well lived in modern) but it is perfect for two people who enjoy being in the thick of it and go out a lot at night. The bar downstairs is good fun and run by lovely people. Our room was on level two and the bedroom wall is shared with a neighbouring club who play loud music from 11pm - 4am seemingly every night (the city never sleeps!). I live in the inner city back home and normally sleep like the dead but this level of noise made the bed vibrate and we had awful sleepless nights. Following complaints and two restless nights, we were moved off site to another hotel. I can't speak highly enough of the staff at Raven. We were treated incredibly well and it made the experience worth it. So I would recommend Raven for people who love the nightlife amd can tolerate excessive noise from the neighbours."},{"_id":"341938064","date":{"$date":"2018-10-28T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1215226","reviewer_id":"219939108","reviewer_name":"Semih","comments":"rahatlıkla güvenılebıle"},{"_id":"344236143","date":{"$date":"2018-11-03T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1215226","reviewer_id":"157359445","reviewer_name":"Lara","comments":"The apartment is great!

The location is amazing, I loved the decoration and the place was spotless and wasn’t nearly as noisy as described by the other reviewers. The only thing that really left a bad taste on my mouth was the fact the host entered our room without communicating it to us first. We came back from outside and there were new towels new sheets etc. In an airbnb I don’t expect room service so I just leave my stuff around (underwear, money etc.). If I had been asked I would have said no thank you, I don’t want any room service. This also made me question if they were there before. Maybe other people won’t think this is a big deal but I would have very much liked to be advised beforehand.\n\nBurada kaldigimiz ilk uc gece burayla ilgili tek bir kotu sey soyleyemem diye dusundum cunku yeri harika, dekorasyon da cok guzel ve asla soylenen kadar gurultulu degil. Dorduncu gecemizde beni rahatsiz eden sey su oldu: disardan geldigimizde odamiza biz yokken host tarafindan girilip yeni havlu vs koyulmus oldugunu gorduk. Ben normalde airbnblerde oda servisi gibi bir beklentiye sahip olmadigim icin esyalarimi baskasinin gorecegi kaygisi olmadan birakiyorum. Eger bana sorulmus olsaydi da oda servisi istemedigimi belirtirdim ama sorulmadi. Haberim olmadan odama girilmis olmasi beni gercekten cok rahatsiz etti.

The apartment has a small pub downstairs that has a nice selection of beers available and live HD football. This location is definitely not for a light sleeper, even with earplugs. There is a live music venue directly adjacent to apartment block and you are likely to hear the sound of guitars and drums. Throughout our week here, this noise was present from midnight til 6:00 am every day and in one case til 9:00am on the 2nd Jan. After finally getting to sleep, on 2 occasions I was woken by a delivery of beer kegs that were dropped on the bottom of the metal spiral stairs. Unfortunately this resonates throughout the entire apartment block. You are spoilt for choice in the city with restaurants so don’t feel like you need to jump in the first place you see. You can wander around the side streets and restaurants are in abundance.

Not to mention coffee, creamer, sugar and filters for the machine. I even saw a candy jar;)\n\nEverything was very new \u0026 very clean. The decorative touches are great. A vase of fresh hand picked flowers on a table meant a lot to my wife Lisa. \n\nEach day we had our coffee and breakfast on the lanai overlooking the scenic hilltops and a pasture with a few sheep and a calf. The birds were singing and roosters chimed in too. \n\nOne day we had planned a hike not far from the house, but the weather was quite foggy. However, foggy weather equals romantic snuggle weather! Needless to say we made the most of it with a bottle of wine, a roaring fire, and by enjoying our lovely accommodation!! The next day we woke up early, hiked, drove around on a few side roads to enjoy the scenery of beautiful Waimea and stopped at some local farmer markets. There are stores close by to get a few groceries,  and quite a large array of restaurants too. \n\nWe took this nice little break from our own Vacation Rental, to enjoy Waimea which is about an hours drive for us.

It's perfectly situated in Park Slope Brooklyn half a block away from the subway and in a very safe neighborhood, the apartment itself was great, very spacious and comfortable. Anyone thinking of coming to NY would be silly to pay the price for a hotel when you can have all the comforts of home at more than half the price. Would highly recommend Liz's apartment to anyone who wants to be near NYC. World trade center, Macy's, Time Square and Central Park are all on the train line less than a block away, no need to even transfer to other trains. And the neighborhood was wonderful with plenty of shops, bars and restaurants there was even  an English bar a few blocks away!,  Liz was great, any questions we had were promptly answered and Allie the cat was so cute, All in all a great place to stay a great location and would go back for sure."},{"_id":"1253127","date":{"$date":"2012-05-09T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"121861","reviewer_id":"1991381","reviewer_name":"Irene","comments":"Our family of 4 adults spent a fantastic long weekend celebrating a milestone occasion in NYC, staying at Liz's apartment as our home base.

Both rooms and the living room have big windows that let in a lot of light. The apartment is clean and comfortable, and the subway I'd right on the corner (R line). With only one stop you're in Atlantic avenue station, where you can connect with many other lines.\r\nThe only reason I'm not giving five stars is because of some noise from the upstairs apartment. It seems that some children live there and we could sometimes hear they running around. It wasn't overbearing but it did wake me up than I wanted to one morning, so I reckon it's worth one star.

As a family, it has the feeling of being at home without the confines of a hotel room and having the secure street entry door gave my wife extra peace of mind.

Nous n'avons pas rencontré Elizabeth, mais elle avait laissé dans l'appartement beaucoup de renseignements qui nous ont été fort utiles et a toujours été très réceptive dans nos échanges. L'immeuble est à quelques minutes à pied de la station Union Street (ligne R qui dessert Brooklyn et Manhattan) et on accède en 15 mn à pied à Prospect Park. Malheureusement, suite à l'ouragan Sandy, le passage sous l'East river est en travaux jusqu'en novembre 2014 et il faut changer de ligne pour accéder à Manhattan.

Algo lejos del centro, a unos 25 minutos andando, pero con autobuses muy cerca. A pesar de que no dejamos nada en el auto sufrimos un intento de robo y la rotura de una ventana del coche, según los vecinos y la policía que acudió no es un hecho excepcional, hubiésemos agradecido una advertencia.\nNuestro checking se demoró más de una hora por un mal entendido con los encargados de nuestra anfitriona el checkout lo hicimos sin que nadie se hubiese personado. Por otro lado la anfitriona nos ofreció su ayuda en todo momento cuando sufrimos el robo, aunque ya lo habíamos resuelto.

Restaurants in waikiki are wonderful but \"a little bit\" expensive (we are two people and we have never paid less than 100 $ for a dinner,  eating only main courses and desserts and drinking water ). Fortunately we could cooked at home some food for our breakfasts and lunches saving in this way a lot of money!The reserved parking included is another added value. If you really want to enjoy the Island, you must have a car!daily parking rate in hotel or private garage goes from 15 to 30 $ in Waikiki!Having a free parking just near your house is really convenient.\nWe didn't meet Lei personally but his instruction about how to get the apartment's key and to leave the house at the end of the vacation have been clear and exhaustive.

I say this because I was staying with my wife and son. The apartment definitely has awesome potential to make it feel more lively or inviting if they upgraded the apartment, example instead of putting a patio outdoor table set inside maybe have a nice dining table with chairs. Air condition needs an upgrade, a little too noisy. The apartment does look exactly like what the picture shows.  But other than that the beds and sheets were clean and so was the bed.

We saw that the reviews were great, however our experience was anything but. Unfortunately, we were in the room a total of 30 minutes before we called air bnb to cancel and get a refund. \n\nWhen we walked into the condo, you could immediately smell a strong odor of mold and the air was very thick. We were tired from traveling so we tried to take a little nap, but within 20 minutes of being in there we were both coughing, had sore throats and headaches. Even the sheets smelled like mildew. I checked around the room and bathroom to see if there was any visible mold, and found spores around the A/C unit and a large area of black mold on the wall right outside of the window. It also looked like the corner of the wall, close to the ceiling by the window had been wiped clean and mold residue was sort of smeared around.\n\nI have respiratory issues, so once I realized that there was mold in the unit, I became very concerned. \n\nWe referred back to the host's listing and messages they sent, and they stated \"* If you call us, we may be a charge fee.\"\nThat in itself is ridiculous. They sent us a couple of messages that were very long and full of all the charges we could potentially expect, which made us feel unwelcome and almost like we had done something wrong before we even got there. So rather than contacting the host, we called air bnb, sent them photos of the mold and ended up getting a credit to find another place to stay. The process took all afternoon so we had to cancel our plans and basically lost a day of our trip trying to get it sorted out.\n\nTwo days later, I finally stopped coughing.\n\nI really hate to leave such a negative review, but mold is a serious issue which could lead to people getting sick. Unfortunately, I don't recommend staying here. The price is decent, but what does it matter if you end up spending your trip sick?"},{"_id":"201163819","date":{"$date":"2017-10-07T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12214471","reviewer_id":"117844587","reviewer_name":"Elly","comments":"Location and free parking are the advantages of this house.\n\nI saw the most cockroaches in my life and my husband actually caught ten. \n\nThe air conditioner is very noisy and the windows can not shut down the outside.\nThe sound of the concert, the sound of the construction, the sound of the car, and the street sounds perfect inside the room.\n\nFor three days, I felt very tired and uncomfortable.

Was a Super Good Deal for us!! \n\nThe room was good size for 3 of us, 2 adults and 1 kid. They got 1 bed for kid between the beds.\nThe host was super nice. The communication was always on time. Since we had a nice communication before we have stayed, we visited their office nearby the condo. They treated us like a family! \n\nWe did not need to stop by host's office to check in. Just go to the condo before the front gate closed around 8 pm since the keys were in the mailbox inside the front gate. And just dropped the keys inside the mailbox. Super easy check in and out.\n\nI saw some complain in the review, but I guess they all forget how much they paid for the place, i guess.\n\n\nFor the noise from the street from the past review, we thought nothing. I guess since the noisy pubs and clubs in front of this Marine Surf Condo were closed due to the renovation, the place gets more quiet than before. \n\nFor this price, they should thank the hosts and never complain about anything. It was one third of the normal Hawaii low class hotel rate. But the unit was much better than the hotel we stayed before. \n\nThey even include the parking space!\nI think this parking lot was the easiest parking space in Waikiki. \n\nOverall no complain at all. Truly we have stayed many hotel and condos so far, but this vacation rental offered by Lei Hawaii was way better than others. And please Do not trust any bad reviews. People complain even a small thing especially for those who forget how much they paid for this condo.  This is way cheaper than the hotel, so do not complain!! Will be best deal for you."},{"_id":"351415776","date":{"$date":"2018-11-22T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12214471","reviewer_id":"15966643","reviewer_name":"Simone","comments":"Great location.

When I checked in there was an issue with the apartment I booked - the host was quick to acknowledge her mistake and allow me to stay in another room in the building for the night.  As other reviewers have written - as this is an attic apartment, the floors in the bedrooms and bathroom are sloped, making it difficult to maneuver comfortably.  The bedrooms also get quite stuffy.

Thanks to a Turkish-speaking man who helped with translations at the airport, that this was the case. The cafe was difficult to spot late at night; for others who are arriving late, look for the Savoy Cake shop opposite the alleyway.\n\nMy six nights were comfortable though best for short folks like me. Unfortunately an earlier rainstorm seeped through the windows and both mattresses closest to the windows were wet. Good thing I was a single traveller and with a little rearrangement of the mattress in one of the bedrooms made the rest of the stay entirely satisfactory. There was a problem with the light in the bathroom on the first night but Zenka bounced in as soon as he got my message and got an electrician to fix it immediately. Less so with the sensor light that came on on day 3 and would not go off the rest of the stay. Admittedly it was during an important Muslim holiday.\n\nThe location was perfect, not far from Taksim and Tophane  for transport links. Lots of cafes and restaurants a short walk from the flat. Surprisingly quiet despite being in the middle of a lively area.\n\nThe building, though old, smelt lovely as did the flat. The towels and sheets were super clean. Air conditioner great for cooling the rooms down after a warm day under the eaves. The sloping ceilings can be a problem for some. Even I, at 1.63cm, managed to hit my head a few times.\n\nThe balcony was great though don't leave it or windows opened when out, as the roaming cats may decide to stray in.\n\nBe warned that there is very little in way of cutlery or plates but perhaps Zenka will take my suggestion of providing some.\n\nAll in all a very highly recommended place because I liked the area and in a building with character, very Parisian in feel, and very safe. Thank you Zenka."},{"_id":"195104061","date":{"$date":"2017-09-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12220612","reviewer_id":"4267447","reviewer_name":"Kelly","comments":"Clean room with two full beds and living space.

A mio avviso la casa è carina, va bene se non si hanno troppe pretese e se si è elastici per quanto riguardano le dimensioni. \nIl locale sottostante e che gestisce la casa è un buon punto di riferimento e possono fornire informazioni oltre che cibo."},{"_id":"237005479","date":{"$date":"2018-02-21T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12220612","reviewer_id":"173071705","reviewer_name":"Batuhan","comments":"TR: Fotoğraflarda görüleni tam olarak alıyorsunuz. Mekanla ilgili yanıltıcı bir durum yok. Yalnızca binanın gürültü çıkarmaya çok müsait olmadığını ve Cihangir'in yapısı gereği balkonda geçireceğiniz vaktin diğer dairelere ve pencerelere biraz yakın olacağını bilmeniz gerek. Ancak genel görgü kurallarına uyduğunuz sürece sorun olmayacaktır.  Yer tertemiz, sabun kokularıyla karşılanıyorsunuz. Wifi yeterli. Manzara makul. Fotoğraflar ve diğer yorumlardan dolayı, tavanın alçaklığı sizi endişelendirebilir. Biraz zorluk yarattığı doğru. Banyoda ve yatılan alanlarda biraz eğilmek gerekli olabiliyor ancak abartılacak bir şey değil. Büyük bir güvenle tercih edebileceğiniz bir yer. Son bir not: Mekanın yeri aslında adres olarak Sıraselviler caddesinde ancak küçük bir aralıkta kalıyor. Dolayısıyla size iletilen mekan adıyla yeri ararsanız daha kolay bulabilirsiniz.\n\nEN:You will get what you see. Nothing less than expected. You should know the building is old and that means loud noises will travel along thin walls and as a classical Cihangir street, the balcony is very close to other windows but as long as you keep your common sense about manners it shouldn't be a problem. Apartment is clean, welcomes you with soapy smells. Wifi is decent and view is reasonable. You may be concerned about height of the place because of the photographs and other comments. Partially that's true. You may need to do some bending in bathroom and sleeping areas but it's not at a deal breaker level. You can choose this place with trust.\nPS: Actual adress is on Sıraselviler St. yes, but it's situated in a narrow street. You may need to use place's name to find it on maps."},{"_id":"238574372","date":{"$date":"2018-02-26T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12220612","reviewer_id":"167127405","reviewer_name":"Muhammad Huzaifa Bin","comments":"Nice Place, very clean and tidy.

Ich selbst bin Erasmus-Student an der Istanbuler Universität. Sie waren aus Tiflis zu Besuch.\nWeil wir in meiner WG nicht genug Platz hatten, haben wir uns entschieden etwas über Airbnb zu suchen. So bin ich auf ,,Zenka Rooms“ aufmerksam geworden. \nUm uns einchecken zu können, mussten wir von einem Bistro den Schlüssel abholen. Die Frau, die auch unsere Ansprechspartnerin war, hat uns zu der Wohnung begleitet. \nDas Gebäude ist aus Holz und macht von außen einen sympathischen Eindruck. Auch beim Reingehen hatte ich sehr gutes Gefühl. Unsere Wohnung war im Dachgeschoss. Die Höhe des Daches im Wohnzimmer war c.a 1,80 cm. und in den ,,Zimmerchen“ 1,30 cm. Die Wohnung ist für die Kleinmenschen gedacht und nicht für die Menschen, die mehr als 1,30 groß sind. \nMeine Mutter und Tante, die beide Rückenschmerzen haben, mussten  die ganze Zeit krum rumlaufen. Beim ins Bett Gehen musste man sich schon direkt vor der Tür hinlegen und zur Matratze kriechen. \nDuschen war einfach Katastrophe. Das Bad war vielleicht gerade Mal c.a 3 Quadratmeter groß und 1,40 hoch. \nAls ich die Frau angesprochen habe, dass diese Wohnung nicht den Bildern entsprach, hat sie mir auf ihr Handy die Bilder gezeigt, die tatsächlich in der Wohnung gemacht wurden. Allerdings als ich gebucht habe, waren ganz andere Bilder drin, als die sie mir gezeigt hat. Sie haben mehrere Zimmer, die sie vermieten und auf der Seite sind die Bilder vermischt, sodass man die nicht zu einem Zimmer zuordnen kann. \nIch wäre nie auf die Idee gekommen, dass man sowas vermietet. \nEs möge für Pärchen vielleicht schön und romantisch sein, aber nicht für 50 jährigen Menschen, die unter Rückenschmerzen leiden. \nIch finde sowas muss extra groß geschrieben werden, dass die Wohnung 1,30 hoch ist!"},{"_id":"246271589","date":{"$date":"2018-03-25T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12220612","reviewer_id":"174977976","reviewer_name":"Francesca","comments":"L’appartamento è carino e siamo stati bene.

We are 183 and 182 cm tall, and there is only approximately 6sqm in the whole place where we can stand up straight. You have to sit down to shower and pee. The bedroom I was in was horribly claustrophobic, and my friends was smaller. It's not \"cosy\", or \"compact\" it's just completely unusable. The vast majority of the flat is 160cm high or much less. \n\nThis fundamental problem is mentioned nowhere in the listing.\n\nIf you are lucky enough to connect to the wifi, then you will discover that it is completely unusable. The hosts are aware of this, as previous reviews will show.\n\nThe listing states there is a half bath. There is not even a half shower.\n\nThe intro to the listing says you have a kitchen. You do not. There's just a sink in the living room, with an unfitted fridge handily placed to prevent you from reaching the sink, and to stub your toe in the process.\n\nThere is supposed to be a laptop friendly workspace. There is not. But then you won't need that because there's no wifi anyway.\n\nOn the first night we stayed here, I woke in the morning covered in bites. I did not see a single mosquito anywhere, so there's a good chance that I was bitten by bed bugs. \n\nThe \"curtains\" are bits of fabric shut into the windows, so if you open the windows, the \"curtains\" fall down.\n\nYou only get one set of keys with this property. At first this appears merely a little inconvenient, but when you realise that you can not leave the property without a key, in the unlikely event of a fire then this is not inconvenient, it's life threatening.\n\nIn short this listing is misleading, and the flat is an uncomfortable, impractical, insanitary death trap.

Спасло то, что за время нашего пребывание на улице потеплело, соответственно и в номере тоже. Одеяло одно на двухспальную кровать. Я не против, но кровать, это два матраца на плоду соединённых вместе, тут или нужно ещё сверху класть какой-то общий матрац или класть два одеяла, тк или я, или муж, спали в дырке. В первое утро не было воды от слова совсем, из-за этого пришлось сидеть в номере и ждать когда она пойдёт тк даже зубы было не почистить. Далее проблем с водой не было. Интернет ужасно работал, точнее он почти не работал. До поездки связалась с хозяином что бы уточнить этот вопрос, он заверял, что все проблемы улажены и в крайнем случае есть интернет в кафе рядом. В кафе рядом он тоже не работал. В целом об апартаментах...чисто, один раз убрались и сменили полотенца (мы были 4 ночи), все необходимое есть, в ванной надо бы шторку повесить, близко к центру и не шумно, рядом магазин.

The accommodation is basic with one main space with a television, small couch, and sink with a portable electric stove-top and kettle. There could be more pots and pans. Adjoining this room are two bedrooms each with two mattresses which, pushed together, make a double bed. The restaurant/ pub could be a little noisy on Friday and Saturday nights, but it didn't keep me up. It's clean and warm. They had cleaners come and tidy and replace the towels, which was lovely."}]}

The location was great, a five minute walk to the beach. Everything was organized and keys were ready when we arrived.  However the A/C was not satisfactory. The main unit was hard wired to a 4 hour timer presumably to save hydro. The loft would become very hot and difficult to sleep. The unit would shut off and you would end up walking up very hot and have to get up to turn on the unit again.  The system could not cope to keep the loft comfortable. After a day out the unit would be hot and take some time to cool down. If the ac was better I would not hesitate recommending this place. If you are not going to use the loft bedroom then it's adequate. If you are using it, you will have very warm nights."},{"_id":"107688557","date":{"$date":"2016-10-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12222943","reviewer_id":"27982060","reviewer_name":"Nuala","comments":"Great location and facilities"},{"_id":"125809540","date":{"$date":"2017-01-07T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12222943","reviewer_id":"67650818","reviewer_name":"Cory","comments":"The condo was exactly as we expected.

Há um shopping muito próximo também, estação de metrô e supermercado distante cerca de 1km (sempre caminhava até lá). Pode-se caminhar sem dificuldade até a praia Vermelha e o Pão de Açúcar.

As duas gatinhas já são idosas e basicamente dormem o dia inteiro, certamente não representam um ponto de tensão. Tinha minhas roupas lavadas e passadas impecavelmente, e sempre havia algum bolo ou quitute para desfrutar, inúmeras vezes comi pão de queijo fresquinho no café da manhã.\nIda é uma carioca da gema, muito receptiva, conversávamos muito, me emprestou casacos, mapas, jornal com programação cultural, me mostrou a cidade e após um mês de convivência, sentirei saudades. foi um período de muito aprendizado, descanso e diversão para mim."},{"_id":"204304036","date":{"$date":"2017-10-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12234922","reviewer_id":"125462525","reviewer_name":"Bruno","comments":"Lugar muito bonito, limpo, espaçoso e fácil acesso, perfeito para férias.

She was warm and welcoming in all communication, even texting us during our stay to see if we needed anything.\r\n   I gave her 3 stars for a couple reasons, some out of her control.  Her place is charming, but lacks air conditioning.  I'm from the Central Valley of CA \u0026 know heat, but the place is too hot to be in from 12-5pm, even with the drapes closed \u0026 the fans on high.  This meant we often could not eat lunch at the apartment \u0026 had to eat in town or take something in the morning when we left.\r\n  The upstairs neighbor also has a loud, aggressive, barking dog that we could hear most evenings.  The neighbor also chooses to brush her dog on the balcony, letting the dog hair fall onto Marilyn's patio below, even when we are sitting outside.\r\n  The final reason, most evenings we would return to the smell of pot from neighbors.  Some may not mind this, but it bothers me.  \r\n  I know most of these are not within Marilyn's control, but they did make our stay less than desirable. As mentioned, she was a pleasant host \u0026 quickly responded to any questions we had \u0026 made us feel welcome in her home.\r\n"},{"_id":"79400945","date":{"$date":"2016-06-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1223747","reviewer_id":"61023964","reviewer_name":"Lauren","comments":"We absolutely loved Marilyn's home! It was perfect and exactly what we were hoping for. The condo is super clean and Marilyn is wonderful at answering any questions or giving advice! She always got back to me very quickly. \nThe location was great. Everything that we wanted to do and had planned was super close to the condo. The beach across the street is great. Just steps from the condo and never over crowded. The little town just down the road has great restaurants and shops to grab some Souvenirs. We would definitely suggest checking out the Paia fish market for lunch/dinner. You can't go wrong grabbing breakfast at the Kihei Cafe. Make sure to get there early and bring cash!! That's all they accept. \nIf you head in the other direction towards Waliea-Makena you can go to Makena park. Big beach is located here. It's a beautiful beach. The waves get a little big though, so keep that in mind. \nMarilyn's condo had everything we needed. The view is beautiful. The complex is clean and very quiet. We never saw or heard another person the whole week we were there. It felt like we were the only couple in the complex. Our only concern at first was that there is no AC, but after one night, we quickly realized that it was not needed. Marilyn provides multiple fans and Maui gets very cool at night. With the fan and cool breeze, we slept great!! \nWe managed to get around most of the Island while we were in Maui. And honestly, we always found ourselves wanting to go right back to Kiehi! It's a\nVery relaxed and laid back community with not an overwhelming amount of touristy activity, which is exactly what we wanted. \nWe definitely will be back to Maui and would LOVE to stay at Marilyn's condo again!!!!

It is the perfect spot if you want a home-feel/based location.\n\nWe didn't get to meet the host, Marilyn, but she was in constant communication - and followed up quickly on questions.\n\nThe only downsides were:\n1. There is no AC. Coming from San Francisco and being used to the cold, the afternoons in the condo despite multiple fans were almost unbearable indoors. \n2. She had some last minute instructions that we were unprepared for (unlisted on her website) regarding guests/visitors.  She did, however, accommodate our request.\n3. If you love nuts, and nut products, this is not the place for you. We felt a little restricted in the food we could eat/cook at the condo.

It was kept cool by the 2 fans ( Marilyn also provided an AC to the bedroom, but we did not need to use it). Good beach chairs \u0026 towels were also provided . Marilyn reacted promptly to all  our messages , ( as an example , my wife asked if she could provide an hoover  to help us keep the condo clean during our stay , and next day there was one in the condo when we got back from the beach ).

She is kind, thoughtful, communicative, and understanding. \n\nA few weeks before we arrived, Marilyn sent us helpful information about checking into the condo as well as detailed suggestions for restaurants and places to visit.\n\nAlso, halfway through our stay, we found out that Hurricane Lane would be coming towards the islands. Marilyn called us immediately to talk us through the supplies we should pick up and preparations we should make . As the storm came through, we talked with her everyday. We appreciated all of her helpful check-ins and updates. She was really watching out for us! We also appreciated how understanding and patient she was when our flight home was cancelled because of the storm and we had to scramble to figure out new travel plans. Thankfully, the hurricane was kind to Kihei, and we didn't really feel its effects on that part of the island. \n\nIn regards to the actual condo itself:\n- As mentioned in the description, her place is a quick walk to the beach, which made evening sunset walks very convenient. The long stretch of beach near the apartment is beautiful. We visited the waters almost every day, and it was nice not having to drive.\n- The area that the condo is located is peaceful and relaxing. It was nice to come back to a quiet space after long days out adventuring.\n- We enjoyed eating breakfast on the outdoor lanai, which felt quite private and had a lovely view of palm trees and the water.\n- The condo is filled with beautiful paintings done by Marilyn herself!"},{"_id":"319575583","date":{"$date":"2018-09-06T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1223747","reviewer_id":"201654644","reviewer_name":"Juliana","comments":"If you are staying in Maui, and specifically Kihei, then I would absolutely recommend staying in Marylyn’s home.

The only small issue we had is that one of the bedrooms is without AC, and so if you're traveling to Istanbul during the summer it can get quite hot at night.

The neighbourhood is gentrified with a number of hip boutique shops, a bakery and cafes nearby with bus stops and a supermarket within walking distance. Paul and Judith were on holiday during my stay but I was well looked after by their daughters who popped in to help if needed. Even the nearby neighbour chipped in to help with getting inside when I arrived late at night and couldn't find the key. During my stay and chats with the eldest daughter and neighbour I could tell that this house had character and raised a nice and respected family. Be careful with the stairs though, they are a bit steep but I only carried a backpack with me. Lastly, the dogs Bonnie and Benny are very obedient, well-behaved and cute!

The bathroom was spacious and had some good amenities (laundry, extra toilet paper, hair dryer, shampoo and soap). Of note, there is only 1 towel per guest. There is also a kitchenette which has a tea kettle, silverware/plates, coffee, tea, sugar and fridge. The bed was comfy and apartment was clean.

We were a party of four and we truly felt welcomed and comfortable at Ayşe's place. We found it was very clean and everything was easily set for us. \nThe flat is very well located, just 1 min walk from Galata tower. The neighborhood is cool and has a variety of nice restaurants, cafes and shops to offer. The flat it self has a large living room, with very large sofas - perfect for lounging after a day of walking around. There were 3 well sized and comfortable bedrooms. The kitchen is well equipped and Ayşe was kind enough to leave us a huge supply of mineral water for our consumption, as you should not drink tap water in Istanbul. We found this extremely nice and considerate of her. Bathroom was perfect and shower works nice. \nWe stayed here in begging of October. The days were warm but the evenings were a bit cooler. Inside the flat we were not cold at any point. \nThe only downside is having to climb up four flights of stairs, but that's the reality of staying in a flat in the older neighborhoods of Istanbul: no lifts. We welcomed the exercise to burn out some of the calories put in by all the baklavas... \nAll and all a 5 stars experience.

I'm going to start with the cons since they really aren't bad at all; Be careful when using the small parking lot across the street next to the car rental place. One nite I put the parking ticket in the car but I either put it in upside down or the wind blew it upside down. The next morning the car was gone. It cost $160 to get a 25 car rental out of the tow place. Also the tow place and taxi ($40) only took cash. (bit of a racket). But on the plus side a very nice local Hawaiian paid for the taxi out of the kindness of his heart.The only con on the condo was the WiFi. I could not get it to reach the Condo. My wife had a college paper that she decided to postpone. We planned on this happening just to be safe so her professor was fine with it. Please dont let the parking and WiFi thing deter you. Its merely a heads up.  We would do it all again to be back in Hawaii and this amazingly priced location. The condo is bug free and has a lot of things one needs. Snorkels, mask, beach umbrellas. Not sure if others left these or if Paris provides them but they are nice. Also the clothes line on the balcony was very helpful too. We found a Frisbee in Hanama bay and added it to the collection.

Settling in was a breeze, particularly with the early checkin. The condo was very clean with good space for the two of us. It's location close to Kuhio Av was excellent with close access to the bus and the beach. David in reception was very helpful.\r\nWe were disappointed by a couple of aspects of the accommodation some of which are fixable. The condo is dark even in day, needing lights 24/7. There is no working light in dressing room and only a lamp in the bedroom, thus necessitating a flashlight to find things in luggage. The aircon is pretty noisy. I got a 2 inch splinter of wood from the floor flashing in my foot.  The puncture hole was quite significant. There are loose louvres in the bathroom and the aluminium bolt which locks the door to the lanai is very flimsy, so the unit is not particularly secure. It's a shame that the lanai has odd pieces of building materials on it. The double bed is very old and needs replacing and the sheets for the futon had holes. I think the condo needs some basic maintenance, some money spent to make it a reasonable renting proposition.\r\nThe things which are not fixable which I am sure Paris is aware of are the dumpster bins just below the lanai which become increasingly smelly as they fill, the view from the lanai itself into  the very close apartment walkways next door and the lanais below, which are unsightly. Sleep was interrupted by noise from other residents as this block is occupied by students and locals some who like to party. I guess this condo would be a little more loved if Paris lived here. Mahalo and aloha.\r\n"},{"_id":"24076740","date":{"$date":"2014-12-19T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1229106","reviewer_id":"5680321","reviewer_name":"Erick","comments":"Great location at Waikiki!

I really loved the vintage touch it has. Beds are both comfy and there is plenty of space. We only had Wifi in the pool area, which wasn't really a Problem. The condo is centrally located so everything is reachable by walk in and around waikiki. Bus stops right around the Corner are also a plus. The bar downstairs can turn very loud and weird on Weekends but it didn't really bother me. I would reccommend the Apartment for People who aren't looking for the quietest place and want to live centrally.

I loves how kitsch it was. Brilliant decor and lots of fun to stay in. Super close to a big supermarket and to town/the beach. We had three adults staying here and unless you're all going to bed/waking up at the same time, that's probably one too many. The sliding doors offer very little privacy. The sofa bed was comfy enough though. The balcony doors and blinds stayed closed. They look out onto the doors of other flats and over some dumpsters. So the smell wasn't great, with the heat. The Internet didn't reach the flat for any of us (and we had 6 devices between us). So we spent a lot of time on the landing when organising stuff online. \n\nA great little flat for a twosome, who aren't bothered about flash and bang, but want all the amenities covered and are willing to get Internet elsewhere "},{"_id":"57867930","date":{"$date":"2015-12-30T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1229106","reviewer_id":"26937008","reviewer_name":"Lucy","comments":"Our stay in Waikiki was incredible. The location couldn't be better in our eyes. The pics don't do the pool area justice, it's a great size and our 12 year old loves it. Everything you need is provided, we had 3 in the apartment with daughter on the fold out. The neighbors are friendly, and there is a cute little bar in the complex with interesting locals who love to tell a tale or two. It's loud at night, but when you're right amongst it, it's part of the experience. The unit is older but spotless, and full of charm.

When we first arrived, the keys were not in the lockbox, so we had to wait for the housekeeper to come back and drop them off to us. Two young girls met us at the lounge area, and handed us the keys. The communication with the owner was very prompt. She apologized for the keys not being where they should have been and kept calling/texting us regularly with updates. We appreciated her immediate response and caring replies. \r\nThere's no wifi in the unit but there is wifi downstairs by the pool area, and that was never an issue for us. \r\nThe location is superb! It's walking distance to Waikiki Beach, many attractions and tons of bus stops. Overall, it's really in a great location. The downside is that downstairs in the lobby area, there's a bar and it could get kind of rowdy and chaotic. We stayed there for a week, and three times we heard some really big fights, twice the police had to intervene but we did feel safe inside the unit. The area during the daytime is completely safe, it's just around midnight that things could get a little rowdy, not always though. \r\nThe owner, Paris, was very attentive to our needs via phone, because she is based in another state. When we first arrived, we had a cleaning issue because the place was not properly cleaned, and she did her best to accommodate us. The toilet had been used and had not been flushed (which made us wonder if it had been disinfected), there was fresh gum on a living room chair, the mirrors were not wiped down from the previous renter, there was a sticky spill that was not cleaned on the kitchen floor, bottles were left and used tissues were not thrown away. Overall, the place is dusty and needs a serious cleaning, but apart from that, we enjoyed our stay at Paris's apartment. We asked her permission to buy cleaning products so that we could clean and disinfect the place ourselves, and she agreed to reimburse us. However, we didn't ask for the reimbursement. The keynote is its location. We would just double check to make sure the place has been cleaned.

I like that it had a full kitchen because eating out can be quite expensive. The format of the place was convenient for more than one guest with the bathroom situated outside of the bedroom. The beach was a 10 minutes walk away. We went in February so the water was a little too cool for us, but many people were in the water while we were there. \n\nAs for transportation, the bus system was pretty easy to navigate and affordable. It takes twice as long than having your own car, but we weren't in too much of a hurry most of the time. We had rented a car as well and it was a bit of a hassle finding and paying for parking. There were plenty of parking space on the street and across the street in a paid parking lot, but they quickly filled up. Average parking rate was $2-4/hour. \n\nOverall, I think we got a great deal for the place and location.

Very cozy!  The place has been updated with all of the amenities you need.  Plus, all of the little touches make it a great say.  From the island magazines to help find good recommendations to the island map sitting out to help you find your way, Samantha put a lot of effort to make the stay very welcoming.  The place is on a small side street in north Kihei which is out little outside of the main town area, perfect for what we were looking for.  A short walk from the beach where you can see the sunset, but also very central on the island to get around.

The flat is basic,  but very homely, so ideal for our young family. Our children slept together in the living room, which was good fun at their age, but did make it all a little tight on space. This wasn't much of an issue for us though as we spent most of the time outside.

We were returning to HK after being away for 3 years, and this location was perfect for us.  The roof top provides a lovely view of Stanley Market and the bay, and in the opposite direction a view of The Twins, one of the finest hiking spots on HK Island.\nImmediately across the street is the main bus terminus for transport to other areas of HK Island; a mini bus stand adjacent to the terminus whisks to Chai Wan to connect with the MTR (HK's subway/Metro system); 3 minutes away is a grocery, and in the market itself, there are numerous shops and restaurants along the water front.\nIn short, this flat is ideally located.\nThe bed was very, very comfortable, and Stanley becomes very quiet after the shops close around 6 pm, so we rested very well.  We lacked for nothing inside the flat.\nI highly recommend this Airbnb!  Marcos communicated with us frequently and was available if needed through our week's stay.

We had 22 friends and family flying out for it, 16 of which needed a place to stay.  Since we were getting married at Kualoa Ranch, we wanted something close by.  I put 7 of my friends up in the Loft, and 9 of my friends in the rental house on the same property.\r\n\r\nSince my friends and I stayed at the Loft down the hill, I will be reviewing on part of my wife and her family.\r\n\r\nAll the feed back I received was the love of this home.  I was only in it twice during stay, once for a Thanksgiving dinner the night before the wedding, which will forever be a Thanksgiving dinner I will never forget, both for it's ability to accommodate the family, and the beautiful home it is.  It was beautiful, very clean, and decorated in a way you felt at home.  The deck was great, and the jungle back drop provided awesome sounds to wake up relaxed to.\r\n\r\nAbby was great, very helpful through the booking process and getting us checked in.

On the way to the location I agree with everyone that it seems a bit sketchy with the junk cars on the side of the road. The place is a bit hard to find during the day I couldn't even imagine in the night time, I would highly recommend checking in during day light as there is no lights on this unpaved road. Once inside the ranch is where the magic happens, you see the horses, cows, goats, donkeys, ducks, roosters... This place is lovely in the sense that you feel you are in the middle of nowhere and that's a good thing. The house itself is roomy and has been upgraded. The only real downside is you can't really have anybody over and you can't be too loud... What I mean by too loud is, we got a noise complaint when 4 of us were talking on the balcony past 10pm...

The ranch is conveniently located close to the beach and near all the North Shore has to offer.  It is easy to get to and yet is not in a noisy, congested area. It was really a home away from home. \n\nDave and Joyce were very welcoming and responsive.  They invited us to feel at home at the ranch and invited us to their home for a social gathering one night.  They gave us local pointers about the island and told us about a private waterfall on the ranch that we were able to find on one of our many walks.  \n\nThe house is well appointed and the materials are high end.  We rented the entire house and it worked out perfectly for our big family.  My kids loved the large tub with TV in the master bathroom. Rental of the entire house includes two separate kitchens and living rooms.  \n\nWhen you first drive in the main road that you take to the Ranch has a number of abandoned vehicles  - which is quite common for Hawaii.  Apparently, people abandon cars because it is too expensive to get rid of them through legal means on the island. This is an ongoing issue and the owners are working on ways to eradicate this continuing problem. \n\nI would definitely recommend the Ranch."},{"_id":"245109704","date":{"$date":"2018-03-20T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12310597","reviewer_id":"165683581","reviewer_name":"Amber","comments":"Tradwinds ranch is a lovely place in a very scenic, rural area with the mountains in the back ground and the beach is 10- 15 min walk away.

The house was very clean, well maintained, and comfortable.  All beds were comfortable, and the layout was perfect for our family.  Joyce shared some farm fresh eggs with us, which we enjoyed very much.  We truly have nothing negative to say.  For those who have not been to Oahu, they should know that the ranch is in the \"country\" of Oahu, so it is a bit longer drive to some of the tourist attractions on the south of the island, but it offers easy access to the North Shore, and there are many beaches, the Polynesian Cultural Center, and other attractions very close.

Before I started with the inside of the apartment, like any property the most important is location, location and location. Evan \u0026 Maria's apartment is located at the heart of Manhattan. It is a walking distance to the Rockefeller Plaza and also to Times Square. There are several restaurants near the apartment and a deli just around the corner to get anything you wanted. \n\nOkay, now we begin with the apartment. It is very beautiful. Not only you can get anything you wanted but also you can tell the owner put a lot of their heart in to it. It is beautifully decorated and also very clean. \n\nOn a personal note, we have the booking wrong, so we have to checked out a day earlier than we intended to. Evan and Maria were very nice and courteous about it. He texted us to let us know that we have to check out and patiently await our arrival, since we're on a ferry to Liberty Island, and help us find a hotel to move.\n\nAll and all it was a great experience even with the moving around and one thing for sure, if I ever in NY I will most definitely try to book Even and Maria super homey apartment.\n\nThank you Evan \u0026 Maria and good luck with the baby ...\n\nyours truly,\n\nThe De Haans"},{"_id":"101253620","date":{"$date":"2016-09-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12317903","reviewer_id":"19127597","reviewer_name":"Katherine","comments":"Evan and Maria were accommodating with my check in and check out.

The apartment is just as it appears in the photos: impeccably clean, modern, updated and cozy.  The bed and pillows were incredibly comfortable and provided a restful nights sleep after long days exploring the city.  Our adult daughter slept on the futon, and she was in heaven!  There were extra pillows, sheets and a comforter in the closet, and I'm not exaggerating when I say that she was more comfortable here than in the hotel room we stayed at during our first half of our trip.  The apartment had everything we needed: dishes, Keurig coffee and coffee maker (my #1 priority!), iron, hair dryer and much, much more!  There was a fantastic bottle of Pinot Noir that I thoroughly enjoyed and a jar full of Hershey's kisses (which we ate entirely too many of)!  Evan and Maria thought of everything; there is even an iPhone charger to use!  For NYC, it was very quiet and peaceful, which came as a pleasant and unexpected surprise to us.  The location can't be beat, close to great restaurants, parks,  \u0026 subways.  I'm sure I'm forgetting something, but let me end by saying that this apartment is so great that I want to live in it!  In fact, our daughter hopes to relocate to the city soon, and she took note of just how well Evan and Maria utilized the space and all the most wonderful details.  Well done.

Check in and check out was flawless with good communication over text and email. We had a late flight and the hosts were above and beyond accommodating with letting us store our luggage downstairs so we didn't have to lug them around during or last day. The neighborhood is very nice and pleasantly quiet, which is a rare find in the city. We got around fine the whole week with our subway card and walking.

It was very convenient to mid town activities including Rockefeller Center, Times Square, and Central Park (south).  There were so many restaurants in the neighborhood that you cannot try them all.  Evan had lots of good suggestions to help us choose.    We liked the pizza place on the corner, the Ideal Cheese Shop and the local grocery store.  The Citibikes also worked well on dedicated bike lanes going north and south along 1st and 2nd ave right by the apartment, along the Hudson and the East River,  and in Central Park.   There is a bike shop across the street if you need a helmet.  \n\nThe studio apartment is very well maintained.    It looked just like the pictures.

Charming, comfortable, quiet.  Great location, near subways and buses.  We also walked back and forth from east side to Theater District several times with no problem.  If you’re looking to prepare meals from scratch, the kitchen is really not stocked with enough cookware.  But there’s a big microwave and plenty of dishware for simple meals or heating up meals you bring in.  Bed was comfortable for the 4 nights we were there.  AC and fan kept us cool.  Warning...if you’re large or tall, you might find the bathroom toilet and sink space tight, but the shower is really big and nice.   We managed to get suitcases up the 2 short flights of stairs and going down and up without them was not a problem.  Lobby is a bit dark and not particularly clean, but Evan \u0026 Maria’s studio is a little oasis and very tastefully furnished.  Nice big TV.   They responded very quickly to any questions we had.

I’ve just got back to the UK. \nLocation. 10/10. Less than 10 minute walk to subway. A choice of 2 stations and one is the E line that takes to to/from JFK. \nQuiet block considering that it is a central location. We walked to Grand Central in about 20 minutes. \nCleanliness. I’ll mark it down by half a point due to lipstick marked glasses nd dirty coffee cups. No big deal, but others might find it rather unpleasant. Other than that it was IMMACULATE. \nThe bed is super comfy. Better than my bed at home that has a £2000 memory foam mattress on it ! Superb. \nCheck in. A slight issue when Maria thought we were 2 days early but all was good in the end. Didn’t meet Evan or Maria. Collected the keys from the doorman at their apartment block next door. He was a bit stern but no problem. He allowed us to store our cases in a small storeroom. \nGood shower. Point of note. This is a studio apartment. The bed is in the lounge. You also have a sofa and a small table with chairs and a coffee table. \nSmall kitchenette but we only used the coffee maker and put some milk in fridge. You couldn’t really make a meal there as it’s quite small but who goes to New York to cook ??!!??\nThere are about 18 steps from the street to the apartment front door so if you’re elderly or have bid heavy suitcases you might struggle. \nWe had a great time in New York.

Initially we used uber to get around but then once we figured out the streets we chose to get the subway or walk it was alot easier tjan a taxi, cheaper and with a good location, everything was easy to get to! Whilst we didnt need Evan and Maria during our stay we always knew they would be on hand to help us if needed, check in and out was quick and easy and they were only a phonecall or message away! If returning to New York again we would definately choose to stay in this apartment and recommend to friends! Some personal recommendations we had would be; 230 fifth avenue roof top bar, ellens stardust diner for breakfast, the comedy cellar for a stand up show and emilys close by to the venue for the best burger I've ever had, red rooster for a gospel brunch, chelsea market, the rockettes christmas show, brooklyn bridge and then eating at Grimaldis the other side and then the black tap for the most indulgent milkshake I've ever had!"},{"_id":"217306694","date":{"$date":"2017-12-08T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12317903","reviewer_id":"113575754","reviewer_name":"Sandra","comments":"Dear Evan and Maria,\nwe had a great stay in your flat in New York City.

Once contacting Evan and Maria they explained how to turn the old style heater on. It was easy to follow the instructions however we did find that the heater was quite loud and sounded like a steam machine. If we had the heater on at the same time as the tv it was quite hard to hear what was happening on the tv. Other than the noise of this heater, it did work quickly to heat up the studio apartment. \n\nOverall we had a great time visiting New York and would stay here again, preferably in summer as we are not used to this kind of cold weather in Australia! \n\nThanks for having us :)"},{"_id":"226594958","date":{"$date":"2018-01-11T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12317903","reviewer_id":"111424703","reviewer_name":"Mariana","comments":"The studio was comfortable and well located.

The neighborhood felt safe and was a short walking distance (a block!) to a 24-hour grocery store, a coffee shop, and great restaurants. Check-in was really easy and Evan and Maria were in touch the entire time to make sure the process went smoothly. The apartment is only two flights up and was sparkling clean when I arrived. The apartment exceeded my expectations- the space was nicely decorated, the bed felt new and was extremely comfortable, the kitchen was well-equipped, the shower had great pressure and hot water, and the building/surrounding area was peaceful and quiet after dark. It was a great place to come home to after my conference meetings and visiting the city. I can't think of a single drawback except that the apartment doesn't get a lot of natural light and the space around the toilet would be tight for someone six feet tall (but these things didn't affect me at all).  I've stayed in NYC a few times now and this was one of the most easiest and relaxing experiences thanks to this great airbnb.

The location is ideal, east 49th street, only a short walk to the Rockefeller and Times Square and subway nearby means nothing feels inaccessible from your room.

There were things like extra towels, napkins, an ironing board, a bag of ice in the freezer and so many more that you wouldn't typically be provided but were so handy to have. As I was travelling with a friend, we made use of the sofa bed as well. This was very comfortable (although a little squeaky!) and allowed us our own space within the apartment over our 2 week stay.

The room and amenities are very clean, with extra towels and sheets in the cupboard, should you need them. I was worried about heating since it's winter and the listing didn't have heating ticked, but they provided a thermostat heater that kept us nice and cosy. Another cute thing to note was the deco.

You can't help but feel relaxed watching the ocean and wandering along the walking track. There's also loads of good places to eat! You're only a 15 minute walk to Manly Wharf, then half hour straight into Circular Quay on the ferry. The commuters obviously take it for granted, but it's such an amazing ferry ride!

The upstairs loft is very pleasant and well furnished, but completely open to the downstairs area with no way to block sound or light (we knew this going in but didn’t realize how taxing that would be). The patio was great and we enjoyed being central on the island and the lot always had parking.

We were also disappointed that there wasn’t better seating for a place that hosts up to 4 guests. There wasn’t anywhere for all 4 of us to sit together and eat or play a card game comfortably. We loved the pool and the hot tub - it was never too crowded and just steps from the unit (we were here during a peak time - New Years).

The safe was not operable when we arrived but after a few days it was fixed.  The listing pictures are exactly as they appear.  The apt. was very clean and updated.  Very comfortable!  The neighborhood was nice, with a grocery store very near and a coffee shop in front.  We felt safe there although my husband was pickpocketed close by in his front pocket first day we were there.  My advice is to stay away from smaller roads in this area. I know this can happen anywhere, we travel a lot and are very vigilant in keeping our belongings safe.  We were lucky this time, they only took his cell phone.   I would stay in this apartment again when I return to Barcelona.

The apartment is as advertised in the pictures. It's clean, well-maintained, and quite spacious. The beds are comfortable, the bathrooms are in great condition, and the AC seems to work well. However, it wasn't too hot during our stay so I'm not sure how it is during the summer months. One thing to keep in mind is the apartment is on the 5th floor and the elevator can hold 2-3 people. My group only had backpacks so it wasn't a big deal for us but if you have a lot of luggage, it could be annoying.\n\nThe location is great. It's very close to a lot of late night bars and tapas restaurants. Public transportation is close by and it's easily within waking distance to La Rambla, the Gothic Quarter, and even Barceloneta.\n\nEnrique was an excellent host. He reached out to us well before our stay to make sure check-in would be smooth and easy.

Non siamo rimasti delusi dall'appartamento, molto carino e bene arredato e  in un'ottima posizione  per raggiungere il centro storico sia a piedi sia con la metro; inoltre la presenza di doppi servizi si è rivelata estremamente utile. Tuttavia il nostro soggiorno ha preso una brutta piega quando la notte del 31 dicembre per un problema tecnico all'intero stabile è andata via la corrente, lasciandoci per due giorni senza luce in casa. Naturalmente il problema e la sua risoluzione non sono dipesi dallo staff di Stay-unique, tuttavia non siamo rimasti soddisfatti di come tutta la questione è stata affrontata. \nInnanzitutto al nostro arrivo siamo stati accolti da un ragazzo italiano, Andrea, che ci ha assicurato che avremmo potuto contattarlo in qualsiasi momento per qualsiasi problema, ma (non a caso) non ci ha lasciato il suo numero dicendoci che avremmo potuto contattarlo chiamando il numero per i clienti di Stay unique. Peccato che la sera del 31, quando si è verificato il problema, non è stato possibile parlare con lui perché ci è stato detto che non lavorava quella sera. Ad ogni modo abbiamo parlato con una ragazza molto gentile che ci ha proposto di mandare un tecnico la sera stessa (stiamo parlando del 31 dicembre alle 23.00), ma noi data la serata particolare, in cui dubitavamo che sarebbe arrivato realmente qualcuno, abbiamo chiesto di mandare il tecnico la mattina successiva. Il primo gennaio ci siamo svegliati prima del previsto per aspettare il tecnico e siamo rimasti a casa tutta la mattina ( sottraendo tempo alla visita della città) per poi sentirci dire che il problema dipendeva dalla società elettrica che gestiva il condominio e che quindi bisognava aspettare che fosse la società e riparare il guasto. Dato che la sera dell'1 gennaio il problema persisteva, ci hanno offerto un altro appartamento per passare la notte nel quale ci siamo trasferiti all'una di notte, pagando un taxi, perché quella sera avevamo un concerto prenotato al Palau della Musica. Da notare che l'appartamento datoci in alternativa non aveva le stesse caratteristiche di quello che avevamo prenotato (niente doppi servizi e secondo letto da una piazza e mezza, quindi neanche matrimoniale e per di più in uno spazio comune). La mattina successiva abbiamo chiesto di poter restare nel nuovo appartamento anche per l'ultima notte (il giorno successivo saremmo ripartiti) ma ci hanno detto che non era possibile, quindi siamo tornati nuovamente nell'altra casa, dove il problema si è risolto verso le due del pomeriggio. Nel frattempo abbiamo dovuto pulire tutto il frigo che si era sbrinato e buttare la spesa al suo interno perché andata a male).\nCome risarcimento per la vacanza rovinata, i disagi e il tempo perso Stay unique ci ha proposto un risarcimento del 20% sul totale del soggiorno. Quando abbiamo fatto notare che non era adeguato al danno subito facendo notare anche la spesa che abbiamo dovuto buttare, ci hanno proposto solo un risarcimento del costo della spesa e del taxi per lo spostamento nell'altro appartamento e anzi, hanno pure avuto il coraggio di dire che noi abbiamo rifiutato alcune soluzioni che ci avevamo proposto, cioè mandare un tecnico il 31 dicembre alle 23 (che, come no, sarebbe di sicuro venuto!) o trasferirci le valigie nel nuovo appartamento (non sarebbe servito a niente dato che avremmo comunque dovuto lasciarlo la mattina successiva); inoltre hanno pure avuto la faccia tosta di dire che il frigo era in ordine (ci credo, abbiamo passato noi la mattina a pulirlo!). A conclusione di tutto questo, non hanno nemmeno aspettato che accettassimo la loro proposta e hanno provveduto a fare il bonifico del rimborso, per mettersi le spalle al coperto.  Non è questo il modo di fare.\nCapisco che questo problema non sia dipeso da loro, ma non ci è piaciuto il modo in cui siamo stati trattati, siamo stati presi in giro."},{"_id":"400232107","date":{"$date":"2019-01-11T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12378302","reviewer_id":"28868507","reviewer_name":"Soheil","comments":"Nice and clean place.

The one thing that I would complain about, of which the host has no control over, is that the wall between the back bedroom and the adjacent apartment seems to be pretty thin and when we were the neighbors liked to stay up late and talk.

We could not have chosen a better place to stay during our visit.

Inside, the room is exactly as pictured with a lovely view of the street below, private bathroom and shower with wonderful water pressure, and comfortable/clean bed and linens. Everything was very clean and tidy, and the building itself of organized and functional (has a fully equipped shared kitchen and cute living room for guests). Thanks for Fred’s pre-arrival messages, the check in/out process was super easy.\n\nHelpful hints: The building is about a 5 min walk from the train station (perfect for those like us who came from Lisbon for a few days in Porto) and metro stations are also a very short walk away; the area is really safe and we never felt strange or scared at any time of the day/night; there is no elevator in the building so luggage will have to be carried up a few flights of stairs, but it’s a very easy staircase with landings around every curve; for a great place to eat modern and delicious Portuguese food at reasonable prices, enjoy a meal at nearby Brasao Cervejaria Aliados!\n\nWe cannot recommend this flat enough and we hope all who stay with Fred will enjoy their stay as much as we did :)"},{"_id":"228810767","date":{"$date":"2018-01-21T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12400621","reviewer_id":"37499724","reviewer_name":"Celia","comments":"Ubicación perfecta, casa tal cual se ve en las fotos, habitación muy cómoda, súper limpia, acogedora, ducha increíble.

I’m a 69 year old female and relatively fit but I found the stairs aren’t to code that we’re used to so just be aware if you’re in that retirement age category. The noise from the street outside on the weekend was pretty loud even with ear plugs but Sunday night it quieted down. I’d still say that anything that could be considered a negative is far outweighed by the positives of this place."},{"_id":"321880926","date":{"$date":"2018-09-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12400621","reviewer_id":"174570274","reviewer_name":"Martyna","comments":"Polecam.

Maria was there everyday to clean the place specially the comun areas. The room was very clean, maybe a little small but it had  space for the luggage. The room was super light as well so that was very nice. On the second day we ask Fred for some extra covers since it was a bit cold and he brought one for that night, so even though we never met him cause the place is more like a guess house, he doesn't actually live there, he was always aware of what was happening. Overall it was a really good experience, like a said is more like a guess house not the whole local host experience, but I was ok with it, if you are looking for some privacy then this is a really good choice. I'm not sure wether there were bathrooms in the other dormitories because there is only one toilet and two showers in the house, (thats what I saw) we were there for december so there was hardly any other guesses but I'm not sure how it would work in the summer, with the house full of people, so you might want to check that out. But well at the end we had a really good stay, Maria is really nice and finally make sure to follow Freds advices about the places to go.

Depending on which room you get, you may have to walk up a few flights of stairs which is normal in these areas... totally worth it!"},{"_id":"188742133","date":{"$date":"2017-08-30T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12401124","reviewer_id":"17417131","reviewer_name":"Kristina","comments":"Guesthouse in super zentrale Lage!

It is a Guesthouse with 5 rooms, some with private bathrooms and some that share a communal bathroom. We were in the Bombarda room on the top floor. It's a very light space and the design is great. The view is amazing. There are two showers in the bathroom. Unfortunately the showerheads were very loose, so when the water was turned in fully the pressure was a little to much and the water sprayed everywhere. We tried to apologize to Maria the cleaning lady for the extra work, but unfortunately her englich wasn't too great. Maybr that could be fixed so it doesn't happen to other guests in the future. \nOther than that,  everything was great and we had absolutely nothing to complain about."},{"_id":"192377204","date":{"$date":"2017-09-10T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12401124","reviewer_id":"46944521","reviewer_name":"Maria","comments":"The stay was perfect, great location, clean and very comfortable. \nFrancisco received me and explained everything we needed.

When it rains, I felt a little bit cold, but there was a heater that I can use. It was very useful. I haven't met Fred during my stay, but he was nice. The location was perfect. It was center of the city.\n\nThe Fred's house is a whole building that seems like hostel style. There are 5 different rooms, 1 shared bathroom (1 toilet, 2 shower booths), a kitchen and a living room in the building. The Bombarda room is located the last floor, no lift, so if you have a big luggage it can be problem. But because I have only small luggage, it was fine. The bathroom is downstair of Bombarda.\n\nEverything was very clean because the cleaning lady makes it everyday. She is also very nice. \n\nThe best part of this room was the windows. I could see the city every morning through the window, and it made me very happy."},{"_id":"405083076","date":{"$date":"2019-01-26T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"12401124","reviewer_id":"24567113","reviewer_name":"Chris","comments":"Fred's place is perfect for your stay in Porto.

It was the right price and a fine location, but a bit impersonal. Access to the key only works with small hands, so I had to flag down a random woman to help me get in. Once inside it was clean and bright with all the necessities. There were others staying that I heard but never saw. Great for a group when you might take multiple rooms and make it your own.

Kihei market was merely a 2 minute walk away as was the surf school where you can rent out paddle boards or surf boards and other gear. Since it is centrally located, driving to other places in Maui was also convenient. \n\nHospitality was outstanding - we knew where we wanted to go but the apt had a Maui guide book on the coffee table for quick reference. There were great amenities to play Music, a nice bookshelf with various reads if you just want to read by the beach and chairs to take to the beach  to relax in between your snorkeling/swimming excursions. \n\nThe views - oh my god. The photos do not do it justice. We had sweeping views of the pacific and saw early morning paddle-boarders, surfers and sea turtles right from the balcony! Im sure if you come during the winter months, you can watch whales literally while drinking your morning coffee. No need to go to an expensive touristy bar to get that perfect Hawaiian sunset :) \n\nI don't know what else to say. Highly recommend for a great time."}]}
