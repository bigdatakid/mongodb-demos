We are located very close to 7th Avenue, which has all kinds of shopping. There are fine groceries such as Union Market, several good delis, some of the best bagels in New York at the Bagel Hole,etc., as well as restaurants with food from every corner of the globe, ranging from higher end fare at places like Talde to our local diner located right on the corner of the block.  Many fine coffee shops, bars and stores of every description are also only a short walk away, as is Prospect Park (located two blocks away) with its many wide open spaces and forest paths, where you can forget for a while that you are in a big city.","notes":"Please, no smoking, no pets, and no parties, and please use the recycling bins.","transit":"SUBWAY We are located three short blocks from the 7th Avenue subway station on the F and G lines. The F train is the easiest way to get to Manhattan, about 20 minutes from Greenwich Village, and there are easy transfer points along the F line that will get you anywhere you need to go in Manhattan. The G train does not go into Manhattan but offers easy access to Brooklyn’s Williamsburg neighborhood and locations in Queens.  BUSES The 67 and 69 buses run along 7th avenue, and the 61 bus that runs along 9th street is also very close.  TAXI There are often green or yellow NYC taxis around. The green taxis work the same as the yellow but are designated specifically to stop in Brooklyn and boroughs other than Manhattan. There are many car services in the neighborhood as well (we’ve had pretty good luck with Eastern). PARKING There is free parking on the numbered streets and metered parking on 7th Avenue. Read signs carefully for street cleaning rules.  CAR RENTAL There are many Zipcar locati","access":"The apartment is located on the ground floor of our townhouse. There is a separate outdoor entrance that opens from the bottom of the stoop on the left. Once inside, there is another key which opens the door to the apartment, located immediately on your left. We infrequently use this hallway for basement access. We will either be available to hand you the keys ourselves or make other arrangements if you arrive when we are not able to be there.","interaction":"We are a family of three living upstairs (with a cat who is not allowed into the rental apartment), so while we are of course busy with our daily routine, please don’t hesitate to contact us by phone, text, or e-mail if there are any problems, items missing, or other questions. If by chance you are staying while we are out of town, we will give you the contact information of someone who can help.","house_rules":"","property_type":"Guest suite","room_type":"Entire home/apt","bed_type":"Real Bed","minimum_nights":"3","maximum_nights":"1125","cancellation_policy":"moderate","last_scraped":{"$date":"2019-03-07T05:00:00.000Z"},"calendar_last_scraped":{"$date":"2019-03-07T05:00:00.000Z"},"first_review":{"$date":"2016-01-22T05:00:00.000Z"},"last_review":{"$date":"2019-02-04T05:00:00.000Z"},"accommodates":3,"bedrooms":0,"beds":0,"number_of_reviews":115,"bathrooms":{"$numberDecimal":"1.0"},"amenities":["TV","Cable TV","Wifi","Air conditioning","Kitchen","Paid parking off premises","Free street parking","Heating","Family/kid friendly","Smoke detector","Carbon monoxide detector","First aid kit","Safety card","Fire extinguisher","Essentials","Shampoo","Hangers","Hair dryer","Iron","Laptop friendly workspace","Self check-in","Lockbox","Hot water","Microwave","Coffee maker","Refrigerator","Dishwasher","Dishes and silverware","Cooking basics","Oven","Stove","Single level home","Garden or backyard","Luggage dropoff allowed","Long term stays allowed"],"price":{"$numberDecimal":"135.00"},"security_deposit":{"$numberDecimal":"200.00"},"cleaning_fee":{"$numberDecimal":"50.00"},"extra_people":{"$numberDecimal":"25.00"},"guests_included":{"$numberDecimal":"2"},"images":{"thumbnail_url":"","medium_url":"","picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/abce9916-b9fb-44ad-8cfd-84c1b965941a.jpg?aki_policy=large","xl_picture_url":""},"host":{"host_id":"54539364","host_url":"https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/54539364","host_name":"Ildiko","host_location":"New York, New York, United States","host_about":"","host_response_time":"within a day","host_thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/e25c220f-afd4-4df0-9c8a-663c2ab695ab.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","host_picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/e25c220f-afd4-4df0-9c8a-663c2ab695ab.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","host_neighbourhood":"Park Slope","host_response_rate":93,"host_is_superhost":true,"host_has_profile_pic":true,"host_identity_verified":false,"host_listings_count":1,"host_total_listings_count":1,"host_verifications":["email","phone","reviews","offline_government_id","selfie","government_id","identity_manual"]},"address":{"street":"Brooklyn, NY, United States","suburb":"Brooklyn","government_area":"South Slope","market":"New York","country":"United States","country_code":"US","location":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.98307,40.6651],"is_location_exact":true}},"availability":{"availability_30":6,"availability_60":10,"availability_90":12,"availability_365":204},"review_scores":{"review_scores_accuracy":10,"review_scores_cleanliness":10,"review_scores_checkin":10,"review_scores_communication":10,"review_scores_location":10,"review_scores_value":10,"review_scores_rating":98},"reviews":[{"_id":"60372814","date":{"$date":"2016-01-22T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10573225","reviewer_id":"53311607","reviewer_name":"Evan","comments":"Ildiko and her space were nothing short of great.\r\n\r\nI had rented out the space under unusual circumstances, likely out of the ordinary compared to most Airbnb reservations.

The apartment is quite a bit larger than the photos made it seem, and I was very comfortable here. It's also on the first floor, which is nice if you have heavy suitcases (it gets difficult lugging stuff up three flights of stairs). Even though it's on street level, the street is a quiet / residential one, and the entrance is some distance from the sidewalk—so noise is not an issue. There are very nice restaurants and cafes less than a block or two away. Ildiko went the extra mile in stocking the apartment with essential items, including a fully stocked first-aid kit(!). Although I had office space in Manhattan, I spent all of my time working from home, because I didn't want to leave the house or this neighborhood. Prospect Park is also very close, which makes for a nice place to go for a walk and clear the mind. Definitely one of the nicest and most pleasant airbnb experiences I've had so far!"},{"_id":"67671286","date":{"$date":"2016-03-30T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10573225","reviewer_id":"28683820","reviewer_name":"James","comments":"This was a spacious, clean apartment in a great neighborhood.

Ildiko is accomodating and quite cool for making me to feel at home.\n\nThe apartment is too bright, calm and very clean. It is comfortable and has enough space that can fit up to 4 people. The heater worked more than expected during the coolest days.\nThe kitchen connected with the dining room is a plus, cooking was really a pleasure. Unfortunately, we could not enjoy the backyard which looks very pleasant in warmer weather.\n\nTons of restaurants, grocery stores and all kinds of shops are within walking distance, subway stations and bus lines as well. Prospect park is less than 10 min away.\n\nAll in all, staying at Ildiko's apartment was a great experience. I definitely plan to stay here again especially in summer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"_id":"138625404","date":{"$date":"2017-03-20T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10573225","reviewer_id":"105509253","reviewer_name":"Gregory","comments":"Ildiko is a great host and the place is as advertised.

The apartment has a great collection of books and CDs, which we highly appreciated, plus a nice outside space. The only thing we would have liked is more than just one towel each for a 9-night stay, particular given the lack of a washing machine/dryer.

It's queen size and there is a futon if you have a kid or friend along.

Numerous shops, delis, restaurants, coffee shops, and groceries within a short walk.

When it's hot at night down in Waikiki, on top of Maunalani Heights we sleep with a light summer blanket and no air conditioning!!

A check-in video will be sent to your personal email shortly before your arrival. A KEURIG coffee (K-CUP) machine and coffee capsules (PODS) are provided.

Assisted check-in (with a person) is available upon request and for an additional fee; it is available for special situations, \"just in case\"! It is rarely used by our guests. Our guests find the video and the self-check-in email very helpful and sufficient.  A special message for our international guests: to coordinate the check in, we set up a group text message that includes local manager Jhanna; this is needed because Jhanna does not have access to Airbnb.

No visitors are allowed on the premises at any time; No smoking, pets, loud music please!!  The hallway door, which affords privacy to your patio, needs to be kept closed at all times; if left open, the wind will slam the door shut and create noise and possible damage to the door.

His home is on a mountain, as described, so the streets getting to and from the studio were steep (at least steeper than I expected). For the most part everything was nice and clean. Basic kitchen supplies and tools were available (knives, forks, cutting board, pots, pans, salt, pepper, oil, etc) and 3 beach towels and 4 bath towels were available for use. The patio was also really nice and wished we could have used it more (but of course, we were out and about doing other things). Keep in mind that the homes here ARE in close proximity to each other, so you may be able to hear other people and their conversations.  We had a really comfortable stay and loved it! Thanks Andrei!

We were greeted by Mariya upon arrival, and she was great. She walked us in, showed us how to work a few things and gave us the keys.  \r\n\r\nThe studio is beautiful. Perfect for two people. The shower at the end of everyday was amazing. We loved the finishes throughout the space- beautiful wood cabinetry, the countertops, appliances, and the bathroom was perfect. The bed was very comfortable- just bring extra pillows if you sleep with more than one per person. \r\n\r\nThe outdoor living space provided absolutely stunning views over the ocean and diamond head. There was comfortable furniture, space to hang drying towels and even a sink outside. The flowering trees next to the porch were also lovely. \r\n\r\nThe kitchen was very useful. When we arrived, Mariya mentioned that there might be roaches (they do spray the apartment regularly, and there was spray under the sink). The presence of these bugs is not due to a lack of cleanliness- just a consequence of location on a tropical island. We had 6 unwelcome guests during the 8 days, but we were able to get rid of them quickly. This is not a criticism of the apartment or cleaning- but just something to be mindful of anywhere on Oahu. \r\n\r\nI would absolutely stay here again if I returned to the island, and highly recommend this studio. If you have a rental car, there is nowhere on the island you would visit that would take much longer than an hour. We were able to go all over the island without any trouble, and had an amazing time. \r\n\r\nMany thanks to Andrei and Mariya for their help and for the opportunity.

The studio's lanai is super-nice and on clear days, the view towards Diamond Head is priceless! Overall, the studio was clean, is tastefully furnished and although not big, it is still a good fit for a couple.\nUnfortunately, there was also some construction going on in the adjacent appartment, but we were able to clarify this with Andrei. \n\nTwo more things just to be aware of: \n1. The windows are hawaiian-style (as you can see in the pictures), which means you can have a nice breeze (a plus!), but also do not provide a lot of noise isolation if it gets windy outside. It is a quiet neighborhood however. You can also not darken the room a lot, if it matters to you.\n2. For all you coffee-lovers out there, there is no coffee maker available. Instant coffee is provided though.\n\nOverall, we can recommend it and would come back if we were to return to the island.

Location wise it is in a quiet area, outside of the main hustle and bustle of Waikiki but you can easily reach places by car, or catch an uber into town which would cost about $18 dollars each way. It's a good location for getting around the island if you have a car as you can quickly and easily reach the main Highway to go North, East or\nWest. You also have a safe parking space for your car at the Studio. \n\nThe view from the studio is fantastic, especially on an evening. We spent a lot of time at the outside area enjoying the views of Diamond Head and the Ocean. The Studio itself is well equipped; good coffee machine, oven, lots of kitchen equipment, beach towels, toiletries and a great hairdryer. If you're planning to cook any of your own meals during your stay than this Studio is perfect. The studio is quite cosy but we never felt like it was too small, it was perfect for our stay. \n\nThe information we received about the booking was excellent, Andrei sent me a check in video so I could see how everything worked first hand, and an email with clear information. Andrei also very kindly let us drop our luggage off at the studio when we arrived as our flight got in very early, this then allowed us to go off for the day with no hassle and was very much appreciated! \n\nI would highly recommend the studio, I hope to be back!

We loved waking up to bird song early in the morning (be prepared or use ear plugs), having a cup of coffee on the deck and then starting our adventures.  The suite has  a Keurig coffee machine so don't buy ground coffee like I did!  The kitchen is well equipped.  There were many freezer ice packs and snap lid food containers that we used to pack picnic lunches--bring a cooler bag.   The shower is great!  The only thing you need to understand is that the long term renters' (very nice) kitchen window faces the private lanai, so anything you say or they say can be heard.  I found this awkward for the first day, but got over it and thoroughly enjoyed the premises.  Another plus, there is a conveniently located Whole Foods located 8 minutes away.

So if you are afraid of them, please be aware of this situation seriously. The location is very convenience, and it only takes 15mins driving to Waikiki beach, and 10mins to the closed grocery store. Overall, this is an amazing place, everybody should love it!"},{"_id":"200842080","date":{"$date":"2017-10-06T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10578580","reviewer_id":"42455671","reviewer_name":"Mattia","comments":"Andrei's studio has been the perfect spot for our vacation.\n\nThe place is way off the noisy part of the city, inside a peaceful and colorful residential borough up in the hills. Atmosphere was quiet and calm, with a brilliant view over Diamond Head and the Pacific. Car parking available 24/7. Easy access to the house.\n\nThe patio was great. Very nice spot where to enjoy a beer looking at the sunset.\n\nThe studio itself is minimal but has everything. Space for your clothes, very nice bathroom (great shower), and really a super equipped kitchen. We had chance to cook everything we wanted and also to prepare packed lunch. Brilliant.\n\nOne small bad thing is that we have had some issues with insects unfortunately. \n\nIn general, we had a great time at Andrei'a place and would love to come back in the future."},{"_id":"204375900","date":{"$date":"2017-10-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10578580","reviewer_id":"1810201","reviewer_name":"Jonathan","comments":"Amazing view.

Kitchen is luxerious but also small, things like a toaster are missing, everything only the minimum, 4 plates , 4 knifes, 4 forks, 4 cups some of them partly broken. The bed very small and dated. Highlight is the bathroom, very nice.\nAs described place has only hawain windows no curtains so if you either need a rather dark lace to sleep or if the neighbors have a party (the bed is just next to the barbeque of the other tenants) you can imagine that it is not easy to sleep.\n\nPatio: Wunderful view. Furniture dirty and dated. Partly not cleaned. \n\nAll of the above you may like or not however what we did not like at all was the existence of giant cockroaches  in the kitchen and the habits of the so called „host“ how just replied that cockroaches are normal and that he informed about this.\n\nI assume he will reply to our review that everything what we say is nonsense and he is right....\n\nWe like airbnb but this place where it all about making money.

Most noted from what I’ve read from others but disagree with are 1) bugs: bugs were never an issue and we often left the door open. Occasionally a moth or two would show up but we never saw any ants or roaches or anything based on what I’ve read. 2) the view: the view was incredible and waking up to the ocean every morning and going out onto the patio to have a coffee was a very romantic touch for my fiancé and I.\n\nThe only thing I would say is that if you are looking at spreading out and enjoy the luxury of having a lot of added space just verify that this place suits your needs. \n\nJhanna the host does a great job at communicating and is readily available for any and all needs. I felt very pampered every step of the way and truly enjoyed staying there as a result from her great hospitality. \n\nThank you for having us.

I was worried about insects but luckily had no encounter with bugs.  We made sure to keep the area clean and not leave any food around. The view from the patio was spectacular and we enjoyed having breakfast there every morning. The guesthouse is located beside other homes so at times it could be a little noisy, but overall not a huge concern for us.

The view can't be beat for that price, the bed was super cozy, and the water pressure in the spacious shower was really nice. The apartment is situated between a neighbor's home and another tenant. The tenants are quiet and neighbors came and went during our stay but note - with proximity to their place you can hear them talking pretty clearly if that bothers you. The neighbors also installed motion detector lights that are just outside the studio windows across from the bed. They were on all night (probably due to wind and trees). Andrei provides blankets to cover the windows, but it does not really block the light. If you are a light sleeper, bring a sleep mask. Be sure to clear any food and keep doors closed unless you want to see a visitor ;) We didn't see any until the last evening, but the biggest cockroach I've ever seen still startled me (I'm a spazz). The studio is treated, but the tropics can bring in some creepy crawlers. Overall we enjoyed our stay at the cozy studio. The porch is a gorgeous spot in the morning to enjoy your coffee and watch birds in the neighbors' yard."}]}

I have informed the householder at once. When we arrived at the airport, we could not find the driver waiting for us at the arrival with our name. Then, I tried to ask for the help from the householder to meet the driver at the airport. After almost one-hour waiting, we are refused by the driver to meet at the airport and He asked us to find his car at the park. How ridiculous! This service costs 20 euro each person but we cannot even have the right to be picked up. We were so angry and chose to take the taxi. At the same time, I texted the householder that we were tired of waiting for the driver and we were on the way to ur apartment by taxi.\n\nThe householder didn't tell me that I should phone another guy to tell him that we were on the way to the apartment until We arrived. What all she talked about were the money of the pick-up service. We spent another 45 minutes to wait for the guy to send the key. Again, when he came, he talked about the money. We asked for the service, but u did not provide it with us. How dare u to ask for the payment? Besides, do u know what? We are totally seven people, so this service should cost 140 euro totally. But two taxis only cost us 70 euro. The driver knows the guy and the householder. I doubt that they are on the business to play trick with me.\n\nBarcelona is a really nice city to travel, but this experience does make a bad impression on me. \n "},{"_id":"86425734","date":{"$date":"2016-07-16T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10581101","reviewer_id":"47750495","reviewer_name":"Glen","comments":"The apartment has a good location convenient to metro and walking distance to Sagrada Familia and many good eating options.

Oltre ai vari letti vi era anche la possibilità di dormire su un divano letto particolarmente comodo. L'aria condizionata funzionava e rinfrescava bene tutto l'appartamento. L'unico problemino c'è stato con la porta del bagno che è stato facile chiudere, ma non più riaprire, ma c'è stato subito un pronto intervento da parte dei responsabili dell'appartamento, che hanno aiutato ad uscire la persona che era rimasta chiusa all'interno. Salvo questo però Il quartiere era tranquillo , c'erano vari baretti attorno e anche dei piccoli centri commerciali ( di tipo alimentare ). Era in oltre possibile raggiungere a piedi vari bar dove potersi divertire. I taxi per arrivare nel centro della movida variano con i prezzi dai 5 ai 7 euro a corsa. La fermata della metro era a 5 min a piedi dall'appartamento. Dal centro partiva una navetta che portava direttamente all'aeroporto per soli 4 euro e 90.

The bathrooms were not very well equipped, there was no soap and only few toalet paper, but upon request Regina's staff brought us some. We did not use the kitchen that much.

L'appartement est très joli, bien décoré, dans une rue très typique et charmante. Par contre, il est totalement insonorisé. Durant toute notre semaine de vacances, l'immeuble en face était en travaux. Tous les jours dès 8h du matin, nous avons eu le plaisir de partager le bruit des marteaux piqueurs et des marteaux. Ce fut très ennuyant et surtout très fatiguant. Autre petit bémol, si l'appartement est fait pour recevoir 6 personnes (3 lits 2 places), il est impossible de se réunir à 6 pour manger puisqu'il n'y a pas de table (à part une petite table en plastique pour 2 personnes).

In between river and upper city - easy walk everywhere. Apt is a shabby chic style. Mathieu was helpful over phone but we did not meet him although he said to call if we needed anything. Would stay again if in Porto.\nBed linens could be of higher quality ( especially compared to a similar Airbnb in Lisbon). \nKitchen is functional but there were not enough plates, mugs or wine glasses for the 5 of us so some extras would be nice. He left us a supply coffee, sugar, tea which was nice.\nBathroom is functional but tight - great shower and good hot water supply.

We didn't meet Mathieu however he was accessible by message/phone and responded quickly, even booking a taxi to the airport for us. \nWe used 2 of the 3 bedrooms and found the beds comfortable. Only 1 bedroom has external windows. The bathroom floor area is very small although the shower which is over a bath was roomy and had hot powerful water. Kitchen is roomy for cooking and has microwave, stove top and oven however the eating table is small and would struggle to seat more than 2 or 3.\nExcellent new washing machine.  \nUnfortunately the wooden stairs for entering the building and to the apartments mean it is noisy when people are coming and going and you could hear the people in the apartment above  walking around. Maybe an issue for light sleepers.\nThe apartments front rooms (lounge and a bedroom) have a bit of a view through to the river and to buildings in the distance which was nice especially at night seeing the lights. Close to Restauarnt Fado, the river and 10 mins walk with bags to Sao Bento train station and metro."},{"_id":"210824784","date":{"$date":"2017-11-11T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10628126","reviewer_id":"6088533","reviewer_name":"Mikhail","comments":"Отличная просторная квартира, 5 минут от центральной набережной, 10 минут от вокзала.

There’s are loads of places to eat and drink nearby and Mathieu was really helpful with regular tips about the best places locally and further afield. The old town where the apartment is , is a great place to explore but it’s really worth venturing elsewhere also and the buses are good and easy to use. We went to the beaches several times using the 500 bus. The flat itself is a perfect size for 6 people and there is a bed settee I believe but we didn’t use it. I think more than 6 would be overcrowded. Every thing we needed was provided. We didn’t need to ask Mathieu for any changes but he was very approachable and friendly and I am certain he would sort any problems out quickly. He sent us regular messages with ideas for things to do and places to go.

Tudo que conquistei foi graças ao sucesso no Airbnb!\r\n\r\nMinha experiência começou quando recebi um flat da minha avó através de herança (em vida!!), investi pesado na reforma do apartamento para poder oferecer o maior conforto possível aos meus hóspedes. Comecei a administrar seu aluguel e o sucesso foi tão grande que mudou a minha vida!\r\n\r\nMeus amigos e familiares viram como o meu “negócio” estava dando certo e começaram a pedir para que eu também administrasse o aluguel dos apartamentos deles (nessa época ainda não existia a figura do co-host). \r\n\r\nTopei o desafio e o número de apartamentos foi se multiplicando! O resultado foi ótimo e percebi que me sentia muito realizado com as experiências que estava ganhando como empreendedor e ao conhecer pessoas de tantos lugares do mundo! De tal maneira que decidi largar meu emprego como gestor em marketing para me dedicar exclusivamente a vocês!\r\n\r\nFiz um curso de guia de turismo para ter mais conhecimento sobre a cidade e abri a All in Rio, uma Agência de Turismo que oferece tours culturais, naturais e de aventura, além do aluguel de apartamentos de temporada.\r\n\r\nMeu objetivo é oferecer uma estadia segura, confortável e poder fornecer todas as informações necessárias para você desfrutar ao máximo a sua experiência em nossa cidade maravilhosa! \r\n\r\nObrigado pela atenção!\r\n\r\nFabio\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nHi!\r\n\r\nI've been on Airbnb since 2011 and I’m a big fan of the Platform. All I got was thanks to my success on Airbnb!\r\n\r\nMy experience began when I received a flat from my grandmother through inheritance (in life!!). I invested heavily in the renovation of the apartment to be able to offer the greatest comfort possible to my guests. I started managing the rent and the success was so amazing that it changed my life!\r\n\r\nMy friends and family noticed how well my \"business\" was going and started to ask me to manage their apartment’s rent too (at the time, the figure of  the co-host didn’t exist).\r\n\r\nI accepted the challenge and the number of apartments was multiplying! The result was great and I realized that I felt very fulfilled with the experiences I was gaining as an entrepreneur and by meeting people from so many places in the world! So I decided to leave my job as a marketing manager to dedicate myself exclusively to you!\r\n\r\nI took a tour guide course to gain more knowledge about the city and opened the All in Rio, a Tourism Agency that offers cultural, natural and adventure tours, as well as apartments for seasonal rents.\r\n\r\nMy goal is to offer you a safe and comfortable stay and to be able to provide all the information necessary so you can enjoy your experience in our wonderful city to the fullest!\r\n\r\nThank you for your time!\r\n\r\nFabio\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nComments from my guests:\r\n\r\n“This apartment is in the most amazing location. Leblon is beautiful, safe, and packed with fabulous restaurants. The apartment is just by the ocean - couldn't really be better. Communicating with Fabio was super-easy. He was really responsive and helpful. We are missing it already!” - Ed Pilkington (UK)\r\n“Fabio goes far and beyond the average host, my trip was a day earlier than I booked and I would have been stuck with no place to stay but Fabio personally went out of his way to get the place ready for me, great guy and will always go to him first when traveling to Rio. Thank again Fabio abs!!” - Darren Sanford (USA)\r\n“O apartamento é lindo como nas fotos e a localização é perfeita! O Fábio é super atencioso e respondeu super rápido nossas dúvidas.

Fabio was a very accommodating host. I would definitely stay there again.” - Jordan Giordano (USA)\r\n“Our stay at Fabio’s place was fantastic! The apartment is simply beautiful and it made us feel at home. Super stylish and cozy. We are very particular about the properties we stay at, and this one exceeded our expectations The apartment description was very accurate! We loved being so close to the beach and all the great restaurants around. Thank you very much!”- Pablo Perez (Canadá)\r\n“Fabio was a perfect host.  He answered promptly all our questions and is a really nice guy!”- Daniela (Brasil)\r\n “Fabio is the perfect host.

The place is cozy and immaculate. Other than the bed being a bit stiff, I loved being in the apartment. The water was hot, the wi-fi worked perfectly. The only negative that I had about the room was the noise. \r\n\r\nThe unit is situated on the 2nd floor of the building right outside a busy street. Every night around midnight, two bars would open up across the and start blaring music. The music would not stop until 8am the next morning. I ended up having to buy a white noise machine just to last through the night.\r\n\r\nThe only other feedback I had was around Fabio, the host. All of the reviews mentioned how responsive and helpful he was. However that was not the case for me. The day I booked, I couldn't get him to respond to the booking. I even had to have AirBnB call him. And then I asked him about touring the city. Instead of offering, he pointed me to a few self serve options. When I asked again, he said he would plan a trip then never responded. When I responded to him, he said he was too busy and my trip was over. \r\n\r\nFabio being my tour guide is not a huge requirement, but I had thought he would be more willing (or suggest someone), given the feedback people had for him o this site.\r\n\r\nAll in all, great place if you don't mind the noise and don't need a helpful host.

Fabio was understanding about our delay but we were a bit embarassed that we had kept him waiting.  The apartment was  centrally located (within walking distance to the beach), clean, modern, and compact with 24 hour security.  We don't speak any Portugese but Fabio was able to communicate with us in English and was extremely helpful in providing all relavant information including a map.  He suggested restaurants, how to purchase tickets for tourist attractions and marked most things out on the map.  He also suggested visiting the hippy markets that are open on Sundays - which we really enjoyed.  Fabio was a wonderful, helpful host and it was obvious he wanted us to enjoy his apartment and our trip to Rio.  Only bug bear was spare towels (ie none are provided).  Our bath towels got wet after the 1st day and although we hung them out to dry on the balcony - they didn't really get dry.  I think the problem was a little to do with us - we had just finished a cruise and linen was plentiful so we became a little spoilt - anyway we adjusted our routine (used the hand towels) so it wasn't a major problem.  Rio was fantastic, a really interesting place to visit.  I am sure anyone wishing to go to the Olympics stay at Fabio's - he is very helpful.  He arranged our transport getting back to the airport which worked out perfectly.  Thanks Fabio for the wonderful stay - love love loved it!

We never stop living and learning, and whatever you are planning on doing in Rio de Janeiro, you will continue on this path with an open mind in Rio, and add an important chapter to your personal travel memoire, just by absorbing a few of the experiences Rio has on offer. I have travelled most of the world, and still come alive to the sounds of the different rhythms, love the extraordinary food, and the warmth of the local \"cariocas\". I would say my favorite film so far this year is Intouchables.

It has a real tree house feel to it.  Sherrie showed me how to feed papaya peels to the donkey, and Mr. Chris, the cat, bounded in the door when I opened it and spent the nights with me on the king-size bed, which was a treat for me.

Little touches throughout the home really tie everything together. the property is somewhat remote but only a short drive to town, the beach, and Volcano national park. You get the perks of being surrounded in rainforest and privacy but still get convenience, wifi, and hot water. \nSherri was so helpful with anything we needed; she shared her art supplies with me and loaned us snorkel equipment and pool noodles after telling us the best spots on the island. \nSherri and the animals were all sweet hearts. My favorite was the lovable pup, the friendly donkey and the happy chickens walking about the yard. She provided fresh fruit daily and offered us any fruit growing on the property. She even gave me a beautiful bouquet to take home with me. It was wonderful! \nMy fiancé and I decided to get married on the big island, and we TRULY could not have had a better time or stayed anywhere better. Great for couples who want to adventure but have somewhere beautiful to come home to!

It's very much an interior room, not just by a hall and a living room, but also by a staircase, the bathroom and the kitchen. It's in the center of the apartment. The openings are sheet rocked in, so have no insulation. There is no separation from the owner's unit downstairs. What this means is that sound (all sounds, casual sounds, everything)  is completely transparent within the room. I would not recommend for a light sleeper, or for someone who needs to feel a sense of privacy. \r\nI also wrote up front about what I needed. I didn't feel listened to at all. Then I was blamed being for not being up front (apparently because I didn't emphasize that I seriously needed what I needed), and then was also told when I was angry that my communication style is overwhelming. It actually made me feel pretty \"gas lighted.\"\r\nFinally, the apartment is extremely expensive even by NYC standards. My friends who visited me during my month long stay were aghast. They felt that what I was paying for the room was close to what the rent probably was for the whole apartment.\r\n...On the up-side the place is clean, and the neighborhood is great. The landlord downstairs is very nice too. For a few days of visiting if you're not noise sensitive, the apartment could be quite fine if you don't mind the price.

What started as a coffee plantation in the mid-1800s is now the largest planned development on Kauai. Princeville is home to some of the finest resorts, golf courses and restaurants on the islands. Kauai’s north shore is also where you’ll find some of the most spectacular scenery in Hawaii. There are three main beaches in Princeville, which are Kenomene Beach, Kaweonui Beach and Puu Poa Beach. A wide reef along these beaches creates warm pockets for swimming and snorkeling in calm weather. Other area activities include tennis, golf, windsurfing, kayaking, fishing, sailing, helicopter tours and shopping. You can arrange for a private guided jungle hike, waterfall excursion or kayaking adventure. ","notes":"The pool and hot tub are available for your use until 9 pm.  Sorry no pets or smoking.","transit":"The Kauai Bus is just about one mile away at the shopping center.","access":"There are gardens, ponds, flowers, fruit trees, and lawn area that you are free to enjoy as well as a small garden patio with table and chairs.

","interaction":"We love meeting our guests and hearing about their lives and other travels, but they are free as well to enjoy as much seclusion and privacy as they wish.","house_rules":"Here are a few things that may be helpful to your stay. Please do not leave fan or lights on when you are not in residence. As in all resorts, no towels on balcony railing but on chairs is fine. Also observe Hawaiian tradition of \"no shoes\" in house. No loud noise or music after 9pm.  Please rinse beach items off after use by patio shower. Please use rags under kitchen or bath sink to clean off Kauai red dirt (not bath or beach towels!). Do not take bath towels to the beach. AT\u0026T phones get poor service here. WiFi available.  Queen's Bath is right across the street. It is a natural volcanic lava pool. Please observe the warning signs at the top of the path. Always keep an eye on the ocean and stay off wet rocks as that means waves have broken over them. Also the path can be slippery when wet.  The pool and hot tub are for your pleasure from 9am - 9pm.  Do not park overnight on the grass. It is against Princeville rules.  Please tell us if you have a concern.

Coral also offered my wife an awesome walking stick for the hike to the falls.\r\nAfter the long hike, we came back and treated our sore muscles to the jacuzzi.  There is also a grill if you feel inclined to cook in the courtyard.  \r\nLast, parking was free, and there is direct access (across the street) to Queens Bath which is incredible in the summertime.  \r\n\r\nBe sure to also ask about where to sit back and watch the sunset from the cliff overlooking Queen's bath just a short 2 minute walk from the room.\r\n"},{"_id":"40433082","date":{"$date":"2015-07-31T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1069531","reviewer_id":"1775906","reviewer_name":"Bunny","comments":"Our hosts were very welcoming and generous with their home!

Coral and Ian were so welcoming and friendly and the place was beautiful.  We loved waking up and coming home to such beautiful surroundings, with sounds of waves, birds, and frogs, and lovely gardens adding to the serenity.  The room and small \"kitchen\" area fulfilled all our needs for small meals at home, and we were generously offered the use of the grill and house kitchen if we felt inspired to do more.  On lazy days we enjoyed playing scrabble in the courtyard and watching the birds at the coconut feeder.  We loved being across the street from the trail to Queen's bath and had several wonderful sunsets there watching the sea turtles and the endangered shearwaters (our best guess) coming home to roost for the night in the cliff banks.   This was an amazingly good first experience with airbnb."},{"_id":"77933621","date":{"$date":"2016-06-04T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1069531","reviewer_id":"47671922","reviewer_name":"Michele","comments":"The Garden Room was the perfect home base for our week of discovering the magical North Shore of Kauai.

The room was clean, quiet, comfortable and felt private. Even though the pool and hot tub are in a shared courtyard, whenever we wanted to use them we had them to ourselves. We totally enjoyed our stay in this beautiful location. Coral and Ian were very welcoming and hospitable, yet totally respected our privacy. I really enjoyed photographing the flowers and tropical plants with the gorgeous and unique home as a backdrop.

We really wanted to see and experience Kauai the best we could. When we saw Coral's ad on Airbnb we knew it would fit all of our wants and needs. Upon arriving, we were welcomed by her husband Ian who took us around their beautiful property. Location is a huge plus with this hidden gem, it is only steps away from Queen's bath and a short 5 minute ride from Hanalei, which we frequented. The pool was beautiful, even though we only used it once. Coral does a great job in making sure her guests are comfortable. Her hospitality is in a league of it's own from offering fresh fruit she grew herself to local insights on what to do and where to go. We stayed in Princeville just before their winter months. It was mostly on the windier side, but it did not inhibit our travels. The only one  recommendation we have is if you decide to take a boat tour to the Na Pali Coast to see the open-ceiling caves, go during the summer or when the swells are below 4ft. Whale season is just starting at the end of October, so keep that in mind too if you do decide to take a boat tour. Otherwise, here are our top 5 picks picks Kauai: 1. Kalalau Trail (bring shoes with traction!), 2. Ishihara Market for Poke (see Waimea Canyon same day), 3. Lawai Beach for Snorkeling (next to The Beach House), 4. Queen's Bath (sunny and low swells), 5. Kilauea Town (bakery, juice bar, lighthouse lookout). Enjoy your stay in Kauai! Mahalo!

The property was great; we loved the pool and hot tub in the beautiful courtyard. But the room itself was perhaps the dirtiest Airbnb I've ever stayed in. The bathroom rug was badly stained, the fan was filthy, the walls all need a scrubbing and perhaps repainting. If you're not bothered by cleanliness issues, then you'll probably like this place a lot. \n\nAs far as location, Queen's Bath and Hideaways beach are both awesome destinations within walking distance (and both have parking challenges, so walking is a big advantage). Be aware that a lot of the most popular tourist destinations/activities are far away, especially with part of the North Shore currently closed. Waimea Canyon is two hours away; most tours like flying and ziplining are 45+ minutes. The nearby grocery store (Princeville Foodland) is the most expensive place on the island so stock up on groceries closer to the airport."},{"_id":"331486248","date":{"$date":"2018-10-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1069531","reviewer_id":"1429129","reviewer_name":"Rick","comments":"This is an inexpensive place in a million dollar location.

My friend and I stayed in a more modest room but it had everything we needed and we were comfortable. We spent most of our time outside on the property or exploring the island so a simple room was perfect, especially on a budget.  It can be warm at night but the fan works well. I struggled a lot with the WiFi and had no cell phone service. I’m sure Coral would have reset the WiFi if we asked but for me it wasn’t necessary and I enjoyed being “unplugged” so to speak.

My wife and I thought we took a wrong turn...  We didn't.  It's very very nice.  The value I was getting increased 2-fold when we pulled into the location.  \n\nCoral got me an amazing deal on a rental car.  We do not require much, and our car wasn't much.  But, it had 4 tires, A/C, great gas mileage, and pick up from the airport.  If you just need a basic car, do not go to the rental places at the airport.  Talk to Coral.\n\nThe room was what we saw on the site.  It's clean, comfortable, and is set up for you to enjoy a quick, small meal at \"home\" when you want to save some money or enjoy your own cooking.  There is ground coffee and a machine which we used every day.  Refrigerator, plates, utensils, blender (Yes, I made Pina Coladas in our room), microwave and hot plate.  Everything you need.\n\n The rainy nights were an absolute joy.  Hearing the rain on the big leafy bush in the front window was relaxing and gave that extra atmosphere of being away and relaxed.\n\nThe grounds of Asia House are amazing and welcoming.  You will love your stay here.  \n\nMy only suggestion would be a ceiling fan.  The fan provided is adequate.  Our last day was the most humid.  My wife and just sat in front of the fan to get relief.  A ceiling fan would be amazing.  However, this does not change the fact that if we go back to Kauai, we are staying at Asia House.  It's a real gem.

We stayed in the lovely garden studio which was private and quiet. They supplied us with all the necessities we needed for a comfortable stay, fruits from their garden, coffee and condiments, and a nice sized fridge in the room. An indoor shower in our room as well as an outdoor shower to clean off the unavoidable mud from adventuring! We are so grateful to have had this quiet landing pad after long excursions with a firm bed to come home to. They have tips for staying cool and a fan in the room.

The Gaudi Guell Park is an uphill walk of about 900 meters.  Our room and bathroom were clean and the beds comfortable for our family of three.  The internet worked well and her rooftop terrace was pleasant for afternoon tea and breakfast.  In fact, Nuria offered us tea on the roof upon our arrival.  We enjoyed having use of the kitchen during our stay.  The elevator in her building was nice for carrying luggage up and down.  Our Spanish and Nuria’s English were minimal, but we were able to communicate.  This is certainly not a luxurious place, but good for those traveling within a budget.

Our flight was delayed and we didn't arrive until 10pm, but I was able to notify her through (Hidden by Airbnb) just before we took off and she was fine about it. She  has a small VW Pollo which we just managed to fit all 3 of our big bags in to, plus us 3 and Nuria! She pointed out the closest metro station (Lesseps) on the way to her house and made us tea on the Terrace upon arrival to her home. She doesn't speak English so we communicated in Spanish. The room was fine for us, a very narrow apartment, as are most apartments in Barcelona. A small lift was good to take our luggage up as the apartment is the top of 6 or so levels. We had a fan in our room and a big open window which was great as it was hot! Shower is either hot or cold and bathroom shared with another guest room. Towels provided. Showers between 7:00 and 22:00 as bathroom is inbetween the 2 guest rooms and that rule is to help keep noise levels to a minimum for any guests who might prefer to sleep from 10pm. Approx 15 mins walk to Park Guell which was great! And about 25 mins walk to La Sagrada Familia. A really great fruit/vegetable/organic produce with the best of everything just a few streets away. Access to fridge available on request. Access to cutlery, crockery and microwave (not oven or stove). Great strong wifi connection. A few barking dogs in the neighborhood, but otherwise quiet. Nuria kindly offered for us to leave our luggage for the day as we were checking out, but we didn't need to. Nuria seemed to do a bit of work from home, she kept out of our way, but was around if we had needed to ask her anything. Over all our stay was good.

We found plenty of places in the neighborhood just walking to our destinations, although you might want to search online beforehand so you know where you're going exactly, especially at night. Pleasant walks to Park Güell and Sagrada Familia. We got to the Cathedral via metro no problem, and my friend and I are no experts at public transportation. If we can figure it out, anyone can. The wifi didn't work for us but we didn't really need it for such a short stay and it was no problem, we didn't even mention it (we think it might have been our phones). We stayed for 2 whole days and 3 nights, and we saw everything we wanted to see. Would recommend for a short trip where you don't mind feeling like you're at sleep away camp with your bunkmates. Núria also gave us a ride to and from the airport and that was a good experience as well."},{"_id":"33111207","date":{"$date":"2015-05-25T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1070322","reviewer_id":"25500627","reviewer_name":"Cécile","comments":"Everything was perfect.

Even though the station is so close, you can't hear the trains from the room, so a good night's sleep is guaranteed. The room itself is very big and gorgeous! Natasa really has an eye for decorating and designed the room to be not only beautiful but very functional! There is tons of storage space, including two locking bedside cabinets. The kitchen is also wonderful and Natasa was kind enough to let us use a shelf in the pantry and another in the fridge. We loved staying here so much and were so sad to leave!

Natasa as a host is what makes this more that a place to just crash. She is a very sweet woman who gave us some great insights into the city. She even showed us the best (and secret) place to get front row for the NYE fireworks overlooking the bridge and harbour. \r\n\r\nWith this being the first Air bnb experience for us we were a little anxious, but as soon as we arrived, we were sure we had made the best decision.\r\n\r\nTravellers may want to consider a rail card if choosing this location as it saves lots of money for those staying a few days or more.

Natasa is very welcoming, and she made me feel right at home from the moment I got there.  She is generous and flexible--and one of the happiest people to be around.  Natasa always had the perfect suggestion of where to go, what to do or the best way to get there.  She knows the city really well, and is always happy to give suggestions (or show you herself!).  Natasa will talk with you as much or as little as you want, but we had a great time hanging out downstairs--I never felt like I needed to be in my room.  She even invited me to her famous pizza night with her friends--yum!\r\n\r\nAs for the house/room--it was great.  The location is amazing--so close to both the Petersham train station and a short walk to all of the Parramatta Rd buses.  Everything you need will be close by or short walk away.  The house is great--clean, homely and has everything you need! The green room was perfect--great hard wood floors, comfortable bed, plenty of space for my things--as advertised.  Even with 3 or 4 of us in the house, I never had to wait for the bathroom--everyone had such different schedules that it always seemed to work out.  I did laundry quite a few times while I was there, which was no problem at all--there is a dryer or clothes line.  \r\n\r\nI would not hesitate for a second to book this house again!  It made my time working away from home so much better by being around lovely people in a very nice home.  I loved it and I hope I get the chance to visit Natasa in Petersham again soon!"},{"_id":"15372991","date":{"$date":"2014-07-07T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1073607","reviewer_id":"11220655","reviewer_name":"Gordon","comments":"Staying with Natasa was great, lovely house and lovely host.

Alot of movies are provided in living room that you can select among them and watch. Also you can enjoy the lovely kitchen and the terrace. Being completely close to trian station, it is perfect for new arrivals like me. Also, the area is completely close to city center. When Natasa is at home you can enjoy talking with her. Unfortunately, we could not see each other so much since most of that time she was on a business trip. However among afew talks that we had, I enjoyed her manner and kindness. Beside your room, there are two other bedrooms in the first floor that you should share bathroom with them. It was ok and we had no problem.

She insisted on carrying my massive suitcase up the stairs for me, while explaining the layout of her home. She even suggested a wonderful spot for brunch for my friend and I. (I should actually say even before I arrived since she was extremely flexible and allowed me to alter my stay to a couple days later). My entire stay was extremely comfortable. Natasa gives the perfect balance of privacy and companionship to her guests. She never once disturbed me, but was always willing to have a chat on the rare occasion that we crossed paths (we both were in and out of the house quite often). Any time I was unsure of something she was available by text and always had a quick response. The location is also extremely convenient as it is only about a block from the Petersham station where I was able to catch either the bus or train to wherever I needed to go. You can take the bus to a grocery store, but Norton Plaza has 2 grocers as well as other little shops, and is only about a 10min walk. My only regret is that I did not book Natasa's place for my entire trip! If I return to Sydney I will definitely be booking her home again, and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient location, hosted by an extremely friendly and hospitable individual."},{"_id":"191821238","date":{"$date":"2017-09-09T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1073607","reviewer_id":"1639678","reviewer_name":"Anna","comments":"Friendly"},{"_id":"196048504","date":{"$date":"2017-09-21T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1073607","reviewer_id":"87014173","reviewer_name":"Maria","comments":"Nataša is a perfect host offering a cozy, clean and comfortable place to stay."},{"_id":"200541337","date":{"$date":"2017-10-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1073607","reviewer_id":"46686673","reviewer_name":"Natasha","comments":"Great host, great house, comfortable room.

Just out of sight is one of the most attractive parts of Istanbul. After a couple of minutes’ walk from Taksim, its arrival is heralded by a great old-fashioned Istanbul patisserie, Savoy. Across the street and down the stairs is Otto, a fashionable café/bar in a shady tree-filled courtyard. A little further along is Pilot, a pioneering contemporary art space housed in a converted 1970s nightclub. Opposite is a square with the pastel-green Firuz Ağa Mosque and a few cafés that are always busy, including two where you strictly drink tea, lovingly known to the locals as the Cihangir çay bahçesi. Also try Firuz and Kardeşler Kebap. Opposite these, you’ll find a branch of Selim Usta’s Tarihi Sultanahmet Köftecisi, an Old City institution.

There is no noise at night, while there are plenty of nice coffees and restaurant very close. There is also a tram station to get to old Istanbul (Sulthnamet) walking distance,15mn walk down the hill. \r\nThe appartment itself is very nicely decorated, very clean and confortable. Only you should know, if you do not come in the summer, that there is no central heating, only one portative heater that you can move one room to another. In March, we were quite cold. So we would recommand with no hesitation the place, but preferably with summer weather."},{"_id":"12442416","date":{"$date":"2014-05-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1074008","reviewer_id":"14614971","reviewer_name":"KinMun","comments":"Pia's place was fantastic.

And if you need the metro, it's also walking distance.\n\nPia was very helpful and even though I arrived late at night, she waited for me and spoke to the taxi driver to give him instructions.\n\nAnd Pia even made the effort to take us around despite her busy schedule.

The size is not as big as it looks on the pics and the real location of the apartment is about 4 blocks more far away form the city center. The apartment doesn't have a laundry (I could see it on the pictures of the listing). You have to use and external laundry which costs 7.- Euro each time.

Clean, compact, safe location.  Steps away from the metro which gets you to anywhere in the city.  Quite neighborhood and building which is really nice for active travelers who need to rejuvenate after long days and nights of sightseeing.  The kitchen had the basics for quick meal prep if you eat in a couple of times.  Clean new bathroom with a large shower.  Great large patio which does get hot during the day.  Gabriela and Miquel were accommodating and get back to you very quickly with answers to any questions you may have.  I was new to the airbnb experience and it could not have gone better being quests of these two hosts. Our family of four did well in the bed situation. One double bed in a small bedroom, a twin in a smaller bedroom and a double pull out couch.  Internet was strange a couple of times but it could just have needed a siesta!

Me alojé en el apartamento de Gabriela pues queda muy cerca del mismo (5-7 minutos paseando). \r\n\r\n¿Cómo son las habitaciones?:\r\nLa habitación principal da a un patio interior de la comunidad, es muy tranquila, se oye un poco la maquinaria del ascensor por el día porque está cerca, pero por la noche es silenciosa ya que el edificio es de ambiente familiar, acogedor y se respeta el descanso nocturno. De cualquier modo la zona es tranquila, y de noche mucho más. No hay ruido de tráfico ni nada por el estilo. Yo descansé muy bien.\r\nLa habitación pequeña en realidad es un espacio semiabierto que se comunica con el salón. Y da a la terraza principal. Suuuuper tranquila.\r\n\r\nPositivos:\r\n- El apartamento es un sobreático así que no hay vecinos en esa planta, sólo tú. La terraza es increíble, vistas maravillosas sobre los tejados y colinas al atardecer. En mi caso era casi octubre y ya refrescaba por la noche pero me imaginé que en verano se estaría muy bien cenando allí mismo. \r\n- El Aire Acondicionado funciona perfectamente, de maravilla. Y lo hay en todas las estancias. ¡De lujo!\r\n- WIFI disponible.\r\n- El piso está nuevo y muy limpio. Las fotos se corresponden con la realidad. No hay sorpresas. Decorado sin artificios. Básico pero funcional.\r\n- Farmacia y supermercado en la misma calle, así como papelería y varios bares y cafeterías. \r\n- Boca de metro a escasos metros.\r\n\r\nPosibles Negativos (según necesidades del viajero):\r\n- El agua caliente de la ducha se agota de allí a un tiempo (calentador) y hay que esperar a que el tanque esté nuevamente caliente. Para mi que viajaba sola, era más que suficiente para una agradable y larga ducha. Para más personas supongo habría que tenerlo en cuenta y programarse. O ser breve (ecofriendly!) De cualquier modo es un aspecto menor.\r\n- El ascensor llega hasta el ático. Para llegar al sobreático hay que subir un pequeño tramo de escaleras. Para mi no supuso ningún problema, ni lo supondrá para cualquier viajero joven y en forma. Pero está bien saberlo en caso de personas con problemas de movilidad o para quienes lleven equipajes muy pesados.\r\n\r\nRealmente no son aspectos negativos sino simplemente a tener en cuenta! Mi estancia fue muy agradable y sin incidencias con una perfecta comunicación con mi anfitrión. Así que recomiendo este apartamento sin dudarlo.\r\n\r\nGracias Gabriela!\r\n\r\n"},{"_id":"7870897","date":{"$date":"2013-10-07T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1079887","reviewer_id":"7168610","reviewer_name":"Hale","comments":"We arrived very late in the evening and miguel was so nice and waited for us in the appartment.

Asunto oli loistava pienelle perheelle ja tarvittaessa siellä olisi mahtunut yöpymään useampikin. Asunto vastasi täysin kuvausta,  tai oli jopa parempi! Kuvat eivät anna oikeutta asunnolle. Asunto on hiljattain remontoitu, todella siisti ja erityismaininta jokaisessa huoneessa erikseen olleesta ilmastointilaitteesta. Tullessamme, asunto oli siivottu todella siistiksi ja tuoksui raikkaalta -melkein kuin olisi tullut hotelliin! Asunto oli myös hyvin rauhallinen, naapureista ei kuulunut mitään ääniä. \r\n\r\nMyös Miguel ja Gabriella toimivat loistavia isäntinä: heidät sai hyvin kiinni ennen matkaa, aiemman check-in ajan sopiminen onnistui ongelmitta, asunnolla oltiin vastaanottamassa meitä hyvissä ajoin, Miguel auttoi meitä kantamaan matkatavaramme asuntoon, ongelmatilanteissa saimme apua muutaman tunnin sisällä ja he jopa lähettivät asunnolle unohtuneet matkatavarat postilla peräämme! \r\n\r\nAsunnon läheisyydestä löytyi metroasema, pieniä kauppoja ja edullisia paikallisten suosimia ravintoloita, joskin niissä ymmärrettiin melko heikosti englantia :). Asunnolta oli jonkin verran matkaa esim. Tripadvisorin suosittelemiin ravintoloihin eixamplessa, mutta metrolla pääsi kulkemaan suht vaivattomasti myös lapsen kanssa.\r\n\r\nAsunto ja isännät olivat siis huippuja! Enempää emme olisi voineet toivoa asunnolta tässä hintaluokassa. Yksi asia, mikä kannattaa kuitenkin huomioida tämän asunnon kohdalla on se, ettei hissillä pääse suoraan asunnon kerrokseen vaan hissiltä tarvitsee nousta vielä yksi kerros ylöspäin portaita pitkin.\r\n\r\nKiitos majoittamisestamme, viihdyimme hyvin asunnossanne!"},{"_id":"37571941","date":{"$date":"2015-07-08T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1079887","reviewer_id":"9918897","reviewer_name":"Gustavo","comments":"Very nice flat.

Miguel met us and explained everything also leaving us a contact number (which we never needed as all worked without fail.) The terrace was wonderful. We did purchase a small lawn chair from a shop across the street to lounge in the sun and left it for future guests to enjoy. Laundry set up is great. Washer is in a small room on the terrace which is also where you hang the clothes for drying. That little hotbox gets the clothes dry in a hurry. \r\nNeighborhood was exactly what we wanted. Good bars, restaurants and markets in the area, so good neighborhood feel away from main tourist streets and crowds. Walk a few blocks to The Bar on Calabria. Outstanding small restaurant with friendly owner and great food well priced.\r\nYou could walk everywhere (we did!), but better to get a metro pass (as we also did) which will get you everywhere. A stop (Entenca) is less than half a block away. We got a ten trip pass which lasted a week.

We didn't get to spend much time with him, but he made sure we found the apartment and got situated in our room.\r\n\r\nThe apartment is communal, and quite bohemian. Photographs of gurus and flower child murals decorate the walls. The street seemed to be plucked right out of Amsterdam. Odors abound. \r\n\r\nThe beds are a bit like military cots, and in the summer when we visited, we were hugging our small electric fan whenever we were in the room. If you're adventurous and planning to trek for most of your trip, this probably won't be an issue for you.\r\n\r\nThe hike up a winding staircase to the room might be an issue for some visitors--we were traveling with our three-year-old and our return to our room after long days under the summer sun made us dream of an elevator.\r\nBy the map, the apartment looked like a quick jaunt to the beach, but in reality it was more like a 20 minute walk. I was quite surprised by how expansive Barcelona is. There is plenty of life on the avenues below--a playground for children is located in the middle of a small plaza that offers a number of vegetarian restaurants and bars.\r\n\r\nAccess to La Rambla might be the biggest benefit of this location. It's about a one minute walk to the crowded thoroughfare, and that means you have immediate access to Barcelona's metro, as well as the airport shuttles.\r\n\r\nAnother minor perk worth mentioning: the communal kitchen was stocked with cereals, which I imagine would provide a quick meal to the ultra-budgeted backpacker. It helped us out when wrangling with our picky son, still hungry after a halfhearted pass at tapas and paella.\r\n\r\nSo anyway, Flo's place I think would be best suited to adventurous backpackers and young students, but the price certainly makes it worth considering for small families on a shoestring budget. If you can live without some creature comforts, you'll be happy have this as a crash and launch pad, sweating out the night to the lively ambience of bustling Barcelona below.

The place is a small room located in an apartment complex on the second floor (note: 3 flights of stairs to climb). It has a great, central location, but it feels smaller than what the pictures present and can get pretty cramped with luggages on the floor. The place is mostly clean. With only one desk fan, it can get pretty hot in the summer (mid-July). One of the beds had a overly soft, spongy mattress that was kind of difficult to sleep in, but we managed okay. This is a very minimal room (especially for three people), good for travellers trying to save money without a cheaper option.

Cleaning lady was lovely, and very friendly and helpful whenever I ran into her at the apartment.\r\n\r\nAs others have mentioned, the photos are very deceptive. In reality, the room is like half the size of what the photos implies. And not nearly as light either. The room is poorly ventilated, so quickly becomes musky, when the door and window are shut. The room has a small fan to try and mitigate this, but if the fan is off for any length of time, room quickly becomes musky. Wifi doesn't really work in the room either; have to go into kitchen to get the signal.\r\n\r\nQuite a noisy apartment too. Host's children were around, and making noise often. I.e. One night, two of them were running skateboards and scooters down the tiled corridor at 10 o'clock at night. You could hear the thunderous noise through the whole apartment (and I imagine on the floor below too). So, not ideal if you want to get an early night's sleep and hit the tourist sites very early.

He also provided a map and showed us the best places. A big warning though, if you're looking for a quiet place to go home to after site seeing, this is not the place. Nothing against the host, it was just the area that's right in the center of everything so it's so loud. The apartment downstairs had a huge party and the whole place was shaking until almost 1 in the morning. There is a window in the room right in the courtyard so everyone talking in other apartments echoes. If noise is not a concern, then this is a great place. It's right in the heart of a crazy shopping area and a 15 minute walk to the beach. Warning wifi and cell service is patchy, the kitchen is really the only place it works in.

If you are traveling with friends and want to be in the center of everything then it's the place to stay. However, we didn't have internet in the room, only in the kitchen, the toilet was smelly and the room is much smaller than looks. \nTwo of us didn't have blankets but empty bed sheets and it was cold at night. The people sharing the flat were very noisy and someone was doing some reconstruction in the room at night. \nOne of the beds has a very soft foam mattress which can be a big deal if you have back problems like me. \nOverall it's a cheap central place, good for low budget - youngsters' travel. \nWould not advise to take the room if you are with your family.

Check-in was a little hard to figure out as well, with lots of communication back and forth. The owner, Flo, apparently did not live there.

So sieht die Wohnung nicht aus. Viel kleiner, als auf den Bildern. Die Ausstattung ist für den Arsch, darauf gehe ich auch noch genauer ein. Der Küchenschrank, war eine Glasvitrine mit paar Gläsern, Tellern und Besteck. Das ist aber gar nicht sooo schlimm, nerviger fand ich es, dass die Ausrüstung zum Kochen miserabel war. Mehr als Nudeln kochen war nicht drinnen... mussten also fast immer draussen essen, das Geld was durch das billige Appartement gespart wurde, ist für das Essen zwischen durch draufgegangen... Waschen kann man seine Kleidung gleich um die Ecke des Appartements. Unser Zimmer hat sehr muffig gestunken, wir hatten zwar einen Ventilator, der allerdings kaum etwas gebracht hat. Es war regelmäßig eine Haushälterin da, die ihren Job auch vernünftig gemacht hat, allerdings war sie nur für Oberflächen zuständig. Das Appartement ist von Grund auf dreckig. In seinem eigenen Zimmer kann man nicht ohne Schuhe oder Hausschuhen herumlaufen, ohne die Füße dreckig zu machen, dasselbe gilt gilt für das Bad. Der Kühlschrank war absolut versifft, wer dort sein Essen gelagert hat, konnte damit rechnen, dass dir Kühlschrankflüssigkeit und Fruchtfliegen darauf zu finden waren. Erst nach dem ich den Host darauf angesprochen habe, (Tag 3) unseres Aufenthalts wollte er sich darum kümmern, Tag 11 von insgesamt 13 Tagen hatte der Host einen neuen Kühlschrank besorgt. Der Haushälterin zur Folge, sei der Kühlschrank schon sehr lange in diesem Zustand gewesen. Der Host war zwar immer zu Hause, da er ein Zimmer in dem Appartement hatte, welches er vermietet hatte. Allerdings kümmert er sich viel zu schwach um die Ausstattung seines Appartements und geht auf die Wünsche der Gäste nur mit Verzögerung ein. Als Beispiel dafür: wir hatten ein Zimmer für drei Personen, welches auch wirklich nur als Schlafraum dienen sollte, dass ansonsten keinen Raum da war, wäre nicht schlimm gewesen, da wir einen Schrank für unsere Kleidung im Flur bekommen, den dann allerdings andere Gäste bekommen haben, mit der Begründung ihr Zimmer sei kleiner als unseres. Der Unterschied war, das es ein 2-Bett-Zimmer war... Nach 5 Tagen hatten wir einen anderen Schrank bekommen. Dieser war einer für die man Kleiderbügel brauchte, die natürlich gefehlt haben... unverschämt ist daran, dass für gewöhnlich dir Gäste nicht länger als 3-4 Tage ein Zimmer mieten, der Host also mit Absicht keine neuen Möbel geholt hat. Das selbe gilt für den Kühlschrank. Der Ort hat Vor- und Nachteile. Es liegt mitten im Zentrum der la rambla. Absolut toll, auch der Strand ist nicht so weit weg, mit dem Bus ist man in 10 min da zu Fuß 45min. fand ich persönlich sehr angenehm, da man bei gutem Wetter viel spaziert ist. Abends ist es allerdings nicht so schön in dem gesamten Viertel Barrio Gotico, wo sich das Appartment befindet, wird man alle 10m von einem Dealer oder einer Prostituierten angesprochen, was auf Dauer echt nervt. Nachts verwandelt sich das Gebiet also zu einem Ghetto...dafür kann der Host jedoch nichts. Leider sind wir nicht wirklich fündig geworden, was gute Restaurants angeht...falls..."},{"_id":"286347567","date":{"$date":"2018-07-06T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10802909","reviewer_id":"79373458","reviewer_name":"Amina","comments":"Really central and super close to la rambas and other popular areas !"},{"_id":"289381206","date":{"$date":"2018-07-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10802909","reviewer_id":"182949384","reviewer_name":"Charlotte","comments":"Buen alojamiento"},{"_id":"296229127","date":{"$date":"2018-07-25T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10802909","reviewer_id":"182948981","reviewer_name":"George","comments":"Great location, right in the heart of Barcelona.

The location of the place is spectacular, the view is amazing (nestled inbetween so many skyscrapers) and getting in and out of the place is really easy! We had a bit of trouble checking-in, since we didn't have the apartment number in the information provided to us. That was not Tara's fault though.. When you come here, just make sure you get all of the neccessary info in advance from airbnb. The aparment was clean and well-kept and communication with Tara was easy and quick. She let us check out pretty late (3pm), which we really really appreciated! The only thing we didn't love about the place was that there sometimes was a bit of an odor coming out of the bathroom.. I'm pretty sure that isn't Tara's fault either though, it must be a problem with old plumbing. But there is a window in the shower, so it's very easy to just air-out the bathroom with the door closed!\nOver all we are very very happy with our stay at Tara's place and would definitely come again:)"},{"_id":"212716870","date":{"$date":"2017-11-19T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10816768","reviewer_id":"72782310","reviewer_name":"Soowon","comments":"good and valuable place with nice location"},{"_id":"213773432","date":{"$date":"2017-11-23T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10816768","reviewer_id":"7771827","reviewer_name":"James","comments":"Tara’s place is absolutely fabulous. \nShe also made it very easy foe us in terms of communicating super fast for any requests. \nLocation is great.

We felt safe and cozy, and the building was quiet at night for restful sleep. Tara was very easy to get in touch with and provided responses quickly. I loved the location—super walkable to great restaurants, the zoo, Victoria Peak, and lots of public transit—but beware, if it is your first time to HK island and you want to walk from the subway/ferry, (Hidden by Airbnb) Maps won’t show you the amazing escalators and walkways that will make getting there a breeze, and you might get stuck carting luggage up many flights of stairs (as we did).

The location is what makes this place special.  It is located 100 yards from the Central Escalators that allow you to get Central easily.  That is important in the heat when you don't want to hike up the hill. The escalators are also a great hub for small restaurants and shops.  It was easy to walk to international ex-pat cafes or local only dim sum places (helpful to have basic Chinese).

As someone who used to live in Hong Kong (and so happened to live in the exact building as this apartment for two years) i love the location - as do the many expats who live / work in Hong Kong. It is especially well suited to foreigners (as it is very English friendly)\nwanting easy access to good western food/friendly environment but still have easy access local flavors or sights. Besides the numerous restaurants and bars in soho, if you want to cook at home there is a supermarket down the street  as well as a Starbucks and a 24 hr McDonalds. \n\nTara is also a fantastic host, doing her best to accommodate our arrival times and answering questions quickly and promptly.

Everything you could need is on your doorstep. Fresh fruit and veggies from street stalls, bars, restaurants, hole-in-the-wall eateries, shops, art galleries, museums, Hong Kong park (and zoo), are all within a 5-minute walking radius. Go up the escalator to access the Peak walk/run (the queue for the tourist cable car is pretty close too). Before 10am, take the escalator down the hill to be in the heart of Central (after 10am the escalator changes direction and runs up the hill). Hong Kong and Central MTR stations take you to anywhere you want. Another 5 minute walk and you're at the ferries. Tara's place was very comfortable for our family - 2 adults, 2 teenagers. The beds were firm and comfy, the bathroom and kitchen were great, excellent lounge for gazing out the windows at the world passing by (but quiet too).

The place is exactly how described, the room is comfortable and both hosts are the nicest most helpful people ever!!I ended my stay early in a place in Wan Chai (cockroach infested) and Joanna and Candy were quick to respond to my request to book the next day. They have all that you need: linens, water, snacks, juice etc. and someone to clean twice a week. Their two cats are friendly and cute! I really loved Quarry Bay as well, quiet with some great restaurants/bars and a gym near by. Definitely recommend this place to others and will recommend to my friends visiting Hong Kong!!!!

If you once find this place, you will relalise how close it is from Soho, but getting here for the first time wasn't very easy for us. I stayed here with my husband and my brother's family and the place was spacious enough (considering its hongkong) for us all to hang around. You need to walk up to the 4th floor but wasn't a problme at all to us. \nWe had some issue about electricity but Melanie responded quickly and helped us sort out the problem. One thing we felt inconvenient was hot shower but we got used to it later. And, it was very considerate of Melanie to prepare three heaters for us. \nI highly recommend this place for a family or groups of 4-5 ppl and especially those who wish to enjoy the atmosphere of Soho area and lankwaifong. I and my husband went out for a drink every night and found awesome bars and restaurants.

The furniture are old, renovation are worn, doors are coming lose, toilet doors eroded from water damage, dirty spots around the house. Cleaning inventories and equipment placed in a messy manner. Renovation wise on the whole it looks good but can be seen it was done without much regards to quality; exposed wires and piping, holes in wall not filled.

It is a bit hard to find for first time and I am giving your instruction here: E2 exit of ShengWan MTR station, you will see a square call \"Grand Millennium square/COSCO plaza\", walk up and cross the XING, you will find a well decorated stair, walk up the stair(or if you have heavy luggage and hard to carry up, you may keep walking up the hill and turn right on 7-11 store, then turn right again you will see the blue logo laudry shop), on you left is a blue logo laundry shop, the entrance just right next to it, so is the keys. 地处九记牛腩和地铁“上环站E2出口”之间,第一次来的人不会很好找,从E2出来经过中远COSCO广场往上走,过了人行红绿灯就有一个扶手装有LED装饰灯的楼梯,走上去(不要怀疑)左手边有一个蓝色招牌的洗衣店,旁边那个门就是了,钥匙在门口的密码锁里｡如果行李太多不方便走楼梯,就继续往斜坡上面走,7-11便利店右拐往上再走一段右拐的后巷里就能看到洗衣店招牌｡九记牛腩就在旁边一个路口｡这个位置确实很正中,三房一厅有厨房厨具齐全,不过我们没煮吃的｡建议想深度游览港岛的游客和去参加展会的人住｡我们是来展会的,早餐在E2出口往西30米的茶餐厅解决了就出发展会,每天如此｡距离兰桂坊也不远,散步的速度10分钟可到｡"},{"_id":"338571382","date":{"$date":"2018-10-20T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10840938","reviewer_id":"178746503","reviewer_name":"Joshua","comments":"Thank you for your place!

It is just across the street from Columbia's historic campus and less than a block away from the beautiful and green Riverside Park, a great place for a relaxing stroll, jog or bike ride along the Hudson River. It's also walking distance from Harlem, Central Park, and the Upper West Side. The neighborhood is also home to Barnard College, Grant's Tomb, Riverside Church, The Cathedral of St. John the Divine, Morningside Park, and an assortment of great restaurants, cafes, diners, book shops, and stores and shops of every kind. Morningside Heights is simultaneously vibrant and low-key, an area that many say is one of the few remaining genuinely 'neighborly' neighborhoods in NYC - a great place to stay when visiting the city.","notes":"5% discount for stays of 1 week or more 10% discount for stays of 1 month or more 20% discount for stays of 3 months or more","transit":"The 1 train is just two blocks away and the 2/3 express trains are only 2 stops away; all of them quickly connect to Times Square where almost all the other subway lines stop too.

Not only was the place exactly what we needed but Paul is a genuinely nice, kind, interesting human being and it has been a pleasure to get to know him. We stayed as a couple for just over a month and miss it already. Paul showed us around the neighbourhood when we first got there and was easily contactable thereafter.\r\n\r\nPaul's place is a unique gem decorated with his quirky eye for colour, style and collectible treasures. It has a cozy well decked out living room, a bedroom with a closet and a comfortable bed, spacious bathroom and a nice, sunny, open-plan kitchen surrounded by windows. It is neat and well organised. There is cooling and heating in every room (plus fans), and the kitchen is well stocked with pots, pans, and other requirements along with a nice big fridge and freezer.  We found the place had everything we needed for a comfortable long-term stay.\r\n\r\nFor us, the location so close to three big parks (incl. Central Park), Columbia and Harlem, was just right. There are transport options aplenty: bikes up and down Riverside Park, the 1 MTA line two blocks away and frequent Broadway buses.  Paul kindly lent us his two bikes which was a fab way to get around the city. Being located on the border of UWS is great as it is a relatively quiet area to stay but the rest of Manhattan is readily accessible through the 1 line meaning we got the best of Manhattan action combined with good sleeping!

Paul's place is awesome! Great space and great location! I was in NYC for 2 weeks at Columbia and the location was just a few blocks away. I didn't want to deal with transit in the AM, although that would not have been a big issue anyway.  Plus, it's right off broadway (the broadway that has shows) so subways access was great. Since it's a college town, I felt super safe and there were minimal tourists and minimal bums also. A couple things to note: this is actually Paul's residence so there are some personal affects to be mindful of.  I really appreciated that though because I was able to tap into the Tylenol and bandaids in the medicine cabinet over the course of 2 weeks. Hey, anything can happen!  He was totally respectful of my privacy and wasn't popping in or out during my stay.

Paul, my host, hit it out of the park. The location is outstanding. Such a lovely upper west side block, across the street and around the corner from Columbia. I was visiting my son who is a student there. Even if Columbia wasn't your destination, Paul's apartment is one block from lovely Riverside Park and the Hudson River. Morningside park is a few blocks to the east. Central Park North and Cathedral Parkway are 5-10 minutes away. The 1 train stops 2-4 blocks away. The UWS is very gracious. The pace is less frenetic which is a nice thing at the end of a day of NYC touring. Yet the nearness of Columbia gives the neighborhood a youthful hip vibe. And Columbia's campus is outstanding; lovely and compact. I felt safe coming and going from Paul's building. The building was well maintained. The hallway outside his door wasn't dark and depressing. There is a laundry in the basement and a garbage chute in the hall on his floor. Paul's apartment is decorated with an artist's eye; the furniture, art, even the plates and skillets, were beautiful, colorful, special. The kitchen/sitting room was filled with light! Everything was in its place. My bedroom had a very big, comfortable bed. The bed linens were soft; the colors were muted and restful. There was plenty of drawer and closet space. The table lighting was exceptional. I had a lovely view of a church and Columbia outside my bedroom window. Paul was so kind to welcome me very early due to my 5a arrival into JFK on a red eye from SF. He was quickly responsive when I requested my stay. He met me and welcomed me into his home. He made me tea, fruit and nuts. He gave me plenty of towels and wash clothes. He gave me a shelf in the bathroom for my toiletries. I unpacked, showered (plenty of hot water), and headed out to my first meeting. Paul was lovely to talk to, yet respectful of my privacy. He welcomed both of my young adult children into his home. My daughter (who is graduating from NYU) cooked 2 breakfasts in Paul's kitchen. She so enjoyed his window seat in his kitchen. My son lingered and did schoolwork at the kitchen table. Paul's space was so much more gracious than a dorm room! Paul even printed out my boarding pass when I was out and about. He also printed 36 pages of work that I had completed while spending the day in the libraries at Columbia and the cafes near Columbia while my son wrote a paper. Making that personal connection with Paul enhanced my stay. But he was so quiet and gracious that guests who want to keep to themselves would also be comfortable.

Sijainti on täydellinen NY lomalle. Alakerrassa nukkuminen vaatii hyvät unenlahjat, koska ilmastointilaitteen kosteudeneroitin pitää aika kovaa meteliä. Asunnossa on kuitenkin todella hyvin tilaa ja nukkumapaikkoja 5-6 henkilölle vaikka alakerrassa ei kukaan nukkuisikaan. Myös Wi-Fi katkeili jatkuvasti, mutta olen tyytyväinen, että oli edes jonkinmoinen nettiyhteys. Miriamin yhteydenpito oli asiallista ja hyvää. Ohjeet avainten saamiseen tuli hyvissä ajoin ja olivat selkeät. Myös asunnossa oli selkeät ohjeet kaikkeen tarvittavaan. Kaiken kaikkiaan olemme erittäin tyytyväisiä tähän asuntoon ja majoittajaan.

Her home was well appointed with all the basic necessities one would need for cooking and relaxing when you needed a break from the city.  The apartment is on the most picturesque street of stunning brownstones and lovely old trees.  It it quiet and felt very safe and is conveniently located near many restaurants, coffee shops, grocery stores and namely, the lovely Fort Greene park which we visited almost daily with our four young children.  Close to many subway lines, Miriam's apartment was perfectly located for popping into Manhattan as well as getting around Brooklyn in general.  \nCheck in was seamless, Miriam was the perfect balance of attentive and easy to get in touch with without feeling like you were being \"watched\".  The apartment was very clean and had everything we needed and was very comfortable.  We met many neighbors and my children played with some of the neighborhood children on several occasions and have even made a pen pal.  \nThank you so much, we would love to stay there again in future travels.

Miriam is a really good host and easy to get in contact with if needed - for both questions and travel- och restaurant recommendations. Many different stations for metro in the surrounding makes travel easy and Fort Greene as a neighborhood is great and a good hub for exploring Williamsburg, Brooklyn Heights, Red Hook and other interesting parts of Brooklyn.

Our favorite was the Green Grape \u0026 Provisions, for wine, craft beer and fresh soups, etc.  Miriam was so helpful in giving us her \"spot\" on the street for one car and we were very lucky to find a 2nd spot on the street for our 2nd car.  There are rules around times you can park, but we arrived on Friday afternoon and stayed until Tuesday with no problems at all. There are garages in the surrounding area that do have spots available for longer stays if needed. The apartment itself is clean and comfortable, although we did not spend much time there.  The master with bathroom was nice, and the 2nd bedroom in the basement was fine, but be sure to understand it is the basement with furnace in the room and slightly steep stairs.

After long walks in Manhattan it was a pleasure going back home, because we really had the feeling of being at Home. We were 7 and we had all the space, 2 bathrooms was a must and a large opened kitchen which was fully equipped to spend good breakfast, lunch or dinner time. We didn’t have the opportunity to relax in the garden but it was charming and we believe that it must be so cool to have BBQ or jus rest. We discovered the neighborhood, just turn the quiet street the home is and you’ll get in Brooklyn, a slice of New York in a more relaxed atmosphere and authentic architecture. Nice restaurants, subways to go anywhere, groceries with fresh foods, it’s all around the corner. Few minutes from the apartment you can go to Barclays center and see NBA Brooklyn Nets, have shopping in Fulton \u0026 Jays streets, Fort Greene park  is a nice place, only 4 stations to reach Brooklyn Bridge and its unique view of Manhattan with the C train which is only 3 minutes from the apartment at walking distance,  Thanks to Miriam we had a wonderful stay in New York Brooklyn."},{"_id":"345653265","date":{"$date":"2018-11-05T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10857454","reviewer_id":"27491644","reviewer_name":"Lillian","comments":"Wonderful neighborhood and quick responses!"},{"_id":"347515043","date":{"$date":"2018-11-11T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10857454","reviewer_id":"200424940","reviewer_name":"Allison","comments":"Miriam is an amazing superhost!

The apartment is sizeable enough for 2 people and is a safe haven away from home after the chaos that Hong Kong often supplies!  Transport is close by, restaurants are in abundant supply, and the locals are usually helpful and happy if you are spending money.  The antique markets are a short walk away and there are some fantastic tea rooms just around the corner.  Loved the area and the apartment.

There are tons of cute cafes, restaurants, and shops a stone throw’s away. Be aware though that Sheung wan is extremely hilly, with lots of stairs. The MTR station is very close — a straight walk down Hilier st, which is right in front of the apt. No hills or stairs on this walk! I should also say that cabs are very easy to find in front of the apt, and quite cheap and reliable. Cabbies often don’t speak English but we showed our destination on (Hidden by Airbnb) maps, and this worked great every time. \n\nThe apt itself was small by our Wisconsin standards but probably quite large by HK standards. It was clean and cozy and perfectly fine. It was surprisingly quiet for being in such a bustling neighborhood. The bathroom and kitchen were small (but we didn’t need to cook or even shop for groceries considering all the amazing food options nearby) and there was little storage for our stuff. But for two people it was great and we had such a wonderful time there. Nothing but lovely memories. \n\nMaria missed our initial Airbnb request because she was traveling, but once we got a hold of her she was super responsive and helpful. \n\nWe had such a happy stay in HK.

Overall, it was like spending a weekend at a friend's place.  The neighborhood was quite busy with people and shops until late into the night, but the room was quiet, clean and comfortable.  I slept like a baby.  I would only suggest that you confirm your check in and check out times with them in advance so as to avoid any confusion.

De modo geral a nossa experiência foi tranquila e agradável. A Karen e o Joshua foram bastante receptivos e atenciosos conosco, sempre nos perguntavam se estávamos bem,  se precisávamos de alguma coisa, se estávamos curtindo a cidade e etc. Eles dão total liberdade para entrada e saída do apartamento em qualquer horário e nos entregaram as chaves logo que chegamos. Sempre saíamos pela manhã e chegávamos de madrugada, circulávamos pelo corredor e utilizávamos o banheiro e nunca tivemos nenhum problema, mesmo porque tomávamos cuidado. O quarto é pequeno, a cama é muito boa, tínhamos travesseiros, cobertas e espaço no armário. A diferença entre as fotos que vemos no anúncio e o apartamento de modo geral é grande, pois existem muito mais móveis e objetos em vários lugares, mas o quarto é exatamente igual, quentinho e aconchegante. As crianças são lindas e comunicativas. Muito fofas!\r\nO bairro é muito legal também, tem mercadinhos, lojinhas de conveniências, farmácia e para os que arriscam, algumas opções para comer. Fica ao lado do metrô (2 and 5 trains), e quando eu digo ao lado, são apenas 3 minutos caminhando do apartamento e 30 minutos de Manhattan (Durante o dia. De madrugada é um pouco mais). Excelente localização! \r\nCom certeza repetiríamos a experiência! Esperamos voltar muito em breve e adoraríamos que eles nos recebessem. \r\n\r\nThank you, folks! You are really especial to us!

The room was very comfortable, and I thought it was plenty of space for one person with a few bags. The rest of the apartment is nice and comfy as well, and I appreciated that I was made to feel welcome to use the common areas when I was around. The apartment has only one bathroom but I never felt like there were any conflicts with getting time in the shower or anything. Location is fantastic--there's a subway station literally just round the corner and I found it very quick and easy to get into Manhattan every day. I honestly never felt all that uncomfortable with the neighborhood, as other reviews mentioned, but I guess that kind of thing is relative.\r\n\r\nOn top of all this, it really has to be said that this is just the nicest family. Karen and Joshua are so friendly and also really interesting people. I tend to be a little shy of strangers and sometimes find it stressful staying in a room in the home of a family I don't know, but Karen and Joshua never made me feel like I was intruding, and I had some really enjoyable conversations with them. Their two kids are also super cute and very precocious. \r\n\r\nI would absolutely recommend staying here, and would happily stay here again myself on any future visit to the area.

The communication beforehand and also during my stay was just excellent! Unfortunately I didn't get to meet Karen in person as she was out of town during my stay but Joshua looked after my wellbeing, making sure I was fine, recommending restaurants and giving all the useful tips you might need when staying in New York! Their kids were just adorable and \"JJ\" the cat got loads of extra cuddles from me :-) Karen and Joshua's home is exactly as described: 40-45mins by Subway into Manhattan (Midtown: Times Square, Theatre District ...), their place being actually located right in the 'heart of Brooklyn' gave me sort of a suburban feeling with its own vibes and even tranquillity as I barely heard any street noise at all ... waking up to birds singing in the trees and someone playing a piano lovingly in the distance is quite unusual in a City like New York, so that was a real treat during my stay!!! The bed was extremely comfortable, I overslept not only once during my eight-day-stay with them and having the luxury of 'my very own little fridge' in my room was definitely another Highlight!!! Travelling to and from Manhattan by Subway is really easy and I always felt safe ... even late at night or at 4am in the morning hours walking home all by myself, no need to feel unsafe at all! The Subway Station is located right around the corner (3min walk from Karen and Joshua's home!) and has also elevators which comes in handy when you're carrying heavy luggage!

When we arrived we buzzed and called both Karen and Josh and banged on the door, but it ended up being an hour before we heard back from them and were let in. Karen was at work which we knew, but it turns out Josh was inside sleeping and didn't hear our repetitive knocks or his phone going off.\n\nAfter we finally got settled everything was fine. Karen seems nice, didn't interact with Josh as much. The apartment is just a block from the 2 and 5 trains which go right into Manhattan in 20-30 minutes. Not a great neighborhood but we didn't plan on spending time there anyway. The apartment had everything we needed. The feature of the bed pulling out to a queen is nice and convenient, though there's not much more space in the room when it is out. There was a bit of just cosmetic mold in the shower.\n\nFor the price the stay was worth it.

Sadly I didn't get to meet her and family during my short stay, but I was always extremely welcomed! Karen's awesome friend Rachel (and I truly mean awesome) did everything to keep the place perfect and help me with anything I needed! Communicating with them is very smooth. The place is very cozy, clean and quiet. I definitely recommend it if you would like to explore Brooklyn for it's dynamic life. It is located very close to a subway station and bus stop, with many pharmacies stores and shops around (try the local Nostrand Donut Shop for breakfast and donuts!). Their cat JJ is adorable and unlike most other cats, tends to keep to himself (so if you're not used to cats, I still recommend this place). PS. He loves cuddle time on the couch :) Thank you Karen, family, and especially Rachel for having me!

You don't get to meet host often so I enjoyed my privacy. If there are no other Airbnb guests, you can enjoy the whole place with a fancy kitchen and washroom. Just to keep you company there will be a cat always in the living room. \nThe only issue I had was the parking. You will find a spot 4 blocks away after spending an hour during busy hours. I'll recommend not to keep a car but that is the problem with all of the Brooklyn.  My favorite thing was the area around.

The room is a little small, but since this is New York, that's to be expected (and hopefully you aren't spending too much time in your room anyway). It should be mentioned you'll be living with Karen and Joshua's family; if you are someone who just wants a quiet place where you don't have to talk to anyone else, this might not be the home for you. If however, you enjoy interacting with others and having interesting conversations then this is the place for you.

My sons were amazed to hear kookaburras and have a couple of parakeets come down to join us on the terrace at breakfast.  Susie the owner was very straightforward to deal with and added some really thoughtful touches to welcome us (Xmas tree, hamper, list of best cafés and restaurants in the village).

La zona è abbastanza tranquilla, si rientrava anche a sera tardi ma non abbiamo avuto nessun problema.

It is pretty good size for three people. My parents slept on the bed and I slept on the couch. I am 180 cm (5' 11'') and fit on the couch and it was pretty comfortable.\r\nWhen we arrived Michelle's house she greeted us right away, took her time to explain how to commute, where to eat and what to do in the city. \r\nThe location of house is pretty good. It takes 20-30 min with metro to Manhattan downtown, depends on which line you use. You can also take the metro from JFK, otherwise the cab costs  around $50. In the house everything was clean and neat. She also provided us towels for shower etc. Besides that, whenever I texted to Michelle she responded in timely manner, which made everything easier.\r\nHonestly, our overall experience was much better than I expected.  Me and my family had a very good time in Michelle's house and NY. If one day I go back to NY, I know where I should stay. \r\n"},{"_id":"9282577","date":{"$date":"2013-12-18T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1092760","reviewer_id":"903552","reviewer_name":"Annette","comments":"We spent a wonderful week at Michelle's place.

This was my first airbnb experience and I enjoyed it a lot. Her service is much better than anything you would get at a hotel for a much better price. She gave us a recommendation on where to get breakfast that turned out great. The place is very clean and neatly decorated. It's literally right off the subway station, so that's a huge plus. We also met her mother, who is a fascinating woman. I highly recommend her place, if you are looking to visit the area.  \r\n-- Later Edit:\r\nI should mention that her internet is very fast. I don't know what ISP she uses, but it was a joy to go back to a temporary accommodation and know that you are well connected while traveling. I'm not sure of the exact setup, but it appeared that we had a separate modem and router just for us. This was a huge relief. Michelle had the SSID and password printed and ready for guests, so even if you forget to ask, you would still find them in the apartment. Overall, things were very well thought out before hand and Michelle was very proactive with tiny details like this that make all the difference. This was very surprising to me knowing that I'm dealing with an individual and not a company.

La proximité avec une station de métro est un plus ainsi que celle de l'épicerie permettant de faire les petites courses pour les repas pris au gite. Michelle est extrêmement accueillante et serviable. \r\nl'appartement est simple et très propres. 4 vrai lits confortables. \r\n==)négatifs:\r\nbien que situé dans un quartier + calme, la chambre donne sur la rue, et les nuits peuvent être difficiles pour les oreilles sensibles. le métro qui passe dessous est audible, tout comme les avions. mais à New York , il est difficile de trouver une endroit très calme. NEW YORK reste un environnement urbain et donc globalement bruyant, autant en avoir conscience. \r\nPour une famille de 4, les lits enfants sont dans la pièce qui sert de coin jour. Une table et chaises pliantes nécessitent d'être pliés  pour installer le 4ième lit et inversement, plier le lit pour prendre les repas. Pour les français que nous sommes, la table est aussi importante que le lit. ça peut être un problème. \r\nPeu de vaisselle ( verres en plastique) ce qui est un peu dommage mais ça reste un détail.\r\nMais quand on vient à New York, ce n'est pas pour une ballade gastronomique. Nous recommandons vraiment cette adresse. Très bon compromis.\r\nLa cours arrière sera appréciable pour les périodes + douces.\r\n\r\nEnglish comments:\r\nJust returned from NYC where we stayed with our 2 teenagers in Michelle's appartement. We are really delighted .\r\n\r\n==)positives:\r\nGood compromise quality / price ratio . Proximity to a metro station is a must as well as with the grocery store allowing some errands for meals at the appartement. really practical, opened until 21h. Michelle is extremely friendly and helpful.\r\nthe appartment is simple but  very clean with 4 real comfortable beds.\r\n\r\n==)negatives:\r\nAlthough located in a quiet neighborhood, the parent room is overlooking the street, and the nights can be difficult for sensitive ears. Subway is audible,as well as cars \u0026 trucks in the street. But to moderate this aspect,  in New York, it's difficult to find a quiet place because it remains a generally noisy urban environment as knowledge.\r\nFor a family of 4, children beds are in the main room. A table and chairs need to be folded to open beds and vice versa, folding bed for meals. it could be a problem.\r\nVery few dishes ( plastic glasses ) which could be improved but it's still a detail.\r\n\r\nBut when we come to visit New York, it is not for gastronomic ballad, and it's important  to find a confortable \u0026 clean area. The backyard could be pleasant when the weather allows to use it. Unfortunatelly for us it's was too cold begining of march.\r\nWe really recommend this address.\r\nMany thanks to Michelle.\r\n\r\nPascale et Yann."},{"_id":"11260293","date":{"$date":"2014-03-27T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1092760","reviewer_id":"11456381","reviewer_name":"Sara","comments":"Very nice apartment, comfortable beds, and felt very safe in the neighborhood.

Vi er 2 voksne og tre store børn. Lejligheden var ren og pæn, med alle de ting en familie har brug for. Godt lille køkken, hvor vi hver dag kunne lave morgenmad, kaffe og te. Dertil en rigtig hyggelig gårdhave, hvor man kan slappe af efter en hektisk dag på Manhattan. Kvarteret hvor lejligheden ligger i er et beboelseskvarter, med masser af butikker, restauranter, skoler og kirker. Et levende område, men meget trygt og vi følte os meget sikre når vi gik rundt. Vi var glade for, at vi valgte at bo i Brooklyn, for der er meget at se og opleve i området. Michelles lejlighed ligger kun 30 meter fra en subway, og det er enkelt at finde til Manhattan eller andre steder på Brooklyn. Vores fly var forsinket, og vi ankom først kl. 01 til lejligheden, men Michelle var meget omtænksom og havde lagt vand og juice i køleskabet, og sørget for at der var kaffe. Så kunne vi lige klare os til næste morgen, hvor vi handlede ind i supermarkedet - tak for det Michelle.\r\n\r\nI det hele taget gjorde Michelle det nemt at være turist i New York. Hun var tilgængelig for vores spørgsmål og da vi skulle hjem, bestilte hun en taxa til os.

That being said, DO NOT turn the water just to hot to wash your hands, you will get burnt. Our flight got in late at night and when we arrived, it smelled like a bug bomb was let off in the apartment. We aired it out every day and it took almost 3 days for the odor to dissipate. Michelle said it was cleaners, I am still unsure. My wife and I both got a headache from the fumes the first night.  The bed in the photo is a misrepresentation, the mattress was a sleep number set to the hardest setting with no remote to adjust it, we slept on the couch/daybed. The pillows were cheap and nearly unusable, bring your own. The sheets were also cheap, hospital quality. There are 14 signs in the apartment and on the door to the back telling you what you are and aren't allowed to do. We had to call to have the heat turned on when it was about 40 degrees in the space and then the radiators are quite noisy and right near the bed.\r\n\r\n45 minute commute on the subway to get to mid-town Manhattan. I would not stay there again, we never felt really comfortable.

She had stocked the fridge with essentials like juice, eggs, butter and jam, and the cupboards also had a lot of basics like tea, coffee, pasta etc. Likewise there was plenty of soap, toilet paper, shampoo and body wash in the bathroom, none of which we had ever seen in previous Air BnB apartments. Little touches like this really make a difference if you've ever forgotten your own, or if you don't have a lot of time to spend shopping.\n\nFor a couple, the apartment is spacious, warm, comfortable and extremely close to a subway station with supermarkets and delicatessens in easy walking distance. It's very easy to get into Manhattan within about 40 minutes.\n\nMichelle was extremely accommodating, had lots of good tips about the local area and the rest of NYC, and the next time we are in NYC, I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.

Michelle also has a baby's portable cot so the unit can easily accommodate 2 adults and 2 small children. \r\nHeating is great which is important in the brutal NY winter. \r\nKitchen amenities are also good if you want to prepare your own meals.

We were able to have the table with the four chairs up the whole time we were there and managed to move around freely. We definitely took advantage of the kitchen, we cooked every morning. The apartment is located half a block down from the G line which was great since we took the train everywhere. She gave us a list of recommendations, make sure you go to the Black Swan. They have great food and beers. The apartment has central heating so make sure to take a tank top because it is warm at night. We all overpacked because we thought the apartment might of been too cold because of the snow but it was nice and toasty. We did see snow fall down and it was nice to have the patio in the back to make snow angels. Michelle is extremely attentive and if you really want to enjoy New York, stay out in Brooklyn.

Everything's just as described and all the local information we needed was provided for us. A great coffee shop nearby for breakfast, and one of the best doughnuts we've ever tasted from a bakery!\nAs we were spending most of our time in Manhattan, ease of transport was important. No problem. It only took about half an hour to get downtown.\nSo, all in all a great stay. One small criticism (which we did talk to Michelle about) is the heating. It's an old system and when it's on it was really hot and a bit noisy. Any adjustments Michelle has to make from her part of the house, which she was always happy to do but did mean messaging or phoning. \nThanks Michelle!"},{"_id":"29479065","date":{"$date":"2015-04-08T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1092760","reviewer_id":"22761467","reviewer_name":"Gisa","comments":"Wir haben uns in der Wohnung sehr wohl gefühlt.

There's a donut place nearby called \"dough\" and it was a fantastic plus - we went there for breakfast every morning when we stayed at Michelle's. Overall, it was a great experience.

The apartment was impecable clean and it had everything we needed (great heating, comfortable beds, fresh towels, extra blankets, complete bathroom, very equiped kitchen). What we enjoyed the most about the apartment was that it worked as a little house where all of us could have our own space and every corner felt like home. It was clear to us that Michelle takes good care of the place in a personal way and that makes it very cozy.\nAs a host, Michelle was kind, clear, organised, helpful and flexible, and payed attention to our needs along all our stay.\nThe neighbourhood was safe, well connected (the G subway line takes you everywhere in Brooklyn and makes it easy to go to Manhattan; there are two stations less than 100 meters away) and has small shops, restaurants and supermarkets. \nWe loved Brooklyn and strongly recommend visitors to take the time to see it. It has a lot to offer and let you have a rest from crowded Manhattan.\nMichelle's apartment was not only a place to have a good night sleep, but also a place where we enjoyed spending time. We would definitely come back!"},{"_id":"68526770","date":{"$date":"2016-04-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1092760","reviewer_id":"63512092","reviewer_name":"Heiko","comments":"Die Unterkunft entspricht der Beschreibung.

Die Unterkunft von Michelle ist wirklich super süß eingerichtet, sehr detailreich und sie hat an viele Kleinigkeiten gedacht (wir kamen z.B. abends an, sodass sie uns für den kommenden Tag Getränke und Bagels bereitstellte). Es fehlte an nichts in dem Apartment, sie war jederzeit erreichbar, wenn wir eine Frage hatten und super nett und hilfsbereit. Einziges kleines Manko ist die laute Ubahn, die man vor allem nachts unter der Wohnung fahren hört, aber wir hatten damit nicht so ein großes Problem. Im Gegenteil: die gute Anbindung hat uns sehr viel Zeit gespart und wir konnten alles extrem gut und recht schnell erreichen (Metro ist nur 2Min zu Fuß entfernt von dem Apartment). Wir entschieden uns für Brooklyn, weil wir Manhattan schlichtweg nicht bezahlen \"wollten\", aber auch Brooklyn hat seinen eigenen Charme, den wir extrem cool fanden! Wer also eine Unterkunft sucht, die von der Lage her gut, sehr sauber ist und Wert auf einen netten Gastgeber legt, ist bei Michelle genau richtig aufgehoben! Sehr zu empfehlen.

Definitely a great addition to the Airbnb community.\n\nThe apartment is situated near a subway station in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighbourhood, of which it does become apparent quickly enough that it has had a rocky past, but me and my girlfriend haven't felt unsafe for a single second.\n\nSome practical things that could be handy to know...\n\n* If you're used to silence when you go to sleep, you may experience some difficulties here. We haven't heard any construction going on during our week in New York City, but traffic does go on until pretty late, and you'll hear it a bit when a subway train is passing by. Luckily the ear plugs Michelle has provided help well, and the bed is very comfortable.\n\n* Unrelated to the apartment, but still something I'd like to share for possible future guests to keep into consideration; Brooklyn doesn't have an awful lot of Walmart like supermarkets. There are plenty of delis, but those usually don't have a wide array of products, especially when you prefer to eat healthy. So you'll basically have to be in Manhattan for the higher end supermarkets, and those tend to be very pricey, and you're more or less scr*wed if you're a vegetarian/vegan. Guess you'll have to visit specialty shops for that.\n\n* When it's warm enough, do use that garden. :)"},{"_id":"151006892","date":{"$date":"2017-05-10T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1092760","reviewer_id":"21793715","reviewer_name":"Pnina","comments":"To our opinion Michelle fulfills the vision of Airbnb of bringing people together.\nThe moment you walk in and meet her you feel home, reliability, caring and tons of good will.

When I got there, I was surprised to see that the owner had split the house into two rentals – an upstairs unit and a downstairs unit – and had relegated to only the upstairs unit: two bedrooms, a mini kitchen (small modified entry hallway), with NO large kitchen, no dining room whatsoever, no washer, dryer, back yard or hot tub.\r\n\r\nThe half of the house that we had access to was very nice. Light wood floors with plenty of closet storage, two bathrooms, and a mini kitchen. There were two TVs (one had Netflix only while the other had a few stations). There are four beds – the two bedroom beds were nice and comfy whereas the two living area “beds” (couch/beds) were like slightly cushioned wood planks. My daughter tried sleeping there the first night and said never again. The air conditioner worked very well. And the view from the unit was spectacular. The house is right on the lake (Enchanted Lake) and sunrises were beautiful.\r\n\r\nThe house is in Kailua, a sleepy little town on the east side of Oahu. The Kailua beach is only minutes away and is one of the nicest beaches on Oahu. There was no boogie board and no beach towels provided by the owner but Target was only a few minutes away. \r\n\r\nSound was an issue. Because of the way the house was divided, we could hear every word our “neighbors” were saying. In our case, the neighbors were super loud and didn’t sleep until 2-3 am every night.\r\n\r\nThe owner said we could use the washer and dryer in the garage but that we’d have to literally enter the other renter’s unit and walk through their dining room (what should have been our dining room) to get to the garage. We didn’t feel comfortable with that so we didn’t.\r\n\r\nThere was no hot tub on the property.\r\n\r\nDespite getting only half the house, we made the most of our Hawaii adventure and had a wonderful time. \r\n"},{"_id":"85142672","date":{"$date":"2016-07-10T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10932304","reviewer_id":"14981166","reviewer_name":"Dione \u0026 Channell","comments":"This is a great locations for adults looking for a party location in beautiful Kailua. Not ideal for families. Kailua is the ideal location for families! Kailua Beach is the most beautiful beach on the island with white soft sand and light waves. I loved the town and the location of the bond was close to town, Bellows AFB beaches, the Sandy Beach breathtaking coastline and Hanauma Bay. The house was very clean and neat. The decor was relaxing and the kitchen was well stocked. However this home is NOT ideal for families. There is not a dining area (table) for meals, there is not a backyard(as it is for the lower unit), and there is not direct access to laundry (which is coin operated). Tom was very pleasant and responsive via text or Airbnb messaging. Regretfully, he never met with us during our 13 day visit. He was not there to greet us are our arrival or departure. That made things difficult because we were very surprised to learn that the washer and dryer was not in our unit. We had to enter the kitchen of the downstairs unit to access the garage to do laundry. Unfortunately, the washer water emptied in the utility sink which overflowed on the floor due to a malfunction in the plumbing. This happen on day 3 and never was fixed during our 13 day stay. We were forced to use a local laundry mat.This was very inconvenient because we selected this home for this amenity as we were a family of 8 on a 13-day vacation. We didn't have a linen set for s second couch pullout. I requested it the first night and never received it. We made due by stealing pieces from other beds. The advertising for the home is misleading. It causes one to believe that the backyard is for this unit, there is a dining area, and that laundry is an amenity for this unit. Rather, the backyard is for the lower unit whose front door is the entryway to the backyard. The lower unit is set up as a bachelor pad and is rented by large groups of adults looking for a good time in Hawaii. The lanai is set up with 3 indoor couches, numerous misfit dining chairs, 2 lounge chairs, and a patio set for 4. This set up is not as the picture shows which is a low key back lanai with one patio set. There was lots of drinking and loud partying into late hours of the evening. This was not ideal for my family which included young children and an infant. I would like to not that Tom was very responsive at our complaint for loud noise past 11pm but this did not eliminate the loud partying on future nights. Lastly, Tom did not inform us that there would be roof work being done to install solar panels beginning at (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) for 4 days. No sleeping in those days on our vacation!

The fun is catch and realse :) The area is very safe and I had the chance to speak with the residents near b,y very friendly and informative about the area. We never used the laundry but it is easily accessible for both units you no longer have to go through the other home, it has its own enclosure. Bring your own beach towels as they are not provided but not a big deal since target is 5 minute drive! There are many restaurants near by and shopping centers so its a huge bonus. There's a Costco about 20 minutes away its worth the drive, not only do you save money but the view is beautiful ! The host Tom was very nice and accommodating.

Both of us were from out of state (CA and FL) and attending a wedding nearby.  The location of the house was about perfect for us, being both close to where the wedding was as well as close to town and a little bit of local nightlife (we were about to walk home from Kailua in about 20-25 minutes one night after going out). Kailua is a decent city about a 5 min drive away with pretty much everything you'll need close to you (Target, Safeway, Wholefoods, shopping, restaurants, and some decent little dive bars). \r\n\r\nMy only complaint about this place was really just a simple mix up with the initial access into the property. The day before I arrived I was given an access code to the front door. When I arrived I used the code given and quickly realized after multiple attempts that the code was not the right code. After about 30 mins of trying to contact the owner I finally got a response to come reset the code. Unfortunately he was at work so his wife was going to have to come do it. Long story short, it took 3 hours after his initial response before his wife was able to make it over to reset it. From the moment I got there I had to wait about 3.5 hours to actually get into the house, which isn't the most fun to do when trying to get changed in clothes that are more suited for the heat and humidity (jeans and long sleeve shirt may be appropriate for the airport I departed from, but not for flying into Honolulu). So about 3.5 hours of being sweaty and miserable trying to kill time in town before being able to change.\r\n\r\nThat being said, the rest of the property was very clean, decently furnished, and the quality of the house and amenities is what I would consider to be average for the houses in the area, which is to say that yes it was a nice place. \r\n\r\nI give the house 4 stars out of 5 because of the mixup of the entry access code and long response time. Otherwise I would probably say closer to 4.5 stars as far as how the property's profile vs reality was. I would recommend this property to a friend and I would consider staying here again."},{"_id":"95717157","date":{"$date":"2016-08-20T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10932304","reviewer_id":"45046140","reviewer_name":"都子","comments":"ｶｲﾙｱの町から車で3分位ととても利便性のいい場所です｡\n一軒家の2階部分の貸し切りでした｡最初入り方が分からなくて何度もお仕事中のTomさんに電話を描けてしまいました｡丁寧に説明してくれるのですが､私の英語力が乏しくて分かりませんでした｡\nすると､何と❗わざわざ40分かけてTomさんのお父さんが家まで来てくれました｡本当にお世話になりました｡\n夏なのでｴｱｺﾝがないと生きていけない!とこの物件を選びしたが､実際は風通しも良くて窓を開けてると充分快適です｡"},{"_id":"123053299","date":{"$date":"2016-12-27T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10932304","reviewer_id":"9040965","reviewer_name":"Paul","comments":"Tom was a terrific host.

Tom was incredibly easy to work with and very responsive to any questions we had! The location of the home was perfect for what we needed. Close enough to Kailua's center to drive there in less than 5 minutes. Would probably be a 15 minute walk and quick bike ride. The house is on Enchanted Lake and that was both a pro and con. The view was great, the cool air flow coming across the lake helped keep the house comfortable, and we saw lots of ducks/birds. The con was that it got a little smelly but that's no fault of Tom's obviously. One bummer was that unit is on the 2nd floor of what was obviously a single family home. So as an upstairs guest there is no access to the backyard or the water front. The property is also located right on a semi-busy road so there was traffic and noise throughout the day and night. The road was convenient though. Quick access to Hamakua and to Kalanianaole hwy. The property had two large bedrooms, both with comfortable King sized Temperpedic mattresses. The bedding was comfortable as well. Each bedroom, as well as the living room, had air conditioning units. We used the bedroom units at night only, and were very comfortable and it drowned out the noise from the street (when there was noise). The overall cleanliness of the house was adequate but not impressive. It wasn't dirty but there were remnants of the last tenants - like hair. It wasn't unmanageable but not fun to deal with. One shower was pretty molded but we didn't even use that shower so it wasnt a problem. Of course we came across ants in the bathrooms but it didn't bother us a bit. As former residents of Kailua, we knew that ants are just part of the territory. We simply made sure to keep food in air tight containers or in the fridge. One con for us was that the temperature of the water in the showers was always hot. No matter how cold we turned the dial (all the way) the water was hot. This was not the case for the sinks though. This made it difficult for us to bathe our two small children, but we made it work by adding cold water from the sink to the bath. One different thing about the property is that the very small kitchen is located downstairs while the rest of the unit is upstairs. It wasn't a problem for us because we ate most of our meals at a friend's house or out. There are kitchenware provided but for us it seemed difficult to cook. The kitchen also is right outside of a bedroom for a downstairs guest. Sound proofing between the two units in this area could be improved. I know that we were sometimes bothered by the noisy guests coming in late, or hanging out in the..."},{"_id":"175814131","date":{"$date":"2017-07-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10932304","reviewer_id":"59894121","reviewer_name":"Dylan","comments":"Tom was a very good host!

It was perfect after a long flight. It is in a perfect area close to the beach and restaurants. We walked to the beach everyday and learned to surf with Jon free. Jon also helped us rent a car for 2 days to explore the north and east shores of the island. He found a special for 9.99 per day at enterprise. We were given free parking in the building which was perfect after a day exploring and adventures. Jon knows the island very well and directed us to the best restaurants and activities. We walked to the food pantry bought some light groceries. Breakfast: Eggs fresh baked bread bacon and fresh oj to make perfect breakfasts in bed better than any room service at a fraction of the cost. Lunch sandwiches. We also walked to Aloha kitchen for some lobster eggs benedict. Amazing and under 15 dollars. We also saved money because most of the activities suggested were free or very inexpensive.

Spacious with a nice kitchen and decently sized bathroom. Jon was even generous enough to spend some time with me to show all the good places to eat and explore near Waikiki.

Although our destination was the Big Island, we had to spend a night in Honolulu. Given that all hotels were in excess of $300 a night and we just needed to kill about 18 hours in Honolulu, we thought of giving Airbnb a shot for the first time. \r\n\r\nThis is when we came across Jon's listing. From the very beginning, Jon was incredibly friendly and courteous even before we departed Toronto. He would constantly stay in touch always keen to be of assistance in any way. He was nice enough to advise us that a cab from the airport to his place would cost $55 one way. He offered to pick us up at a one way cost of $29! Just as promised, he did exactly that, was already at the airport when we landed. Jon is an incredibly well rounded guy. Based on his vast travel experiences and professional background, we struck up a great rapport and friendship over some great conversation on the drive home. \r\n\r\nJon's place is located in the heart of downtown Honolulu, a walking distance from all the hot spots. This worked out very well for us given that we only had about 6 hours the following morning to explore the city before our flight to the Big Island. The unit itself is extremely clean and comfortable. Although not requested or required, Jon ensured he had kept beach towels/chairs, snorkeling gear, toiletries, sun screen and some snacks/water for us should we decide to explore the beach. The bed was very comfortable and the studio apartment also has a kitchen and large bathroom. We were very comfortable in Jon's unit and encourage you to give Jon an opportunity to be your host. \r\n\r\nThe best part of our short stay in Honolulu is the 'value add' Jon provides. When we arrived at his place around 10pm, he stayed back and assisted us plan our morning and afternoon in Honolulu with the aim of being able to see the most we can in our limited time. At 7am, he gave us an hour of his time and drove us around some really neat spots: Waikiki Beach areas, shopping district, Magic Island and then dropped us to Diamond Head where we did the Hike to the top. He suggested a great place for breakfast (Aloha Kitchen) where we had a lovely breakfast after the hike. At 2pm, he arranged for a ride to the airport for us at the same rate of $29. \r\n\r\nI only wish we had more time with Jon. A person who truly embodies the culture of Hawaii: generosity, kindness and always giving with a smile. Jon is your gateway to Honolulu having lived there for ages! We could not have asked for a better first Honolulu and Airbnb experience. We made a great friend in Jon, and will always remain in touch and be back to see him and his family soon!

Incredible First-Time AirBNB Experience!\r\n\r\nWe were so nervous using AirBNB for the first time, we did not know what to expect. JON was THE REASON we went ahead and booked our first stay. Reading his reviews, person after person kept mentioning his hospitality in many different ways - and he definitely is THE MOST HOSPITABLE person I have ever met. Especially in over 15 years of my own vocation that is known for hospitality.\r\n\r\nDays before we arrived we were in communication with Jon in setting up our arrival. We had o stay at a hotel for the first half of our trip that was for business, but when it was vacation time we hopped on over to Jon's place that was a short distance away. Jon came and picked our baggage up earlier in the day so we could wrap our meetings and be checked out of our hotel and not have to drag luggage all around. Even in our stay in our hotel, Jon was answering our questions about the area and giving GREAT advice.\r\n\r\nTotally enjoyed Jon's place. It was a one room studio in an apartment complex that is only 3 stories tall. It was a quiet neighborhood and the main road was a 1 minute walk away. We walked everywhere in Downtown Waikiki and to the Ala Moana Mall. The beach and Hilton Lagoon was a 5 minute walk.\r\n\r\nAll the food recommendations were excellent in taste and easy on the budget. Real places from real locals. Jon helped us plan our trips to the North Shore and other famous spots. He provided everything we needed to have a great time without being charged extra - Beach Towels, Shade Umbrella, beach chairs, Inner tubes, Snorkel Gear. He offered to take us out surfing but we were just so darn busy seeing everything else.\r\n\r\nJon's place was great for our needs. We thought we were going to cook more, but just had snacks and breakfast we kept in the fridge. Jon surprised one day with fresh local fruit :-) Also, we are coffee addicts and wanted to brew our own even though local and national chain coffee shops were a short walk away so Jon went out of his way and brought over a coffee maker for us!!! We had to return the favor just a little bit, so we got him 2 Hawaiian mugs for the next guests ;-)\r\n\r\nAnd oh I want to buy the same bed he has! That thing was HUGE and SO COMFORTABLE! My back thanks you!\r\n\r\nThe kindness and generosity were top notch. We hope to return to Ohau again, and if we do, we will definitely look up Jon's place for availability. Jon gus a real sense of Ohana.\r\n\r\nJon, Mahalo Nui Lao!"},{"_id":"78712115","date":{"$date":"2016-06-08T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10948197","reviewer_id":"51520757","reviewer_name":"Kimberly","comments":"Everything was great."},{"_id":"79186714","date":{"$date":"2016-06-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10948197","reviewer_id":"60272558","reviewer_name":"Anna","comments":"Jon is the perfect host, gav us s many tips on where to eat, what to see, where to go shop, snorkel and more... even gave us surf board lessons!

Everything was waiting for us when we arrived after a day of adventure.  We felt very secure and safe in our room, which is located near everything we wanted to do.  This is a prime location nestled in a quaint neighborhood surrounded by big hotels and condos.  It is near the bus stop, Uber drivers and transport services can easily find you and you can easily grab a taxi if that is your need.  I highly recommend this location to anyone who plans on exploring Waikiki Beach and nearby attractions.  The room is clean, the bed is comfortable and the water pressure in the bathroom is great.  You will have wifi and internet TV if you decide to nestle in for the evening. There is easy access to a food mart if you want to make your own food, or Jon will give you great advise on where to eat.  There were scuba masks, floats, coolers, beach towels and an umbrella available for a day on the beach.

About a 15-20 minute walk to Waikiki beach, shopping and restaurants. The parking is slightly confusing so make sure you really read and pay attention. The room reminded me of a college dorm, a bed with a TV  (Netflix was nice at night while winding down), and a small kitchen. The kitchen is a little out of date, as well as the bathroom. Our suitemates locked us out a few times all night, but Jon took care of that.  Jon was a great host and gave us a lot of great suggestions for places to eat and drink, and things to do. He also provided a free surf lesson, which was a lot of fun.

Location fantastic. Our only issue was the shared bath because we didn't know. It didn't say that in the ad. The way it's set up is worse than a shared bath down the hall - it was an adjoining bath. The bath had 4 locks, so we kept our bathroom door locked on our bedroom side until we wanted to go in, then we went in and locked the bathroom from the inside on the door to the other guest's room. We forgot to unlock that one once, so the other guest couldn't get into the bathroom. They had to knock on the shared wall to get our attention so we could unlock it. Luckily we were there! The only reason I didn't lower the star rating down from 5 is because Jon, our host, really is exceptional. His advice and attention would offset any inconvenience there might be. He was always available by text, gave great restaurant and activity suggestions, even got in the car with us to show us around the immediate neighborhood.

It's a basic but very functional apartment, a TERRIFIC value for the money, especially if you plan on being active in Hawaii (why else would you be there) and don't need luxury accommodation since you won't be there much!  The nicest perks:  the apartmnet is fully equipped with beach gear, water shoes, boogie board, coolers.  I felt like a local!  I couldn't believe how close I was to a REAL SURFING BEACH... Jon can get you a surfboard or even offer a lesson or arrange a side trip to Diamond Head for a very reasonable fee.  But if you have your own board just carry it five mintues down the street and jump in the surf!  It's hard to believe a reasonably priced place like this exists so close to perfect surfing.  \n\nIt's true that you have a shared bathroom, but for me it was no big deal.  There's a bolt on both access doors;  you bolt your door from the inside and the other guest is locked out while you're there.  Nobody really uses the bathroom for more than 5 minutes (10 if you're showering) so it is a minor inconvenience given all the other amenities.  I never felt unsafe or worried with the shared bathroom, and it stayed clean the entire time, and I never even saw the other guest on the other side of the door.\n\nThe neighborhood is a quiet local area surrounded by mega hotels like Hilton Illikai and shopping like Bloomingdales and macy's, so you really have it all and can walk EVERYWHERE you need:  groceries, restaurants, shopping, beach.  I felt safe and welcome in this secret neighborhood.  People are friendly but respect your privacy and it was a perfect stay for my short getaway.  \n\nBest of all is JON.  Make no mistake, he is a king among hosts (and coming from a Superhost like me, that's a rare compliment).  Jon will take care of all your needs, he's genuinely interested in people and wants you to enjoy Hawaii.  He can pick you up and drop you at the airport for a VERY reasonable charge, tell you where to go and what to do, arrange anything.  It's like having a private tour guide that comes with the apartment.  I''m going to make all my layovers stop in Hawaii and stay at Jon's apartment every time :) "},{"_id":"121295688","date":{"$date":"2016-12-15T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10948197","reviewer_id":"71198745","reviewer_name":"Youngeun","comments":"perfect!!

I had originally booked two nights, but unfortunately my flight to Honolulu was canceled and I didn't make it until the next day. Jay was super understanding and accommodating about the situation which was super appreciated, and he was extremely reachable and available by call and text. Jay also had great recommendations and connections for food and activities, and he even curated it to the fact that I only had one day for vacation before moving to a hotel for work. \n\nJay actually has nine different properties that he rents out through Airbnb, so you may not have the exact location experience as I did. However, I had a private room and bathroom while I was there, and was in a brand new (1.5 year old condo), so while I was expecting an entire apartment to myself with a shared bath, the set-up worked for me. There is a shared common space and kitchen, and a nice mom-daughter duo was in the other room in the condo. Jay had plenty of supplies - beach chair, umbrella, towels, snorkel equipment, etc. which made it so simple to get to the beach within minutes of checking in! \n\nThe condo was also SUPER convenient to get around the area! A quick 5-10 minute walk gets you to Kahanamoku Beach and the Hilton lagoon, a 15-20 minute walk to the Shirokiya Japanese Village, and a 10 minute walk to the Ala Moana mall. I don't think anywhere was more than a 25 minute walk from where I wanted to go. \n\nHighly recommend Jay and his Waikiki Airbnb properties!

This family are just the best when it comes to hosting. The initial communication was spot on with sharing information about Hawaii and planning of activities etc. The host offers cheap airport transport helping us save money right from the start and gave us peace of mind to being picked up after a long flight.\nThe unit was walking distance to 3 stunning beaches which was very important to us. There's a giant comfortable brand new King bed the unit was clean and functional with large flatscreen tv with Netflix, desk workspace, dining area full kitchen and Air con. We were walking distance to grocery and countless local bars and restaurants, we also had a private bathroom. \nWe thoroughly enjoyed chatting with our host he was a wealth of knowledge on Hawaii and its environment, with great tips on where to go surfing snorkelling and other activities, we wouldn't of found such fabulous spots without him. With our hosts advice we ate exceptionally well and didn't have to spend more than $10 a meal.We didn't rent a car as our host gave us all info on the cheap buses and also drove us many places.\nAnother incredible thing about Jay and his family is they provide surfboards paddle boards boogie boards bikes snorkel gear beach gear incl. esky/cooler beach chairs beach towels and beach umbrella all FREE. They even provided free bottles of water and when we arrived there were beers and snacks in the fridge.\nThis was an amazing experience from beginning to end, this family have 11 listings on Airbnb and are normally always booked but if your lucky to secure one of their listings you will not be disappointed. This family is one of a kind..... Hawaii, Jay and his family were just Awesome. Thanks so much guys."},{"_id":"184390920","date":{"$date":"2017-08-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10948197","reviewer_id":"111830864","reviewer_name":"Earlene","comments":"Jay was a fantastic host.

Most weird and frustrating airbnb experience ever and felt scammed. Location and photos in listing did not match the place I stayed at. Host Jay seems friendly but does not understand customer service and was not at all helpful in resolving the multiple issues we had.\n\nThe details: I showed up at the address listed on the airbnb site (The Windsor Waikiki, a nice looking building) but it turned out that Jay had texted me a different address. When I called him he said something about the airbnb address being the old office and to go to the new location that he had texted me. I didn't think too much about it but in hindsight it was a little suspicious.\n\nWhen we finally checked-in with the small office downstairs and went to the unit, we found that the place was small and rundown which I figured is what you pay for given its location in Waikiki. \n\nHowever our stay only got worse from there. The place was not clean even though my reservation was charging $50 in cleaning fees for a 2 night stay. Cabinets, trashcan, furniture etc. were old and rusty or generally run down. There was long hair on the ground from previous visitors/guests. The tabletops, bedframe, TV had dust or streaks over it and looked like it had not been cleaned for a while. There were 2 small bottles of water in the fridge and when we ran out the second day, I drank some water from the water filter also in the fridge and immediately spat it out because it was SOUR. When I opened the lid of the water filter I saw that it was moldy on the inside. At this point I'm pretty frustrated but figured I get what I pay for in Waikiki and was still somewhat willing to let it slide.\n\nThe 2nd night when we got back, we noticed that some things were different about the place - a light we didn't know how to turn off was now off and the balcony door was open though we had left it closed. I immediately messaged Jay about this and his reply was that he had come in to turn off the AC because a neighbor had complained about it dripping. I was beyond shocked that he would just come into a place we were staying in and not say anything before, during, or after the fact. I would've been more than happy to come back to turn off the AC if it was causing problems (which I was not made aware of).\n\nIn the same conversation I told Jay about the issues we had with lack of cleanliness and filtered water being sour and how frustrated I was but his response was that guests typically buy their own water so the water filter was not meant to be used, and that he would tell the cleaning people to do a better job \"next time\" - comments that don't help me at all. I found this to be completely poor customer service and lack of understanding from the guest perspective.\n\nThankfully we were only there for a short stay. Was able to work something out with the help of an amazing airbnb support rep but I feel like I have lost my previous confidence and trust in the airbnb experience.\n\nTo be fair, Jay was easy to reach through airbnb messaging and text and gave local suggestions for food and activities. But I would recommend only conversing through the airbnb app for the important stuff so that airbnb support can more readily help you if you find yourself in the same situation as me."},{"_id":"400358194","date":{"$date":"2019-01-11T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10948197","reviewer_id":"132581759","reviewer_name":"Elise","comments":"fantastic host, fabulous local tips"},{"_id":"407335727","date":{"$date":"2019-02-01T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10948197","reviewer_id":"48228955","reviewer_name":"Rui","comments":"百万海景房,值得推荐｡"}]}

I grew up in the  the Mid-West and saw the beauty of living in California.  I was born in Venezuela and have always worked on both English and Spanish, and am able to teach both languages.  My dream was to have a home in Hawaii.  I've have spent the last few years traveling  between CA  and many of the Hawaiian Islands in search of the perfect home.  We are settling on the shores of this quaint village.  I am married with one 15 year old son, and one dog Max. I love to hike and the kings trail is close to this house. I love nature and there are wild goats over on Umi street. I love to watch movies and there is netflix at the house. I love geckos and there are brown and green ones at the house. I like deals and the Aloha Beach house is one! There is a king bed now in the master- everytime we go we make the house nicer! It's nicer than our house in California. The master bedroom downstairs is very large and has a queen bed and futon. House can accomodate large groups; I just have to charge extra due to utilities. We get lots of family groups!\r\n\r\nThis beach house has been a 30 year dream in the making!  It is always so incredible when you see your dreams come true with belief and hard work. Please come and share the  Fantastic Sunsets at  Makai Hideaway- The sunsets are phenomenal and the snorkeling / swimming hole is a two minute walk from the house.

The house is situated near a historic fishing village and is on a lava field in a quiet community.  Don't let the trip down from the highway intimidate you, just take it slow, the end result is so worth the few miles of curvy road.  The view of the Pacific was amazing!

For those of you who have never been to the Big Island, it is not the white sand beaches of postcards - but it is AMAZINGLY beautiful. This house sits in a field of lava overlooking dramatic cliffs. The drive down the hill is not for someone like my other (who is terrified of hights) but I loved driving it.  One of the best beaches on the island is only a 10 minute drive and 20 minute hike away, but be aware, you all have to drive to anywhere on this island.

Easy drive from Kona Airport with a quick stop at Target (or Wal-Mart across the highway) for food supplies before driving south to Miloli'i. We always stop at the South Kona Fruit Stand for smoothies before arriving at the Aloha Beach House. Amazing snorkeling in Honomalino Bay (get there early and you'll be treated to hours of entertainment by dolphins with no one else around). Quick drive over to Volcano National Park and super easy to all other attractions the Big Island has to offer. When you return to the Beach House, fire up the grill for dinner and enjoy your delicious Hawaiian meal on the deck.

We felt incredibly privileged that she shares her wonderful home. \r\n\r\nFirst, the location: One of the things that the Big Island is known for is its volcanoes and lava. Other than seeing actual flowing lava (which wasn't possible during our stay), one can pretty much experience the same at the seaside house. The house is on actual lava flow and one can see and experience the lava field the community is built upon. In addition, one can see and hear the ocean and the beautiful coastline from the house. There is a small black sand beach less than 20 minutes away as well as another swimming/snorkeling location less than 5 minutes (walking!) away. In short, the location is beautiful!\r\n\r\nHospitality: It is the little things that count: an up-to-date 2014 travel guide for the Big Island that we brought with us on our daily excursions, Hawaiian music CDs, DVDs, wifi, kitchen utensils, bowls and everything else you'd need to cook, laundry room, game room, water fun activity stuff...we really couldn't have asked for anything more during our stay. \r\n\r\nThe process: Cheryl was very responsive to our request to book, even though we contacted her last minute. She is very friendly and answered all of our questions promptly. Her directions were excellent, we had no problem finding the house at night. Daniel the local caretaker is a fount of local information, providing tips on what is worth the time and money and what is just a tourist trap. \r\n\r\nOther miscellaneous thoughts: the house is a ways away from the main tourist area of Kona, which is great because you can enjoy your stay away from tourists. Also, the house is great value to share with some friends as there are plenty of sleeping places. \r\n"},{"_id":"26175667","date":{"$date":"2015-02-06T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1095174","reviewer_id":"21506963","reviewer_name":"Nicholas","comments":"We loved the house!  Plenty of space to sit and relax (although we were usually out and about) and the extra goodies (kayaks, snorkeling gear, boogie boards) were so great to have.  Don't worry about bringing snorkel gear as there are about ten full sets.\n\nAs previous reviews suggested, the house is a bit out of the way (roughly an hour south of Kona and fifteen minutes down a winding road of switchbacks).  This was not too big a deal for us since it's the Big Island and we knew we would be doing a lot of driving.\n\nThere are four beds in the house and a few additional sleeping spaces (a futon, air mattress, and sofa bed).  We had 8 adults, and not all were couples, so it was a tad constricting.  One was in the futon and another in the air mattress.  Not too bad for the week we were there, but any additional time might have seemed cramped.\n\nCheryl is great at communication leading up to the trip.  I had several questions and she usually responded within minutes.\n\nDaniel, who watches over the house since Cheryl doesn't live in the area, is a treasure trove of information.  He is very fun and loves to help with any planning.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend the house.

The beds were comfortable, the bathrooms well stocked with shampoo, soap, sunscreen, ointments, etc., and the view of the ocean off the front lanai was excellent.\r\n\r\nThe kitchen is well stocked with everything you need to make good food, and the living area has comfortable furniture and even amenities like Netflix.\r\n\r\nThe caretaker, \"Uncle\" Dan, was friendly and outgoing. He is also a fount of local information, and he gave us directions to an excellent local beach. This beach is hard to get to, but is fantastic.\r\n\r\nThe house also has just about everything you need for an island stay: many pairs of snorkels and flippers, kayaks, body boards, water shoes, and numerous other stuff to make your stay pleasant. The fact that you are a one minute walk from excellent snorkeling in the bay doesn't, hurt, either.\r\n\r\nThe listing is very accurate, and the photos match the house. The house itself is very nicely appointed with nice art and colours. It didn't feel like we were invading anyone's personal space, and it was very comfortable.\r\n\r\nThe only \"drawback\" has more to do with the island itself than the house. It is fairly remote, and it takes a lot of driving to get anywhere. Not that distances as so far: you can only drive about 35 mph / 60 km/h, so it takes a while to get anywhere. The twisty roads take some getting used to, especially for a Canadian who's used to wide open spaces and straight roads. None of this detracts from the house, which was exactly as advertized.\r\n\r\nOverall, the house was what we expected, the hosts were fantastic, and the view of the ocean off the lanai is great. We had an excellent time, and I would recommend this house to anyone who wants to \"get away from it all\" in a secluded location."},{"_id":"27971914","date":{"$date":"2015-03-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1095174","reviewer_id":"28935124","reviewer_name":"Katie","comments":"Cheryl's home is absolutely gorgeous. It's in a quiet neighborhood with wonderful views of the ocean. We loved spending time in the bright living room surrounded by views of the ocean and on the wrap around balcony. Daniel greeted us and made us feel welcome - he was full of insider knowledge and great tips. \r\n\r\nThe house is at the bottom of a steep and winding road - the drive down from the highway takes 10-15 minutes depending on your comfort. The road is well paved and you do not need a 4 wheel drive.\r\n\r\nEverything you could need for the beach is provided, including snorkel gear and kayaks. Although we didn't have the opportunity to use the kayaks or the snorkel gear because the waves were very rough near the house - I think this is uncommon and was due to a swell passing through. There are 3 good size bedrooms plus a queen bed in the game room. I think the house could comfortably sleep 4 couples plus a couple of children on air mattresses and pull out couches. Note that the game room, bathroom, and large bedroom downstairs are not connected to the main living space upstairs.\r\n\r\nVolcano National Park is about 1 - 1.5 hours away and Hilo can be reached in 2 hours with no traffic, if you really book it (we were late for a flight). Captain Cook is not too far, but the traffic took us nearly an hour. Make sure to bring your own food to the house. All kitchen items are provided.\r\n\r\nWe only wish we could have stayed longer. I think the house is a great place to relax and enjoy the quiet and wonderful view. There are some wonderful hikes nearby and Volcano National Park is not too far. We're hoping to bring our family back."},{"_id":"30490077","date":{"$date":"2015-04-23T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1095174","reviewer_id":"23425018","reviewer_name":"Tracey","comments":"Having Daniel check us in was great. Gave all the pertenant information and giving us some local insite in where to go was an added bonus. By having Cheryl check in a few times before the scheduled arrival it made me feel like she was there and not just a hotel that you check in/out and thats it. Cheryl you made it a very personal experience and that is nice. Thank you.  I think the only description that I either missed or was not there was just the windy roads to mile marker 89 and the 3 miles down to the subdivision. I am very glad we arrived in daylight as the road could have been a  little scary in the dark first time round. Some people may not enjoy those trips daily up/down that road. Might be nice as a heads up for potential guests. Just a thought. The sunsets views as well as the sunrises were incredible. That was spot on. The neighborhood was very quiet and felt really safe there (when we were there). I think the place was fantastic. I sure hope that the new houses going up don't affect the view but really unless it is a high rise the views will still be spectacular. Location was great. Close to Volcano, South Point and  getting to Hilo. It was also great heading back into Kona. Windy roads definitely slow travel down but gets you to look at all the local land. We did not even have to spend money on snorkeling trips as we had enough gear and enough beaches to go do it ourselves. Tons of dolphins within feet of us. Turtles. Many fishes and we believe one small shark! I mean the beauty was everywhere. Just know that the beaches nearby are not your typical sandy white beaches but beautiful in their own special ways. Make a point to eat local kine foods. Markets, fruit/vege stands all over. Fresh fish. Cook at the house....We had a few of our best meals at home and local grown foods. No paid for luau needed. I got to eat poi daily. ONOLICIOUS! Mahalo nui Cheryl for a beautiful comfortable home and the most perfect lanai. Until next time.

It's a large spacious property with great views to both the lava flows and ocean.  This house is amazing and it's kinda surreal being surrounded by the black lava flows but also totally wonderful experience.  We all thoroughly enjoyed the comfort of the house and there were lots of extras in the property which made it homely and also came in very useful (kayak \u0026 snorkeling gear).  It is off the main road near the ocean so it feels very calm at night, good if you are just wanting to get away from it all.  It also makes perfect viewing for starts at night.  During the day you can take advantage of being a short drive to the volcano national park, the black or green sand beaches or a drive up to Kona or Hilo...of course there is a lot of things in the house so you could just relax there or wander down to the local fishing village and buy some fresh fish.  We did this and had a BBQ on the decking.  It was a nice way to spend our last night.  We were there 4 nights 5 days and will definitely be back...there is still SOOOOO much to do!

The property is set up as a nice beach house or a lake side cottage for that matter and has enough space to sleep large groups of up to 9.  The house has 3 bathrooms and modern amenities such as WiFi and a lot of beach friendly gear such as fins, snorkeling equipment, body boards, and kayaks.  There is a great DVD collection as well, specially for kids.  Enough has been said about Daniel, the wonderful neighbor and caretaker, in past reviews but I must add that he makes the stay all the more pleasant and comfortable.  He knows the Island very well and will give you valuable advice on activities and excursions among other things.  Cheryl is a great host and promptly responded to all of our inquiries and questions and made sure that we were set up for a great time prior to arrival.  Please note that the nearest supermarkets are near Kona which is a 45 minute drive so when Cheryl tells you to do grocery shopping prior to showing up at the Beach House on the first day, please take that advice.  This is a great location for visiting Volcano National Park but it is a bit of a drive if you want to visit places such as Mauna Key and Hilo so factor that into planning excursions as well.

We originally had a larger party and our hands were tied for bed space. Some dropped out of the trip, but we decided to keep our reservation. We were pleasantly surprised by the amount of gear and the plethora of sizes the home had (kayaks, snorkels, and even water shoes). Sometimes places boast these things and they never fit or there isn't enough for everyone, but for our party of 5 there was plenty. \r\n\r\nCheryl and Daniel were great and made our late arrival very easy. There are plenty of guides and brochures in the home for activities, though everything will take some time to drive to.\r\n\r\nThe kitchen was very nice, though ants can be a problem if you leave anything on the counter. The geckos were cute to all but one in our party who doesn't like lizards.\r\n\r\nWord of warning, my boyfriend and I got eaten alive by some type of bug the first night (not sure when it happened - maybe while eating dinner outside on the patio... these weren't the typical mosquito bites - maybe fleas?), so be sure to apply plenty of bug repellent. We didn't get any more bites after using some, but it made the rest of the trip pretty uncomfortable (they were all over our feet so we couldn't wear proper shoes without discomfort). The others in our party were fine (only a couple of mosquito bites here and there). We didn't tell our hosts until the end of the trip, so there wasn't much they could do, but they said they do spray the home for pests every month. They can't help the location after all (it's a tropical island! We only wish we were better prepared)\r\n\r\nOverall, if you know what you are getting (remote, quiet, private location right on the beach), don't mind not having AC, and wear plenty of bug repellent this place is a great stay.

We love the South Kona area, warm days, cool nights, ocean breeze, stars fill the night sky, watch wales from the deck, waves splashing on the lava, very few bugs and the ones that were there got zapped by the largest bug zapper we have every seen. And best sunsets ever, first night we saw the Green Splash! Walk or hike the area and Daniel will tell you how to get to a very private black sand beach and some other places to visit, such as Hookena  Beach Park, only a short drive. Wish we had gone there our first day, as we waited our last day to visit this beach and still got to swim with the Dolphins. WOW!

As a flat-lander the location was fantastic with scenic views of the Pacific. There is so much to do south of the house, from black sand beach, green sand beech the southern most point in US and Volcano National Park(VNP). The park is up there with the Grand Caynon for me. Cheryl is a great hostess and helped me with the many questions I had before the trip. When you get to the house Daniel is there to help you in any way. Cheryl and Daniel both recommended the night time Manta Ray dive(sorkel) with Hang Loose.  The drive with the rays is an experience I would never forget.

The area is not exactly what you'd expect for Hawaiian scenery--it is in a community built on lava rocks--but it is relaxing nonetheless. The house has several high-quality kayaks that are free to use, and is very close to a very scenic cove where is excellent to use them. We spent a full day kayaking to a nearby beach, where we used sand toys that were also provided in the house.\n\nThe only downside for the house is the location: it is quite a ways south of Captain Cook, and the last few miles are down an exceptionally windy road. If you plan to travel in to Captain Cook or Kona every day, then the drive might get a bit tiresome. But you won't find a house that has nearly as good a deal as this anywhere near the cities, so you get what you pay for. For us, the opportunity to rent such a wonderful and large home for such a great rate more than made up for the commute."},{"_id":"170151773","date":{"$date":"2017-07-14T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1095174","reviewer_id":"97401764","reviewer_name":"Matt","comments":"Great place for someone looking for some peace and quiet.

We were very comfortable and it was easy to settle right in and feel at home. Just a side note: If you are in need of a chiropractor, (yes, unfortunately I was) Mark Cohen in Ocean View saved my vacation! We found the drive up and down the hill to the sub division (switch back lane, lol)  an opportunity  for jokes, laughter and a great view.

The view from the deck is beautiful, it's the perfect spot to enjoy your morning coffee or a nice homemade breakfast. Daniel was very helpful with planning out our days and the House Manual (the yellow folder) also has great suggestions for more places to explore.\n\nAll in all this house provides you with everything you need to enjoy your days on the Big Island.

We couldn’t have made a better choice. Cheryl has a beautiful house in a great location. We were 7 adults celebrating my daughter’s college graduation and our 32nd anniversary in May 2018. After we planned the trip, Kilaueua erupted and that made us even more excited to visit. Unfortunately, it also meant vog on our side of the island, eliminating the Fantastic Sunsets part of the equation. But it also meant less direct sun, so much cooler. Cheryl’s house is ideal if you want to get away from the madding crowd, but have access to all the Big Island has to offer. We were out of the house every day by 7am and back in time to make dinner and enjoy each other’s company. Our itinerary included Honomalino Beach, South Point, Discovery Harbor, Green Sand Beach, Punalu'u Black Sand Beach, Hilo, Rainbow Falls, Mauna Kea, Makalawena Beach, Kahalu’u Beach Park, Kealakekua Bay (visit Ehu \u0026 Kai Adventures for rentals – family-owned!), Captain Cook monument, and the City of Refuge - Pu'uhonua O Hōnaunau National Historical Park. All with Miloli’I as our home base. It IS 10 minutes off the hwy down a winding road with a 1500-foot drop in elevation, but that’s a good thing to me! There was nothing we needed that wasn’t already in the house, except food, but including spices. The property description is excellent; the house is exactly as described. One thing that I didn’t pick up on is that the water cistern isn’t for drinking water – Cheryl provides that in a couple of water cooler/dispensers with plenty of extra jugs of water. But water became our only problem – more below. Thought we would use the ping pong \u0026 pool tables, but no time – we were never in the house. Never turned the TVs on either. The house did get hot after being locked up all day, but it cooled off fast with so many windows and screen doors and fans. Costco IS a sensible first stop before coming to the house. We planned out our meals and got most all the ingredients there. We ended up with too much food though, and took most of the excess over to Pahoa to donate to the Leilani Estates evacuation center. Funny though; we didn’t seem to have an excess of alcohol.  But as with most marvelous properties, everything’s great as long as everything’s great. But what happens when something happens? I think that’s when you find out what kind of host you have. For us, it came on the 7th day- no water came out of the faucets. We let Cheryl \u0026 Daniel know, and they immediately went to work trying to find the problem. It turned out we were out of water, which was a little odd since we were fairly conservative on water use and the house has a big tank. But Daniel..."},{"_id":"274669449","date":{"$date":"2018-06-09T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1095174","reviewer_id":"190348075","reviewer_name":"Patrick","comments":"Great house with a fantastic local black sand beach and wonderful ocean views.

Finally, working with Cheryl is effortless, and the host Daniel is friendly and helpful.  Take Cheryl’s advice and be sure to shop on your way in for necessities.

We stayed there for two days for an event down at Milolii. The whole house was already opened for us upon arrival and I had to sign a form that Daniel brought personally to the home. There were no sponges to wash dishes but was addressed by owner quickly and the manager Daniel brought them by. Upon arrival the house was extremely hot, like an oven with only 2 fans for the 14 people upstairs and downstairs. By the next morning the house cooled down much and was fine for the rest of our stay. Would recommend adding fans for every room in the future. The water was not drinkable due to the machines spitting out white particles even when we changed bottles so we were lucky we brought our own as this house is on catchment. The house was nicely decorated and very beautiful and mostly clean. It had EVERYTHING we needed from paper plates to fresh coffee and creamer and lots of dishes, dishwasher, towels etc which was a great touch. There was even a cute disco ball, pool table in the living room.  Daniel was kind of strange but didn’t bother us besides check in and we were thankful to Cheryl for her accommodating such a large group and think she really puts thought and time into her airBnB even though she is in the mainland. There is a cliff-ocean view and beautiful starry skies but the beach is a small drive away. All in all we would stay here again and thought the overall experience was great for the reason we stayed."},{"_id":"348925470","date":{"$date":"2018-11-15T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1095174","reviewer_id":"169237335","reviewer_name":"Bin","comments":"住在这里真正的意义就是Honomalino海滩,一个会让你足够惊喜的黑沙滩,在这里可以感受到真正的夏威夷,人非常少,沙滩很细,非常适合游泳,浮潜和划船,这个沙滩的品质个人感觉在大岛是顶级的｡开车先到Milolii海滩,把车停在篮球场旁边,然后沿着小路徒步十几分钟就到了这个黑沙滩,路上还长了野生的诺丽果｡还有一个彩蛋,就是从房子去公路的路边上有一个自助的水果摊,有香蕉,木瓜和杨桃卖,价格非常便宜,又非常好吃,千万别错过了｡"},{"_id":"357284076","date":{"$date":"2018-12-09T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1095174","reviewer_id":"222614238","reviewer_name":"Jeffrey","comments":"What an incredible place!

We were a large family gathering for Christmas and it was a wonderful place to be able  to do just that.  It was spacious and clean and offered great amenities for the kids to play as well as what you would need to take to the beach  The morning view was my favorite, very relaxing and beautiful. The kids loved the adventures to the water and discovering hidden gems.  The community has a speed limit of 15 mph with very little traffic so the kids were able to walk and play carefree outside.  This made my 6th trip to Hawaii (first to Kona) and it was simply wonderful. The house is on the south end of the island which is good in regards to proximity to beautiful beaches that are not crowded, including the one by the house past the village (just be prepared for a bit of a hike but it is well worth it when you arrive)  My kids and I managed to make it to 5 different beaches (1 of them 2 x) Our favorite was Punalu'u Black sand beach (sea turtles).  If you want to relax or hike or have an adventure Cheryl's house puts you in the right place to do so."},{"_id":"367441103","date":{"$date":"2019-01-04T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1095174","reviewer_id":"18412256","reviewer_name":"Sallie","comments":"Cheryl is a very friendly hostess.

It was a few minute walk to the ocean, but not necessarily the beach you would consider safe to swim in.  The coast is a cliff made of lava rock and a rope to pull yourself up/down to.  During the times we walked in the morning and evening (in February) the waves were crashing strongly into that coast line so we refrained from getting in.  The home is has a lot of amenities and activities for young families with kids (games, snorkel equipment, movies, etc).  Unfortunately for our stay, the place didn’t appear to be cleaned properly.  With proper cleaning, the place would be charming and perfect for families looking for a quiet place with a view."}]}

Sam got in touch with me several days before my reservation to provide detailed instructions for reaching the guesthouse from the airport, including photographs and a video of how to operate the keypad entry system for self-check-in.  Very helpful!\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there was a rather serious hiccup, beyond Sam's control, the morning I was scheduled to arrive.  Sam messaged me to say there was a problem with the plumbing in my room and while I would could drop my bags off, he would need a few extra hours to bring in the right technicians to fix the situation.  Although I was disappointed that I couldn't use the room right away, Sam remained in constant communication throughout the repair process and guaranteed me I would have a place to sleep that night.  Ultimately, Sam was not able to get the plumbing fixed that day, but he arranged for me to stay in a different, bigger room, and all was well.  I understand these things happen, and Sam handled the situation as well as one could be expected to.\r\n\r\nAgain, I recommend staying with Sam for the reasons given above, but I do want to note that the room, and the bathroom in particular, is strikingly small.  I expected that in Hong Kong for this price, and it wasn't a problem, but don't expect otherwise.  That said, the modern design make the room comfortable and functional, and the location in the heart of the action just off Nathan Road in Kowloon cannot be beat."},{"_id":"107703678","date":{"$date":"2016-10-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10977704","reviewer_id":"73856325","reviewer_name":"Jhovelis","comments":"I would definitely recommend staying at Sam's listing.

There was hot water every day, the door lock is digital so you don't have to carry keys around or stress about losing them (the digital door lock has an additional manual lock on the inside), and I can't stress how great it was to come home to a functioning AC after a long day of sightseeing - Hong Kong is HUMID.\r\n\r\nOn top of all the aforementioned, Sam is an awesome host. He's one of the most helpful and thorough hosts I've had so far. He contacted me a couple of days before my trip with very detailed instructions on how to get to the listing and operate the digital door lock - he even included several pictures and a video. On my second day there, I dropped my phone out on Lantau Island and completely trashed the screen. When I got back to the room, I contacted Sam and he gave me detailed instructions on where to get it fixed. He even made sure to tell me to visit several shops before committing to a price - which because of the set-up of the location, proved to be indispensable advice.\r\n\r\nAs a female travelling alone, I couldn’t have had a better host. Definitely staying there again when I go back."},{"_id":"109311436","date":{"$date":"2016-10-20T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10977704","reviewer_id":"85573918","reviewer_name":"Hyunwoo","comments":"개인실 좋아하는 분들에겐 좋을거같습니다\n리모델링 한 곳이라 깔끔하고 매일 청소해줍니다 평일에 가서 그런지 원래 호스트를 만날일은 없는거 같긴한데 우연찮게 호스트 두명 다 만나게 되었는데 아주 친절했습니다 역이랑 가깝고 괜춘합니다\n또 메신저로 연락이 잘 되어서 질문하면 잘 답해줍니다\n\nSam is so friendly~ n good provide service~~  bad is  just weather!!

Location is in Kowloon and the train station is only a few mins away. HK subway system is amazing and efficient so larger luggage can be brought with ease. The building where this room is located has an elevator so no worries about bringing your bags up flights of stairs. Room was small but clean. Shower didn't really have any hot water. Overall it was a good place to stay for less than 24 hours or if you're in town for some quick business. Sam was also great and very detailed with his directions on how to get to and get in to the room! He included suggestions on best transportation methods to get from airport to the airbnb building in Kowloon. If you arrice after midnight, you'll have to take overnight buses. For MTR routing apps, download \"Moovit\".

I basically MTR-ed everywhere from there :) Sam's photo instructions via (Hidden by Airbnb) was clear, concise and made it really easy. There was a 7-11, banks and everything was close by. Perfect place to explore the city from. The room was clean and digital locks meant no key hassles, water was nice and hot, I even got a personalised welcome note with clear communication and wifi instructions. My only regret was I didn't have much time to get to know Sam \u0026 Andy, but I'll be back next trip!

Very close from both of airport bus and subway, easy to access both of Kowloon and Hongkong island. Only 15 min walk from China ferry terminal that you can go to Macau. Definitely to book again!"},{"_id":"218782023","date":{"$date":"2017-12-15T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10977704","reviewer_id":"159031897","reviewer_name":"은경","comments":"위치 좋고, 호스트 정말 친절합니다. 청결상태 유지에 힘쓰는 흔적이 많이 보입니다. 홍콩 건물 특성상 그건물에서 깨끗하기 힘들것 같은데 괜찮았습니다. 창문이 커서 밝고 환기가 잘 되어 좋았습니다. 큰 기대를 하지 않고 가면 만족 할 수준 입니다. 호텔 수준은 당연히 기대하지 말아야합니다. 가격대비 위치 좋고 괜찮습니다."},{"_id":"219560171","date":{"$date":"2017-12-18T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10977704","reviewer_id":"21402633","reviewer_name":"Songyi","comments":"짱 예쁘고 좋음\n식당가도 근처에 있고 쪼음"},{"_id":"221072087","date":{"$date":"2017-12-25T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10977704","reviewer_id":"107082717","reviewer_name":"Phoebe","comments":"第二次住Sam的房间了!佐敦跟尖沙咀的房间一样都很棒!"},{"_id":"223253906","date":{"$date":"2018-01-01T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10977704","reviewer_id":"144028193","reviewer_name":"He","comments":"超级赞哦!在香港这样寸土寸金的地方有这样的房间入住真的不错,房间设计简直完美,再合理不过了,简介漂亮,完全方便也安全,大厦不是那种旅馆特别的集中的地方,人不挤,安全性也好｡旁边不远就是庙街夜市,宵夜真是棒极了,去地铁,机场都方便,总之,五星好评,期待下次入住呢!"},{"_id":"224386108","date":{"$date":"2018-01-03T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"10977704","reviewer_id":"34964043","reviewer_name":"Liyana","comments":"It’s a must stay!

Just one tip to my fellow travellers, make sure you put away the toilet roll and bin before you take a shower! \n\nWhen I arrived earlier than check-in time, Sam readily offered me an area for my bags so I didn’t have to worry about lugging them\naround. He also suggested I store my bags at the guesthouse if I was staying around after checking out.\n\nSam is uber responsive and ensures you have all the information necessary for a wonderful stay. \n\nThank you Sam!

The spatial arrangement of the house, which I speculate would have been built in the 50s or 60s, is great: two bedrooms are in the first floor, luminous but protected from direct exposure to sunlight, excellent for peaceful sleep. A spacious and nicely decorated living room upstairs boasts a commanding view of the garden, the sea, and the neighboring island (Heybeliada). The living room connects to a kitchen and a balcony overlooking the garden where we enjoyed our meals. The garden was my favorite spot. It is not for those who love neatly arranged, engineered, and regularly maintained gardens. Sanem´s is an essentially picturesque garden with wild plants that look like being there for ages. There are regularized pockets where Sanem has planted tomatoes, cucumbers, and green peppers. I loved watering them. She graciously let us taste mulberries and plums. Four different plum trees, two different mulberry trees, a cherry tree, a sour cherry tree, fig tree, vines, roses, loquat, and of course the sublime pine tree partly covered by a delightful bougainvillea... Yes, this is still considered to be Istanbul. The notorious phaeton noises and manure smells of Büyükada stay away from this house. We only smelt flowers and post-rain soil, and heard beautiful seagulls whose concert sabotaged occasionally by gangs of crows plotting to take plums and mulberries away... Despite all its peacefulness, the house is not completely isolated: there are two small groceries and a restaurant just about fifty meters down the street. Sanem is a lovely person. She met us at the check-in, made sure we had a pleasant stay, and encouraged us to contact her anytime should there be any inconvenience, which never happened. Great house, dream garden.

A lot of free fun things to do. like walking over the Brooklyn Bridge,  and walking up into Chinatown and Little Italy.  Taking the free ferry to Staten Island, which takes you right by the Statue of Liberty ! Central Park and Times Square ! Museums and much much more. Fun and exciting. Pack your bags and welcome to my home.

He gave me all the subway info I needed easily, and all his info was accurate. As if this guy hadn't done more than enough already, he ended up giving me a pair of tennis shoes bc my luggage didn't make it and I had no shoes suitable for walking the streets of NY.

Judy et Sasha ont tout fait pour que notre fils de deux ans puisse dormir avec nous dans la chambre sur un vrai matelas. Le bruit de l'avenue peut déranger, surtout la nuit, mais le ronronnement de la clim couvre le plus gros. \r\nLe quartier est super : d'un côté, Fulton Mall fourmille, et de l'autre, Smith St. et Court St. sont plus élégantes. Le quartier regorge de restos, cafés, bars et boulangeries. Sasha et Judy fournissent une liste de leurs endroits préférés. A un pâté de maison, vous trouverez les lignes A et C à la station Hoyt Schermerhorn, qui vous emmène dans le Sud de Manhattan en dix minutes...\r\nJudy et Sasha sont des hôtes discrets et prévenants. Nous avons échangé par texto avant notre arrivé et pendant notre séjour. Ils ont répondu à toutes nos demandes avec réactivité et élégance. Nous avons vraiment eu l'impression d'habiter Brooklyn le temps d'une semaine et avons quitté NYC avec des souvenirs inoubliables..."},{"_id":"6910818","date":{"$date":"2013-08-30T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1101035","reviewer_id":"255210","reviewer_name":"Susan","comments":"Judy was great all around.

The apartment was cosy and tastefully decorated. And It had all the amenities I needed while traveling to New York on business. The apartment was spacious which was great as I dislike small and cramped living spaces. \r\n\r\nThe neighborhood felt safe and has some really cool stores that are worth checking out. There are also some nice restaurants, bars, bakeries and cafés. Check out Bacchus! Its a nice french restaurant close to the corner of Bond St. and Atlantic Ave. And for midnight munchies there are a few 24 hour convenience stores near by. It is also worth mentioning that the apartment is within walking distance to the bustling Fulton Mall stretch, where you can find good buys.\r\n\r\nI found the Hoyt-Schermerhorn subway station to be very convenient as it was very close to the apartment. You can catch both the A and C lines which will take you in and out of Manhattan in about 10 minutes or so.\r\n\r\nJudy was a joy to deal with and I thank her for her hospitality. She answered my questions swiftly and responded to a slight glitch in the internet quickly which was a great help. Even though I was only in New York City for 4 days, I felt like I was just settling in and enjoying all that New York City had to offer. I will definitely return to Judy's place the next time I am in New York!"},{"_id":"7290776","date":{"$date":"2013-09-14T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1101035","reviewer_id":"5502553","reviewer_name":"Joan","comments":"Judy has an absolutely beautiful apartment!

Judy was the perfect host.  She responded quickly to all of my emails.  I traveled from California to New York with my husband and 9-month-old baby for my brother's wedding in Brooklyn.  The apartment was just a short drive from JFK.  When we entered the apartment, we were really pleased with the modern, eclectic decor (I want her to come and decorate my place in CA!).  I LOVED seeing locally made granola and organic milk and bananas waiting for us in the kitchen.  It made me feel right at home!  Having a small infant, I was very particular about staying in a clean place, and Judy's apartment did not disappoint.  I felt safe preparing my little one's food in the kitchen with the dishes and utensils provided, giving him a bath in the tub, and letting him roam around the living room and bedroom.  Also, the apartment is really close to some great shops and restaurants!  We loved frequenting Grumpy Bert (little store with unique art, toys, gifts, etc.) every day, which is right downstairs from the apartment!  We were also blocks away from Rucola, a tiny Italian restaurant, where we had some of the best pasta ever!  Judy provided us with a folder of cafe/restaurant recommendations, and we loved every single one that we visited!    Next time we go to New York, we will definitely try to stay here again!

The pictures set up a high level of expectation and the reality did not disappoint, the apartment was beautiful, well-decorated, and clean.\r\n\r\nAs someone who had lived in Brooklyn previously, I appreciated that the apartment gave me the experience again of \"living\" in a Brooklyn neighborhood.  Along with all the nearby restaurants and conveniences, especially nice was the fact that the apartment was in a very central location; whether one wanted to walk around to nearby neighborhoods in Brooklyn or take one of many close-by subway lines into Manhattan, one could do so quickly and easily.  \r\n\r\nWe also greatly appreciated the small thoughtful touches that made us feel welcome and allowed us to quickly acclimate to the apartment and neighborhood.  Judy and Sasha allowed us to check in early and had granola, yogurt, fresh fruit and coffee waiting for us-- all of which we were quite thankful for after a long red-eye flight.  The thorough notes of information and instructions regarding the area and the apartment also made it clear that these were hosts who thought of nearly everything that might make their guests' stay better and left no detail unconsidered. \r\n\r\nWe would definitely stay in the apartment again, should we be lucky enough to find it available next time we come to NYC."},{"_id":"18466183","date":{"$date":"2014-08-27T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1101035","reviewer_id":"5462510","reviewer_name":"Melanie","comments":"I took my parents to NYC and chose Judy's place to stay.

We loved every minute staying in this expansive and comfortable apartment and would happily return.\r\n\r\nBooking/Arrival: Judy and Alex made the booking system really straightforward and responded via email promptly to all our questions before arriving re getting from airport, car services, weather etc etc. Due to timings we used a key safe to retrieve keys - no issues at all.\r\n\r\nApartment: Exactly as described and photographed. It is a really lovely light and airy proper 1 bedroom apartment. The bed is a comfy US queen-size (5ft) bed with a good mattress - we slept soundly every night. For two, the space was great, we loved having the bedroom, lounge and dining room to spread out in. The bathroom - often the thing that lets down many places has been refitted recently and is very clean, it has a decent power-shower with piping hot water and a separate nook for the laundry appliances. The sofa in the lounge was large and comfy, great for lazing on after day on your feet. Kitchen is well equipped and a dishwasher was nice touch. There's the right amount of furniture and it's neither overcrowded \u0026 cluttered nor minimalist. The heating worked well and we were never cold (stayed in mid Dec) - the heating is old so you experience the hiss and whoosh of the steam pipes but we found it strangely comforting.\r\n\r\nLocation: Steps from Atlantic Avenue, 3 blocks from the multitude of subway lines running through the Atlantic Avenue terminal (where you buy your Metro Card) which whizz you into Manhattan within 20 mins. The area is full of independent boutique shops, lovely restaurants and cafes - some dangerously close. It's a great spot to explore Brooklyn from as well: we took a suggested walk from our hosts and covered Cobble Hill, Caroll Gardens, Brooklyn Heights as well as Boerum Hill. The Brooklyn Bridge Park is well worth a visit. There was so much to do and see, we simply couldn't fit everything in. You're also only a 15min walk away the top end of Prospect Park.\r\n\r\nHosts: Anytime we had a question, Judy or Alex responded very quickly by email with suggestions or information accordingly. We never got to meet them but then we were out all day, every day of our 6 night stay. They were simply wonderful and were able to give us a late check out which was much appreciated. They thought of all sorts of little things e.g. earplugs for city living, fresh milk, a host of useful maps and their guide to local restaurants and services. We were so happy staying here, we would have asked to stay another week had our schedule allowed it.\r\n\r\nWe wouldn't hesitate to say 'stay here' or return ourselves."},{"_id":"25048264","date":{"$date":"2015-01-05T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1101035","reviewer_id":"9072416","reviewer_name":"Caleb","comments":"Great neighbourhood, close to plenty of restaurants, cafes, food and a subway station.

(Judy and Alex are only a ring or text away to answer your questions or respond to requests and are incredibly lovely people!) The modern kitchen with a full sized refrigerator, incredible stove/oven AND dishwasher --not to mention granite countertops--is such a treat to have in New York where eating out for every meal can be quite pricey.

The biggest bonus for long term guests is the full sized washer and dryer! The bottom line is this apt. is cute and cozy with all the amenities of a full sized home and I can't wait to book my next visit! By the way, if you worry about street noise, NO WORRIES! This flat is located on a side street and with closed windows I never heard a thing. Wonderful restaurants, coffee shops, and cafes just steps out your door, as well as grocery stores and boutiques that offer everything you could ever want/need.

She even invited me to the party she was having on Memorial Day (unfortunately I couldn't go!) and was thoughtful enough to check with me about going to work the next day and made sure to wrap things up early so I could go to bed on time. She provided a book with recommendations for places to eat and when she found out my friend is a novelist, emailed recommendations for where to write and meet other authors.  I couldn't have asked for a more thoughtful, considerate host, who was always available when I needed her! That said, I didn't need her much at all because the apartment was just perfect.

We cooked Italian in the kitchen and had everything we needed as far as utensils, pots, pans, dinnerware, etc.  There were plenty of towels in the bathroom and a wonderful washer and dryer that we put to good use.  The guidebook was so informative, we didn't have to ask for any further information or suggestions for restaurants, grocery stores and other kinds of shops.

Excellent location near Atlantic Ave in the heart of Boerum Hill.  The place was roomy for NY and easily accommodated us for 4 nights.   It was nice to have the extra small bedroom to use as a luggage storer, and extra crash pad when my son showed up.  The building is quiet and the apartment itself was well furnished and clean.  It was a super hot weekend in NYC, so the A/C wa working overtime, but Sasha brought down a dehumidifier to help.   Kitchen and bathroom were spacious and had all the essentials.

We had to go buy laundry detergent, but left anything we couldn't use for the next guests.  We also left what juice and alcohol we couldn't drink.  The next guests will be very lucky!!  The ants aren't too bad of a problem... Just wipe down and don't leave any food out.  The a/c units were fine except the guest bedroom wouldn't necessarily cool the whole room due to there being a huge hole in the window.  The en suite for the master wouldn't drain too well.\r\n\r\nParking was easy and convenient.  Get a compact car, though, as with the rest of Waikiki, the parking spaces are tight!  The amenities in the building were fine.  There were always people using the pool and game room, but no one in the work out room.  Not sure if the machines work or not...  No treadmills either, which is kinda a bummer.  \r\n\r\nAll in all, this as a decently priced rental in a good location.  Not much to complain about."},{"_id":"8966590","date":{"$date":"2013-11-29T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1104768","reviewer_id":"2904612","reviewer_name":"Samuel","comments":"Awesome location, fantastic view, we were able to walk just about everywhere in less than 10 minutes.

It has an amazingly breathtaking view from the 34th floor of Waikiki and the ocean. The two balconies were a plus even though we were always mainly on the one off the living room area. The first day we got there, we weren't sure how to use the shower in the master bedroom and apparently we were the first ones with this problem haha but Roger was very helpful and easy to get a hold of to help us out with this minor problem. The security at the front lobby were also very friendly to our group because there were only two sets of keys and they would us into the building when we didn't have a set on us when our groups split up. On our last day there, our flight out was not until 9pm and Roger was very accommodating to our group in allowing us to stay later than check out so that we would have a place to shower and store our luggage. Bath towels were more than plentiful and the en suite laundry machine was more than helpful. Overall, our group of 7 had a lovely and comfortable stay at this condo. I would most definitely book this place again if and when I go back to Hawaii.\r\n\r\nThank you for all your help and this lovely time in Waikiki, Roger!"},{"_id":"11790578","date":{"$date":"2014-04-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1104768","reviewer_id":"11286374","reviewer_name":"Po-Hsun","comments":"Great location, it takes only 10 mins to walk to Waikiki beach. \r\n\r\nThe view is just awesome!!!  \r\n\r\nIf you have rent a car, there is a parking place inside the building! \r\n\r\n"},{"_id":"14552071","date":{"$date":"2014-06-22T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1104768","reviewer_id":"4838646","reviewer_name":"Joe","comments":"The view was great!

Who was prompt in replying to us, easy to contact and he also held some packages from Amazon for us which we really appreciated.  His office is located 2 blocks over, where you get the keys from.  \r\n\r\nWe felt we received great value for money, considering what we spent the week before.  We had spent the week prior at The Hilton Grand Vacation Club, which was lovely but always so busy.  We were sucked in to stay there with all of the pools it boasted, but the pools in the hotels are small and always PACKED (impossible to get a chair etc).  The ocean is also warmer than the pools.  This is a residential building so unlike the Hilton, you don't have to wait 5 years for the lift to come and the lobby isn't filled with 100s of people.\r\n\r\nWe stayed here with 4 adults and 3 children and there were plenty of beds for everyone, and enough room for dining and recreation.  This apartment is located in central Waikiki, one short block from the main shopping/restaurant drag.  Over the main drag are all the hotels located on the beach so you just walk through those to get to the beach.  Very easy walk to everywhere, even for young children carrying their body boards and beach chairs.  \r\n\r\nThe beds and pillows were comfortable, and you can hear no noise from other apartments.  It should be noted that the air conditioners in each room are very noisy.  I can sleep through this type of \"white\" noise, but my husband found it difficult at times.  You could probably sleep with the air con off if you had it on all evening anyways. The bathrooms are tiny, but they also are at the hotels.  \r\n\r\nThe apartment was clean and had everything we needed in good working order, washer, dryer, dishwasher etc.  Even body boards and beach chairs! We hired 2 cars and had 2 free parks - great compared to the price you pay to park at hotels.  Note: arrow facing down when you push your key into the car park entry and you have to push hard, it's spring loaded but we couldn't get it to work at first so remember: elbow grease and arrow facing down.  Same for the key operated lift in the car park.\r\n\r\nThe view from the 34th floor is wonderful, great view of the Hilton's friday night fireworks and the 4th of July fireworks.  The pictures on here make the apartment look quite far back from the beach, but they are deceiving, it's really not.  The beach is so beautiful, the water so blue and clear and the water quite flat, it was shallow, many people had their young infants at the beach.  It's really great.  \r\n\r\nThe apartment is older, but it was fine for us and we would stay again.\r\nFeel free to contact me for more info and tips :)\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"_id":"15622824","date":{"$date":"2014-07-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1104768","reviewer_id":"13625477","reviewer_name":"David","comments":"The unit is in nice condition and all was as described in there.

We arrived in Waikiki ready to check in at 3pm, but after contacting Roger, he claimed the rental was being cleaned and would be ready in another hour. After wandering the streets for an hour, we met Roger at his office, where he began the conversation with “do you know what Hawaiian time is?” and proceeded to make some disparaging remarks regarding Polynesian culture. The apartment and parking space was finally ready at 7:30pm, VERY late. The apartment itself was clean enough, but the dishes were dirty, and the walls were caulked all over, as it seemed the apartment was in the midst of repairs. There were a couple of roaches in the kitchen- which is expected in an older unit/building. Roger also initially said that his handyman would be coming by to paint the apartment while we were using it, which was an unreasonable request. Fortunately, he later notified us that he rescheduled the work. The beds were comfortable and the rooms were pretty spacious, but overall we wouldn't recommend staying at this rental due to the poor service and inconvenience. Not issues you want to be dealing with when you’re on vacation.

The flat is very comfortable for 4 with a fantastic view of Waikiki. On Friday evenings between 7.45-8pm, the balcony has the great view of the fireworks. The flat is 7 minutes walk from the beach. \r\n\r\nWhen we arrived from LA, we already knew that the flat will not be ready as the last guests just left for the day. Roger was accommodating by making arrangements in letting us leave our luggages in his office while we head out for lunch. We never met Roger. We only met Karl who was very helpful in driving us and our hefty luggages to Royal Kuhio. He even  specifically showed us how to use the shower in the master room.\r\n\r\nKarl shared in our chats that the previous guests left a mess and the cleaner needed more time to turn it around so my entire family was very mindful of troubling them. we left the entire house in the same condition as we found it. we even helped washed the towels along with own laundry to minimise their clean up. A day after I returned, i got a nasty message from Roger saying that  i washed his towels in bleach and destroyed it. I was shocked as the towels were washed with our laundry and if we destroyed the towels, our clothing would have been affected too. He then accused us of not following directions for the shower use and that the damages would take dollars to repair. Using the shower is not rocket science since Karl showed us how to, we didn't even use the jacuzzi. When I asked Roger and mailed Karl to clarify, i did not get any response. This left me thinking if my family was mistaken for the previous guests and maligned because my mum is a fastidious cleaner. I asked for evidence of damage but received no reply. \r\n\r\nWe had a lovely time in Hawaii and this was going to go down as a memorable family trip but this experience after the end of our trip left a bitter taste.

Just be prepared for potential issues (other reviewers have noted some difficulties). Overall I would say my experience was fine, just strange.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n-Three blocks from the beach\r\n-Central to the Waikiki area\r\n-Incredible view\r\n-Furniture, TV, and bedrooms are nice\r\n-Plenty of towels and extra sheets\r\n-Clean\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n-Was told four minutes before scheduled check-in through Airbnb communications that the place wouldn't be ready for another hour (which ended up being an hour and twenty). A phone call would have been better for how close we were to check-in time, and earlier warning would have allowed us to plan better. An hour later we tried to get the keys from the lockbox and it was empty. We went in the office to see if we could get help, but the only one in there was a doctor using the office and in the middle of an appointment. Which is fine, but strange. We called our contact who acted as middle-man to the cleaner with the keys. Again, this is fine, but was weird that we had to prompt for the keys, instead of them communicating to us the situation proactively.\r\n-Got keys and guidance from the cleaner, a very stressed out woman in a bathing suit, which was just kind of a surreal experience\r\n-We ran out of toilet paper within a day and a half, they only left two small rolls per bathroom with no extra left there. This was just a weird thing to have happen, and there is only one place we found nearby that had toilet paper for a dollar a roll. \r\n-This is much more like a hotel room than an Airbnb that feels lived in. This is either a pro or a con depending on who you are. A place that someone also uses as a home is generally better appointed, with spices for cooking your own food, some basics in the fridge, better beach gear, etc.\r\n-Communication with Roger just felt more like someone running a professional operation, polite but not warm. To be fair, this isn't really a con, it just stood in contrast to our previous experience.\r\n\r\nAny one of these things in isolation would be fine, and really not worth noting. But together, they kind of just made the experience feel weird."},{"_id":"24045563","date":{"$date":"2014-12-18T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1104768","reviewer_id":"1805151","reviewer_name":"Kerrie","comments":"Roger's responded promptly to my request and questions and the keys were easy to collect.\r\nThe apartment is centrally located with a great view, close to the beach, tour/shuttle/bus stops.

There were also a lot of Hawaii vacation gear in the master closet- Scuba gear for 2 people, bamboo mats for the beach, towels, sun umbrella, boogie boards, cooler, etc. That was wonderful- we didn't have to spend money buying those things. Only caveat is that this is not the usual AIRBNB experience, it was very clear that the apt is strictly a rental property and Roger oversees MANY apts in the area. If you are looking for a friendly- get to know you- get recommendations- AIRBNB experience, this is not for you. There were also some critters in the kitchen- although that is expected for that age of building. The rooms were very clean, and we didn't have any insect problems there.

We had 3 adults, used the kitchen for breakfast half our stay and used the washer at the end of the trip so we aren't coming home with no clean clothes. The view from the balcony was fantastic, never even touched the tv as all time in the room was spent looking out over the water. Everything was clean, pillows were comfortable which can make or break a hotel bed. Beach towels and mats were provided as were toiletries.\n\nFor the location you can't beat it, we had a rental but the bus stop was right outside, Starbucks across the street, a great pancake place 1 block away for bfast, great ramen also 2 block away. On the way to the beach is affordable shopping and food, check out nanas for the best mochi parfait ever. On the other side ala wai river is great to walk in the morning during sunrise.\n\nThe only downsides were as such, both out of Rogers control:\nWaikiki has roaches everywhere, No avoiding them, and you will spot a few smaller ones in the kitchen early in the morning but they're small and harmless. Never stayed at a hotel in Waikiki that didn't have them.\nIf you're a fitness freak like me the fitness center in the building is very basic, but it's enough to get by on a rainy day. There's no treadmill but this can easily be remedied by heading outside before sunrise and running up ala wai towards diamond head, pay the $1 walk in admission and jog up to the top of diamond head to watch the sunrise, then jog back to the hotel for bfast. (Pro-tip for diamond head, at the top go right up the endless staircase then continue up the spiral staircase to come out in a bunker and climb out onto the path to see the sun. All the tourists go left up the easier path. This makes a difference of sharing the view with 2 other people vs 200)."},{"_id":"137845713","date":{"$date":"2017-03-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1104768","reviewer_id":"95353550","reviewer_name":"Jade Marie","comments":"Great location!

There is security in the lobby and a bell cart if you need help with bags. The home was neat and orderly. Wifi instructions, as well as house rules, were located on the counter. Plenty of space and pictures were accurate. However, we did find a few maintenance issues such as a broken futon leg, loose screws for the dresser, and cockroaches in the kitchen. Roger was able to address my concerns and sent someone to try and fix the problems. Over all, I feel we paid slightly more than the true value of the home. The roaches were definitely a turn off.

We asked for a vacuum-cleaner and a can-opener and both items were delivered to us in less than an hour.\n\nAir-conditioning: all rooms have air-conditioning (though they’re quite loud, so if you’re a light sleeper like me, you won’t be able to have them on while you sleep).\n\nCONS\nCleanliness: considering that the Cleaning Fee is so expensive ($400+), the apartment wasn’t that clean when we arrived. Kitchen and bathroom cabinets were dirty, floors hadn’t been mopped (just vacuumed), the balcony was visibly dirty and messy and the dishwasher hadn’t been cleaned in years, I had to clean it myself before using it.\n\nInfestation: the kitchen was infested with cockroaches. We tidied the kitchen every night before bed, leaving no crumbs on the bench and no dirty plates in the sink, yet every morning there were cockroaches all over the bench and all over the clean dishes.\nWe also found a few cockroaches in one of the bedrooms.\n\nExtra Bedding: the sofa bed mattresses are very thin and uncomfortable to sleep on. You can feel the springs poking into your back.\n\nNoise: I mentioned in PROS that the air-conditioning vents are quite loud and so is the street noise. Even though the apartment is on the 34th floor, the street noise echoes up and you can hear cars, car horns, sirens and nightclub music.\n\nGym: the gym facilities are very small and the equipment is very dated. We ended up paying money to use a proper gym.\n\nLate Check-out Fee: host is not flexible with check-out time, unless you pay a $150 Late Check-out Fee. I’ve never experienced this on AirBnB before.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIf you’re looking for a well positioned apartment to accomodate a large group of people in Waikiki, to mainly sleep, shower and have the occasional quick breakfast in, then this might be the place for you.\nBut if you have kids and/or need to be in the apartment for longer periods of time and/or need to cook main meals (lunch or dinner), and/or need a late check-out, then this apartment might not be right for you.\n\n"},{"_id":"150342767","date":{"$date":"2017-05-07T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1104768","reviewer_id":"30879057","reviewer_name":"James","comments":"Fantastic place to stay.

I then, unfortunately, didn't factor in the budget of other guests and went ahead and booked it. I sent a private message asking Roger to clarify the cancellation policy and his response was unnecessarily snotty. I can deal with the cancellation policy, but I do not appreciate being talked to like I'm an idiot. \n\nWhen getting the instructions for the house key, it gets a bit confusing. There are tons of lock boxes in the same area and not much distinction between them. After that, I couldn't get into the apartment. After traveling many many hours and being delayed, I'm frustrated. After calling at 11pm the 3 contact numbers with no answer we finally figured out the access code with the security man's help! I received a call at 430AM finally. \n\nThe apartment is a nice size. 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms with 2 balcony's. Unfortunately, the balcony attached to the bedroom was not usable as the door was off the tracks and it was hard to open/close. \n\nThe apartment is in need of a deep cleaning. I don't fault the cleaning crew for this, as it's more than they're paid to take care of, I'm sure.\n\nKeeping a rental property requires upkeep and I understand now why the past reviews all say the rental is \"outdated\". For the price of this unit, I honestly would have preferred a cleaner, smaller apartment without the roaches and worrying if the owner would accuse me of breaking the ice maker that refused to work. \n\nIf you'll look at reviews, the owner is defensive and rude in his replies. This is unacceptable in my opinion.

We had many a drink on the balcony just admiring the view including the sunset.  We had 6 adults and a 1 year old staying and that was comfortable with one couple sleeping on the pullout beds in the living area. Communication up to our stay was fantastic and instructions on entry excellent. We only had to make communication once with owners re a minor matter and that was dealt with quickly over the phone. Apartment is starting to get worn in places so in need of some maintenance but nothing that ruined our stay in any way. It  was in a great location with a bus stop right outside. It was noisy if you had the outside sliding doors open as the avenue below was a busy one. But you get used to that and you can close the doors to block it out. If you have you children don't worry about the 34th floor balcony. It is quite safe as there is a wall around it so children can't climb through or climb over. \nI would certainly go back and recommend it for families or groups of people"},{"_id":"255516379","date":{"$date":"2018-04-20T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1104768","reviewer_id":"172265506","reviewer_name":"Nicole","comments":"Great central location in the middle of Waikiki!"},{"_id":"257340036","date":{"$date":"2018-04-25T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1104768","reviewer_id":"7579837","reviewer_name":"Jaison","comments":"This place has a plot of potential but it appears management has just not been diligent in taking care of it as I had expected.  Unfortunately we had problems from the outset.  First they gave us the wrong code to the combination door lock and we could not get inside until we got a hold of the cleaning crew.  Secondly the dishwasher was not working and small roaches were found inside.  The roaches were a common problem throughout our stay.  Small roaches were found everywhere, in the sink, on the couches, and elsewhere in the house.  They did come and spray/lay out bait stations while we were there but this also inconvenienced us since we had to wait for them to arrive in the morning.  The lights were not working in one bedroom. On top of that both sliding doors were off the tracks making the first night quite warm since all the AC was escaping.  Next we had plumbing issues where the master sink was not draining and then another cartidge had to be replaced in the master shower.  The building subsequently had a leak and they had to enter the condo while we were gone.  The good things were the views, location, parking, and he issued us a 15% credit for the inconvenience."},{"_id":"263009867","date":{"$date":"2018-05-10T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1104768","reviewer_id":"1489193","reviewer_name":"Charlie","comments":"The place is just how described.

Major cleanliness issues throughout. We encountered hair in sinks, grimy taps, dirty floors, and dirty dishes.  And it didn’t end there. Basic maintenance is being neglected. We expected handles on all the kitchen cupboards, sliding doors to close and *lock*, a mould-free fridge and air conditioner, a rust-free microwave, a coffee maker without old coffee grounds, and working light bulbs — but that’s not what we found when we walked in. The microwave, coffee maker and light bulbs were replaced but only when we raised concerns. Why should it have to come to that?\n\nAnd except for the view and location we felt the photos were misleading. They were definitely not taken recently. The lack of care and effort in maintaining the place is shameful. The unit is very run down and I get the impression nobody really cares.  It is evidently clear the view and location sell themselves but that’s not all we paid for.  This place is way overpriced for what you get — and we’ve been to Hawaii 6 times.

I do believe the cleaners did the best with what they had to work with, but the state of the apartment was shocking. The curtains were falling down in the living room and the lining of all the curtains was completely deteriorated and falling apart. All of the furniture in the living room and second bedroom was tired and looked like it was around 20 years old. The lanai had loose boards, very tired furniture, bad tile, and random beach articles piled in the corner. The air conditioning units were nailed in place with unfinished wooden boards, and the AC in the master would run for around 5 minutes and then had to be reset at the fuse box. \n\nThe bathrooms, especially the tubs, tile and grout were old and dingy with a lot of visible wear and tear. \n\nChipped paint, banged up or missing baseboards, spotty touch up efforts and a general state of dilapidation would round out the description of this accommodation. Not value for money."}]}

location in a charming old building, the room is quite modern and clean.  The room is relatively small and cosy but sufficient for 2 guests as we were out most of the time. Strong Wi-Fi. Love that there are many power points to charge our gadgets. Well air-conditioned. Basic bath amenities are provided but towels are not quite absorbent. Water heater works well. Could do with a floor mat outside the bathroom, and a few clothes hooks/hangers and a full length mirror mounted on the room wall. There was also slight flooding in the toilet after a bath but didn't take too long for the water to drain. Doors are secured by digital locks so it saves the hassle of carrying keys around. Bed is quite hard and the pillows too soft but not too much of a problem. There were stains on the bedsheet though. \r\n\r\nLocation wise, very convenient. Just directly above Jordan MTR exit B1. Airport bus A22 is just a few minutes walk away. There are Circle K and 7-11 downstairs.  \r\n\r\nTungshing was generally helpful with our queries and gave clear instructions for the passwords and how to get to the apartment. He was easily contactable and replied very promptly via Airbnb messenger and (Hidden by Airbnb) . Appreciated his flexibility in extending an early check-in and late check-out as we had an early flight in and late flight out.  \r\n\r\nAll in all, value for money and would definitely recommend!

All in all, the basics were all provided for (lots of outlets, good a/c, hot water, etc.), the room was quite clean, and the bed was comfortable enough. As is typical with Hong Kong spaces, the bathroom is quite small, so if you're on the tall/big side, this may prove to be a bit of a challenge. Also, if you're a light sleeper, you'll want to note that this room is by the main door, so you will hear other guests entering and leaving. If this doesn't bother you, then you'll be fine.

A bath mat would be a great improvement, as the toilet and shower are in the same tiny space. The bed is not long. If you are 5'10, maybe you can't stretch out all the way. The lock to your apartment is just a passcode that is laughably insecure. I'll put it this way- if you know the password to your room, you can deduce the passcode to all the other rooms.\r\n\r\nOverall- if the passwords were more secure, the mildew smell cleaned, and the toilet seat was fixed, then I'd stay here again because it's a nice location and a nice room.

The checkin time was 4pm and if you're early it's possible to message Tungshing to be able to leave your luggage in the corridor outside the room, it's not watched but it's behind the first of two passcode locked doors so any of the inhabitants of the other four or five apartments could access it. I left my luggage from about 11am until about 4.20 and then I returned to check in. When I opened the door the room was still I cleaned from the previous occupants. I messaged him to check and he said he was on the way and asked me to leave and then come back again after 20 minutes. I thought it was a bit weird that I, as the customer had to let him know that it needed cleaning. The toilet is a little bit odd because it's only possible to sit on it sideways. There were two towels, shower gel and shampoo in the bathroom which is good. There was only one partial roll of toilet paper for two people for a seven night stay - we ended up buying more after a day or two. The room is definitely a good size for Hong Kong, (in that it's large enough to stand up and stretch your arms out which is almost a luxury), and it matched the photo in the add - however there weren't any chairs to sit on or hooks to hang up coats which seemed a bit strange given that there would have been space for some. The photo of the room online had a photo of a hairdryer but when I arrived there wasn't one. One of us has long hair so that was kind of a bummer. This is kind of normal for Hong Kong, but the bed is small, a 'Hong Kong Queen', which is small even for us (and we're both female). The duvet is likewise a Hong Kong Queen sized one so whenever one of turned over in the night, the other was left uncovered. The bed size is kind of standard for this type of place, but it's also normal for this size bed to be paired with a slightly bigger duvet so that both sleepers can move around a little. Again, this is another common complaint for Hong Kong, but the walls are incredibly thin. We were lucky enough to have quiet neighbours for most nights but there was a noisy couple in there for two or three nights. It would be better to bring earplugs if you find it hard to sleep with noise, (this would also help block out the sound of the other doors and the street noises coming through the thin windows). If location and room size are your priorities, then this is a great choice. It's very conveniently located and the size..."},{"_id":"139342955","date":{"$date":"2017-03-24T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11055163","reviewer_id":"111194406","reviewer_name":"Jake","comments":"it was little bit more good as much as price.

I am 5'11\" and my feet were touching the wall at the end of the bed, I just slept diagonally but this is something to consider if there are two of you.\n\nThe passcode door locks worked fine, with one code for the hallway and one for the room, I heard a lot of people getting confused and trying to use their room code on the outer door though so this could be made clearer in the check in info.\n\nThe bathroom is a wet room with the shower in the middle, this worked fine for me but using a pair of flip flops was needed so I didn't get the apartment wet. There was a bit of an ant issue, there would be a few in and around the sink every day, also the shampoo dispenser was dripping so I had to put a mug under it. As mentioned in other reviews the toilet seat is broken, this is a quick fix that should be done, also the sink tap had no hot water hooked up to it so I had to use the shower for that.\n\nOverall a good value room for a central location, if the maintenance issues were taken care of I would give it a 5 out of 5."},{"_id":"346809214","date":{"$date":"2018-11-10T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11055163","reviewer_id":"115875078","reviewer_name":"悦","comments":"房东热情好客 指导如何入住 很详细 \n房子就在佐敦B2出口 交通方便 \n房间很漂亮 适合年轻人 \n性价比很高"},{"_id":"349620739","date":{"$date":"2018-11-18T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11055163","reviewer_id":"154770553","reviewer_name":"Kwanshing","comments":"Nice day"},{"_id":"404425709","date":{"$date":"2019-01-24T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11055163","reviewer_id":"234268352","reviewer_name":"浩","comments":"好房源"},{"_id":"404950076","date":{"$date":"2019-01-26T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11055163","reviewer_id":"142466215","reviewer_name":"Vijay","comments":"很不錯,除了坐便器是壞的｡"},{"_id":"405960586","date":{"$date":"2019-01-28T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11055163","reviewer_id":"134792250","reviewer_name":"상범","comments":"조던역 B1출구에서 바로 앞 건물이어서 찾기 쉬우나 건물이 진짜 옛날 건물이어서 다소 위험해보이고, 청결하지 않아요.\n가격이 싸니까 그정도는 만족했는데 솔직히 수건이 너무너무너무 부족해요.. 2박인데 수건 1개..

Before the trip, we were given immediate and friendly response from host and on the day of our arrival, she came to pick us up at the nearest bus stop, where we took a direct cityflyer bus from the Airport as per our host's guidance.\r\n\r\nApt was tidy, clean, cosy and comfortable for our three nights stay. Host even provided snacks/tidbits and several drink mix. There were bedroom slippers, electric kettle, microwave, cups, bowls and utensils, TV, basic toiletries and hairdryer. We were told that the temperature of the aircon could not be adjusted but that did not affect us at all because the temperature was just right throughout our stay during the rainy season period. \r\n\r\nWe were also given a precise mini tour of what was in the apt and how we could use the very convenient sofa bed (which we didn't use in the end because the third person did not stay with us). There's wifi in the apt as well. However, we did experience some connection issues with the TV on one night which we gave up after awhile when we couldn't watch the few channels we wanted to. \r\n\r\nIt's a very quiet building located extremely convenient to the MTR, just 2 minutes walk to the nearest exit (and probably another 5-8 mins walk before you reach the MTR gantry). Right across the building on the ground floor there are two popular cafes and one ice cream shop that I would highly recommend and they need no introduction, just (Hidden by Airbnb) it if you're a fellow cafehopper/dessert person. \r\n\r\nIt is also very near the k11 mall, an art mall that I loved a lot and even managed to check out the Urban Sense art exhibition for free! (Because we snapped a photo of the exhibition board and posted it on our social media accounts but thankfully we went in for free as there were nothing much in there and we were basically out in 15 minutes. But still, do check it out if you happen to be there and follow the instructions to get the free entrance!)\r\n\r\nAt the end of our stay, our host even surprised with a little gift - a box of Jenny Bakery cookies, which we really appreciated a lot :)\r\n\r\nOverall, it's a nice, cosy little apt for 2-3 pax accommodation in Hong Kong and definitely cheaper but value-for-money alternative compared to hotel stay. It was smaller than I had imagined since I have only stayed in hotel during all my trips to HK located on the Hong Kong island but truth be told, I wouldn't mind heading back to book my stay with Michelle\u0026May, probably check out their other listings which are all also located on Kowloon :)"},{"_id":"71807282","date":{"$date":"2016-04-28T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11093339","reviewer_id":"30073582","reviewer_name":"Phan","comments":"The location is great. 7eleven and Wellcome are just in front of your flat.

She has thoughtful touches such as drinks in the fridge and things that you may need such as chargers, hair dryer etc.  You have everything that you need for short stay in Hong Kong here. The only thing that I would mention is that the building is a bit noisy at night. If you're a very light sleeper like me then you might find difficult to sleep.

We were hesitant about staying in Kowloon because it is considered less fashionable than HK Island by some, but there were designer stores just 3 minutes walking away, a metro by the same distance, and we never felt unsafe. The only complaint I have is that it was at times noisy, so you might want to bring earplugs for sleeping. The space is small, but it seemed typical of HK apartment sizes and standards. It was a tight fit but a fit nonetheless. Michelle and May were really helpful with checkin and giving us recommendations and directions. The bakery across the street is delicious and there is a 7-Eleven up the street for snacks. There are lots of restaurants around, too. Definitely recommend!

To start off, the location, cleanliness inside of the apt, and of course the price are all great. However, there was little to no hot water and when visiting in January, was on its own not worth the cheap price. You have to turn on the heater to heat to water for at least 10 minutes but even then, the hot water is not that hot and it runs out after a few minutes leaving you showering in freezing water for half of your shower. We were also only given 2 towels and for a 3 night stay for 2, this was not really enough. And the wifi connection is very weak, can't really watch videos without buffering. And finally, while the inside of the apartment is clean, the apartment building itself is very run down and I wouldn't consider the apartment itself new (like the title of the listing suggests)."},{"_id":"402625566","date":{"$date":"2019-01-19T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11093339","reviewer_id":"76200808","reviewer_name":"May","comments":"it is exactly how the picture is.everything was set before we arrived.

It was also near Temple St, Australia Dairy Company, Mak's Noodle. \n\n2) CLEAN.  The room looks new. (Although the bldg itself looks old.)\n\n3) has own bathroom, tv (no remote), hot shower, water heater, slippers, shampoo, body wash, dental kit, adaptor\n\n4) AFFORDABLE\n\n5) owner was quick to answer our queries through airbnb messenger\n\nCons: \n1) we experienced 1 day without toilet flush, the tank was not refilling water-- owner said it was bldg pipes problem.  So we just put the shower head into the toilet tank to use the flush.  It was back the next day.\n\n\nMinor comments:\nReally small space, although we knew that when we booked this place.  Only 1 person can pass through the space beside the bed.  Bathroom is tight too, shower is almost on top of the toilet.

While space is tiny, I gather, all space is tight and expensive in Kowloon.  We were happy to have workable accomodations at this price point!

Но есть два момента, которые стоит на мой взгляд знать путешественнику, который никогда не был в Гонконге. Первое - комната расположена в Гонконгском жилом небоскрёбе, рядом с метро в оживлённом районе города. Это значит - найти легко, добраться отсюда можно легко и удобно в любую точку города, но подъезд и само здание будут грязные, днём запахи китайской еды из окна и под вашей комнатой будут вечно шататься какие-то типы. В комнате и холле чисто, есть чайник, полотенца, фен, тапочки. Душевой шланг висит в туалете. Фото соответствует действительности. В общем неплохо.

The apartment itself was accurately described. However, the power went out in the apartment for a few hours during 1 of my days. I noticed a note left by the utility company saying that the tenant was late on a bill and they had cut off power. It took me about 1-2 hours before host showed up to address the problem. He said it was a mistake of the utility company but I saw him take a screw driver to the electrical meter in the stairwell. Speaking of the stairwell, you'll have to use it to get up and down the building otherwise you'll wait 10-15 minutes to use the elevator as there are tons of people waiting to use the single elevator for the building. On more than one occasion, I saw rats and roaches running freely and people smoking cigarettes in the stairwells.\n\nWhen I showed up the apartment, I ran into a guy who stayed in the room/apartment the day before I arrived. He was just loitering in the hallway of the apartment and he told he was flying out of HK tomorrow. He ended up staying the entire night in the hallway on the floor using the apartment Wifi. The guy has the code to the room, which was unsettling.\n\nLast thing, the electronic door lock to my room was broken. My room was never locked as a result.\n\nGood luck."},{"_id":"195004778","date":{"$date":"2017-09-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11095139","reviewer_id":"146698263","reviewer_name":"Matt","comments":"great location"},{"_id":"200018339","date":{"$date":"2017-10-03T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11095139","reviewer_id":"72639937","reviewer_name":"Cor","comments":"Great stay.

It’s close to shopping places, food restaurants, and the Temple street night market."},{"_id":"267823442","date":{"$date":"2018-05-23T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11095139","reviewer_id":"153583493","reviewer_name":"Joanne","comments":"方便"},{"_id":"270963460","date":{"$date":"2018-05-31T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11095139","reviewer_id":"192218708","reviewer_name":"Alejandra","comments":"Great place to stay if you are traveling light.

The food selection is supposed to be great (too bad we didn't get to try any). There is a grocery store right outside the building.

Also i didn't like the fact in the closet it was 7 roaches on a trap that made me think he have roaches in the house and this made me to keep all my luggage close until my stay ended but overall we had a pleasant stay. This apartment doesn't have TV but it does have WiFi but you don't really need a TV if you visit New York because so much to do there. Also his apartment is located in urban neighborhood which fill with different Ethnic group mostly Latino and Blacks. His apartment  is located on 4th floor of the building no elevator only stairs so just be prepared to walk a lot stairs.  The hallway are dirty and I saw people smoking and drinking which I didn't like as well. Also people hang out in from of the building but no way said or did anything to us. Next door neighbor who is deaf with kids are very loud and stay up and make noise all night so be prepared to listen to noise neighbors\nOverall I had a wonderful time and new York despite the little mishap on arrival but the host himself is a very nice person but I probably won't be staying at this location anymore just because the building, loudness and the neighbors."},{"_id":"93433319","date":{"$date":"2016-08-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11097962","reviewer_id":"30435900","reviewer_name":"Darina","comments":"Kevin is an excellent host, the apartment is very clean and match the pictures.

He was very friendly and helpful. He even offered clear directions on how to get to his place as well as maps in order to get around. My only advice for people staying here in the future is that although Kevin's place is nice and well-kept, the location is still in East Harlem and it can get a little sketchy and dangerous (especially at night). This location is right opposite the projects (it is important to note that it is not the safest area).

It was exactly how you described and very easy to travel around the city especially if you were looking to commute as I was. Kevin checked on me throughout my stay and was where he said he would be right when he said he would be there. I'm big on food so I'd suggest Amy Ruth's for breakfast. The chicken and waffles are incredible and you can walk there if you want to take in Harlem no problem or get driven there by a ride share for 5 bucks. It's great if you are going to explore the city and just want somewhere to hang your head. So very clean also.

The air conditioner is fairly loud, so if you have issues with noise make sure to bring ear plugs if you'll want the air on at night.  The apartment is actually quite quiet otherwise, surprisingly, but we got pretty unlucky our second night: one of the neighbors had a very loud group of guests or party making noises well into the early morning. Again, make sure you have ear plugs, but that's always a good idea for cities.

Kevin was at work when I tried to book so communication was slow. When we did meet at the apartment, he was very hospitable and kind. The apartment is in a good location, close to many restaurants and a vibrant city day/night life. I'd stay in this apartment again, great location and was cool for what I needed it for at the time.\n\nNo high expectations of this apartment but if you're just dropping your bags and hitting the streets then this is just what you need.

Neither of which I am. I came for an overnight stay on a business trip  - also the description says it is appropriate for business travelers, and it IS NOT. There are no business style amenities besides WiFi.  There are no desks or even night stands to put and charge your phone. There were also a lof of personal items still visible. \n\nIt was very clean, but had a lot of perfume smells, so if you are sensitive, beware. \n\nThe main issue with this place is the noise. When I arrived Kevin told me that it was just \"New York apartment noise and that his neighbors are deaf so they can be a little loud to communicate with each other.\" This was a FAR cry from the truth. The neighbors  are OUT OF CONTROL LOUD!!! And have waaaay more issues than being deaf.  I got in at 7 p.m. and almost immediately there were what sounded like physical flights, banging on the doors and walls both inside and in the hallways, shouting, screaming, loud music, running up and down the stairs until 7 a.m.!!!! It was like I was in the middle of a wrestling ring all night long! The walls are super thin and you can hear everything! It was like they were in the apartment. \n\nIt was singularly the most horrible HORRIFIC sleeping experience of my life. You cannot get away from the noise, and it is VIOLENT and ABUSIVE. \n\nOnly stay here if you can sleep like a baby on an airplane runway."},{"_id":"413435652","date":{"$date":"2019-02-17T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11097962","reviewer_id":"131340451","reviewer_name":"Eric","comments":"Kevin was a great host.

The room itself was very quaint and small but great for what I needed which was just a place to stay.  The bathroom is Korean style where the shower is basically part of the bathroom as a whole and not separate but definitely worth while as it's your own private bathroom.  \r\nWould definitely suggest is to anyone looking for a great cheap place to stay for the weekend and just exploring the city.

I contacted them and they offered me a free night in another floor they told me they had recently refurbished, the give you a code for the door lock, I was surprised when iIfound its the same code as the week before, how safe could this be? Anyway they messaged me twice to ask if I'm coming, iItold them Yes, but I was outside with some customers, who were also attending the exhibition, eventually after a very long day I arrived at the room at 1am, code did not work cannot get in, tried to call and message them, no answer left and a few minutes later they send me another code, so return to the place, new code won't work either, so it's now 1:30 in the morning and I need to find a new hotel, cost 2000HKD, so I'm sorry even though the people seemed very nice, I would not recommend this place!

He is really nice, sweet and on top of everything. He texted me a few days before my check in and walked me through step by step from public transportation (how to get to the airbnb from airport) to self checked in. Sam was very patient to answer every single question. When I arrived Hong Kong, he even texted me and make sure I got to the place ok.\n\nThe room was slightly smaller than I thought, however, it's perfectly for one. And come on, it is Hong Kong, everywhere is tiny in there. The room has everything I needed including comfy bed, blackout curtains, ac, shampoo, body wash, hair dryer, adapters, etc. I have requested for extra pillow and Sam has delivered. Room is very clean and there is a housekeeper to clean each room everyday. As a clean freak, his room is totally meet my standard with thumbs up. The only thing I wish about hot water situation could last more than 5mins. Every night I have to rush trough during shower because of hot water doesn't last. It could be the weather has dropped while I was visiting HK and I'm sure it's perfectly fine from spring to fall. \n\nLocation is safe, only couple mins walk from mtr (subway). It takes you anywhere you need to go in HK. 7-11 is right next to the building. Jordan area is extremely convenient and has so much good food around. I would definitely return on my next visit. \n\nThank you so much Sam!!

The place is located not too far from the famous night market in Kowloon. There are also rooftop bars in hotels near the place where you could sip a drink and take in the HK view. There's a 7-eleven downstairs which is nice. Not to forget to mention that Jordan station is so close and so is the stop for the airport bus. The size is expected for the price I paid. I didn't like was how the blanket felt my first night. I communicated it with the host and he looked into it. Not sure if it changed but I was tired the second night anyway. Also, the sink was insanely small. Even smaller than other small hotels I've stayed in before. Nonetheless, the place is pretty new and conveniently located.

I looked at a lot of Airbnbs online and I also saw two others that my friends stayed at. I made the right choice :) \n\nThis is a good room and Sam is a great host. Sam was easy to get in touch with and went the extra mile to make sure check-in was straightforward and simple. He stayed in touch to make sure everything was good, and he was responsive to messages and requests to get a towel, leave my luggage in the room after check-in, and answer questions about bus routes. \n\nThe room itself is as small as the picture suggests, but it is well-lit during the day, all the furniture is nice, the room is well decorated, and because it's on the 10th floor, it's relatively quiet (for Hong Kong). It is on a main road, but the window faces a quieter street. You will, however, hear your neighbors come and go (but this is probably unavoidable at this budget). The cleaners come in the afternoons. The bed is comfortable and the A/C is adjustable and quiet as well. \n\nIf you are travelling with others, perhaps request multiple rooms on this floor, if possible. From the elevator, there is a hall with a door that leads to a small \"lobby\", which acts as a hall to about four or five other similar rooms. My friends stayed at Airbnbs that were very close and had a little more square footage, but they didn't have the nice atmosphere that this room had. The Muji decor is a nice touch. \n\nAlso, there is Starbucks, Saint's Ape (boba shop), and 7-Eleven all on the same block. Great local food within blocks. And the A22 bus (to and from the airport) is also very convenient.

Las respuestas llegaban rápido y con toda la información necesaria.  Luego después de reservar, Sam estuvo en constante comunicación conmigo, dándome indicaciones muy útiles sobre cómo llegar al alojamiento y cómo hospedarme, así como también recomendaciones sobre la ciudad.  La habitación, es lo típico en espacio que uno podría esperar en Hong Kong, área sumamente reducida, sin embargo todo está muy bien distribuido y limpio.  Sam también te provee de adaptadores para conectar tus aparatos eléctricos, y lo que muestran las fotografías de la habitación es exacto lo que encontrarás en ellas.  La veracidad es altamente apreciada. La ubicación del alojamiento también es excelente, puesto que está en el centro de Kowloon, a pocos pasos de estaciones de metro y varias rutas de autobús.  También se puede llegar caminando a los muelles.

We could change our check-out in the last day of our stay without problems. Jon arranged this in an uncomplicated manner.\r\n\r\nThe flat is very nice and functional furnished. All equipment is very new. The beds have comfortable mattresses in which we could sleep very well. In striking distance you will find bars and shops frequented by residents. Even the view from the small balcony over the roofs of Barcelona is a visit worth. A breath-taking view in Barcelona’s real life!\r\n\r\nWe recommend this apartment without retention and will rent it again for our next stay in this unique town.

None of this bothered us and we really appreciated this classy space for a slow start every morning and to come back to and enjoy every night. \n\nI wish we'd stayed longer!"},{"_id":"193333081","date":{"$date":"2017-09-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11108923","reviewer_id":"811629","reviewer_name":"Diane","comments":"Ana was great at checking us in and showing us around.

Vi provade några och det visade sig vara toppen!\nUtöver detta var värden oerhört gullig och erbjöd sig att komma med medicin när jag blev sjuk!

The neighborhood has fantastic dining----many great Tapas places right on the same street.--- and is only a 5 to 10 min walk to the metro which will take you anywhere in the city! Download the \"moovit\" App for public transportation. It's much more useful than the Maps App if you want to use the metro (which I recommend)  You are also walking distance to Montjuic Castle  and park which is very fun! The Tram that takes you to the beach is also located in that area. You can also walk to  Las Ramblas or take the metro one stop. Super convenient location. The Flat was very clean, comfortable spacious and quiet. The pictures featured are accurate.  It is on the 4th floor w/ no lift----so keep that in mind if you have any physical problems getting around. But if you're in normal good health it's no problem at all!!  The Flat has everything you need for an easy stay. Full Kitchen w/ basics like salt pepper oil coffee etc.  Washer , Hair dryer Shampoo soap towels etc. The Terrace is very nice to enjoy a cup of coffee or glass of wine. Anna was prompt and easy to communicate with---she even called us a cab for our final trip to the Airport! She also provided a detailed map and an extensive travel guide w/ a  list of restaurants, bars, shopping, tourist attractions and a break down of the various neighborhoods!! We referred to her guide many times during our stay!  All in all this is a fantastic place to explore Barcelona from!

Comfortable beds, good black out curtains and good air conditioning.  I'd say the only small negative is due to the fact it's an older building, you can hear the neighbours above walking around and when the bedroom doors are fully closed, the rooms can get warm.  But the easy solution is leave the bedroom doors open to access the AC.  Hosts were very friendly!   A nice little balcony  to sit and enjoy a drink.

Easy walk to metro in 5mins. The instructions on how to get to accomodation and the process is super clear and professional. Call as soon as you land as taxi only takes max 20 mins. Appeared that host is not the actual home owner but rather part of a management company - not relevant for appartment. Kitchen had all utensils required but no basics such as sugar,salt etc. Good space in the appartment for a group and a great sitting room. Take note of late arrival charges - they are communicated in listing.

This was certainly unpleasant, but i guess it could happen anywhere.\r\n3. as others mentioned, sometimes smells were noticed in the bathrooms - it happened randomly through the day. i guess the building;s vent systems are not great.\r\n\r\nagain, these were minor things. we felt very comfortable otherwise. we also really appreciated the view and the location. the beds were comfortable too."},{"_id":"117165169","date":{"$date":"2016-12-05T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1111410","reviewer_id":"44091114","reviewer_name":"Kristina","comments":"Perfect location at 5 min walk from Plaça Espagna, beautiful view, clean rooms, a very good experience!"},{"_id":"123670673","date":{"$date":"2016-12-30T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1111410","reviewer_id":"72348179","reviewer_name":"Jorge V.","comments":"Casa amplia y cómoda con excelente ubicación"},{"_id":"124931863","date":{"$date":"2017-01-03T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1111410","reviewer_id":"95885819","reviewer_name":"Philippe","comments":"Ne cherchez pas le 1 de la rue, c'est au 1 bis. retard de l'hôte et accueil assez glacial.

She is respectful of one's privacy but always ready to give support when asked upon. Be it in spoken or written form I always got my answers from her within no times. She also proofed to be very flexible in terms of arrival and departure times which I appreciated a great deal. If you are a fan of jazz music (like I am), make sure to double check ahead of time about her current concert dates so as not to miss your hostess on stage like I did (grumble ;-)).\n\nThe room I occupied was the smaller one of two that Isabel rents out. So if her flat is fully rented out there can be a maximum of 4 guests plus your hostess in the flat, which can cause some bathroom jam, especially during the hot and humid summer times, when the need for a cool shower is inherent to everyone's desire. \nMy room was as depicted. If you plan on using it for double occupancy, I recommend taking Isa's larger room (unless the two of you are very much in love and want to cuddle up close ;-)). Also, if you need a table for writing, ask for the larger room as well, which comes along with one.\nThe flat itself is absolutely enchanting and furnished with love and an artistic eye to details. It's location is a dream for touristic explorations with anything within walking distance. \nTherefore, I can easily recommend both Isabel and her flat to anyone wishing to immerge himself into the local customs and get a good doze of what it is like \"to live like a true Barcelonian\".  \n\nQuerida Isa, muchas gracias por tu hospedalid génial! Volveré a ciencia cierta!\nSaludos y besos\nLiliana"},{"_id":"92969637","date":{"$date":"2016-08-10T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11115528","reviewer_id":"35246459","reviewer_name":"Murat","comments":"The apartment is very centrally located, in the heart of the gothic part of the city and a couple of blocks from the Placa de Catalunya which makes transportation and sightseeing very easy. It's a 20 minute walk from the beach which is a plus. It's located in a very old building on the top floor, so it is rather stuffy and warm in the apartment. The room overlooks a very narrow street/alley so it's rather dark and it's easy to hear the noise coming from the street and the neighboring apartments. There are a few other rooms in the house that are being rented out, so other people will be staying in the house which makes it a necessity to lock the room when you leave the apartment. \n\nIt's important to note that this place has a very strict check out time. On our last day, we had an evening flight but had to check out in the morning. When we asked if we could check out late, Isa told us to take our stuff to the train station and use the lockers there, but the train station does not have lockers. We ended up renting a locker  at a place called \"Barcelona lockers\". That, I would say changed all the plans for the last day. \n\n"},{"_id":"97257513","date":{"$date":"2016-08-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11115528","reviewer_id":"121053","reviewer_name":"Mina","comments":"I was happy to experience Isabels home as described here. It was spacious, bright and original, with lovely colours and beautiful artwork surrounding me in every room. Isabel is a creative, sensitive and respectful person, with an open mind- yet she has the necessary boundaries that are required to organize an environment where so many different people are going to stay and hopefully enjoy. \nThe street itself is very lively, but the noises didn't bother me at all as i could easily block them out with earplugs. The location could not have been more sentral, still it's on \"the right side\" of the Rambla, where you can find more independent shops, restaurants, cafes and bars compared to the same leveled streets towards Raval. It is an old and very charming building, so if you want an minimalistic experience with cold, stainless steel and elevators this is not the place for you! And perhaps you are not the right person for this place either ;) I had to leave earlier due to illness, and was so sorry i couldn't stay throughout the whole month as planned.

Not hugely disappointed, not super happy. Location is amazing, space is well decorated , there were lovely Lillies in the kitchen. But although response to messages were always prompt, never that extra, friendly, caring touch. \n\nWhen I choose accommodation where I share space with the host, I choose mostly by whether I’d like to get to know this person or not. Isabel sounded very interesting, so I was looking forward to meeting her. As it turns out, she seemed pretty reluctant to interact. It felt like we were intruding on her space for the most part. For example, when she emerged from her room at 12pm, I asked her “how are you today?” Her response was “I don’t know yet.” End of conversation. Which is fine. Again, she was never rude. Just a little closed. \n\nBed was comfortable. Not really enough space to put things away. \nA little grimy. Place needs a good deep clean. \n\nIn the end, she seemed to connect a little with my adult daughter who stayed with me which I was glad for. \n\nI am reluctant to recommend this place based on my experience. Yours might be different. You’ll love the location I’m sure. Although it comes up for a cheap price on Airbnb, in the end because she charges extra for a second person and the cleaning fee is high , it was $130 cdn a night. Which is too much for this place."},{"_id":"259038985","date":{"$date":"2018-04-30T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11115528","reviewer_id":"24811174","reviewer_name":"Sander","comments":"Centrale locatie zonder geluidsoverlast s nachts.

The neighbourhood is a lively and trendy one, with plenty of cafés, bars, restaurants, theatres and concert halls to enjoy the city from breakfast to evening, either alone, in couple, with friends or with kids.","notes":"Licence number: HUTB-007120","transit":"Excellent location: subway at walking distance (3-5 minutes away to Poble Sec stop, green line (L3), which takes directly to the city centre – 4 stops to Plaza Cataluña - the Sants rail station - 3 stops - and to the Camp Nou Stadium), Plaza España/Fira de Montjuic/Aerobús stop to the airport at 10-15 minutes walking or 1 subway stop away; walking distance to the Ramblas, Raval, Sant Antoni market and Colón/Drassanes.

We stayed here for 3 nights with our two children and found it perfect. We were able to walk or take the metro everywhere we wanted to go, but have a quieter place to sleep and relax. There is a park down the street and a supermarket directly across. Xavi met us on arrival and was very nice and helpful throughout our stay. When my husband accidentally left a few things in the apartment, Xavi collected them and met us upon our return to Barcelona a few days later to return them. Thanks, Xavi!

The duplex was very nice and spacious, clean, charming, outfitted with everything we needed, with comfortable beds and a very nice kitchen (with an induction cooktop!).  The property is older and there was some remodeling noise for a few hours from the neighboring apartment, which we could hear through what seemed to be a shared skylight, but it was very brief and not a concern (unless noise privacy is a very high priority, which it wasn't for us).  We didn't even use the third bedroom with bunk beds, but it would be ideal for a family.  The metro was close enough, and the bakery just downstairs, together with the grocery store literally across the street, were a wonderful convenience.  We went nearly everywhere by metro, and the location was central enough that at the end of the day, if we were too tired to make our way back by metro, an easy cab ride back to the apartment never exceeded 8 euros (which would've been the cost of the metro for all four of us anyway).

Stock mit einem schönen Glas Wein oder morgens zum Frühstück ist klasse.\r\nWenn wir erneut nach Barcelona fahren, kommen wir gern wieder.\r\nDas Viertel ist sehr angenehm und alle Einkaufsmöglichkeiten schnell zu erreichen. V.a. lokaler Bäcker im Nachbarhaus und Metzger einige Häuser weiter sind zu empfehlen.\r\nAuch die Nachbarn sind sehr freundlich. Einige von ihnen feiern gern bis spät in die Nacht. Bei offenen Fenstern lässt sich dann nur mit Stöpseln schlafen. Aber die Wohnung ist sicher eine der ruhigeren Unterkünfte in Barcelona.\r\nUnserer Meinung nach ist die Wohnung ideal für 3-4 Personen oder eine Familie mit Kindern. Es gibt einen Raum mit einem KingSize Bett, ein Kinderzimmer für 2. Der dritte Raum ist für eine Person gut geeignet, ist zur Treppe in der Wohnung nur mit einem Vorhang getrennt und hat ein Dachfenster.\r\nHerzlichen Dank nochmal an die lieben Gastgeber\r\n"},{"_id":"30995062","date":{"$date":"2015-04-30T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1112838","reviewer_id":"1749568","reviewer_name":"Tatjana","comments":"Nous avons séjourné dans cet appartement en avril 2015.

My husband and I and our two girls, aged 6 and 7, stayed for a month. We couldn't have found a better place. Yamila let us into the apartment and answered any questions we had. The apartment is perfectly situated near a metro stop with easy access to anything you would want to see or do in Barcelona. There are great places to eat nearby and a small supemarket, pastry shop, butcher, fresh fish place, and a general store sort of place all on the same street. There are some great and friendly neighbors as well. There is a nice outdoor eating place off the kitchen. All the basics are covered and we were able to make meals in the apartment without any issues. Took us a minute to figure out the stovetop but after finding the instructions in English online we realized if it was blinking at us there wasn't enough weight and we needed to move the pot or pan to a smaller eye. We had a problem with the washing machine and called Xavi who was accommodating and over within an hour to check it out. He also collected the keys our last day and was as easy and wonderful to work with as Yamila. We even had some family members come visit in the extra bedroom, which did not have an AC unit but was fine with a fan - at least for the month of June when we were there. Having the second bathroom when we had guests was nice too. I would highly recommend this place for anyone. I appreciated that what you see is what you get. The pictures are exactly what you will see and have in the apartment.

Ces points, importants, font en sorte que la location est acceptable. Cependant, les photos donnent une impression plus positive de l'appartement que la réalité; une des deux chambres manquent complètement d'intimité, ce qui pourrait être réglé en faisant transférant cette chambre dans une pièce quasi de rangement qui est inutilisée; l,appartement est vieillot, ce qui pourrait être acceptable, si des efforts étaient consentis pour remplacer tout ce qui est désuet et demande des réparations, somme toute, mineures: rideau de douche à quelques euros, changé de couleur et pas du tout invitant, cafetière à expresso qui a 100 ans...pleins de petits éléments brisés ou pas adéquats: lumière dans l,escalier, bout de plancher brisé, barure de porte brisée. Bref, il y a des limites à vouloir faire de l'argent: quelques centaines d'euros investis rendrait ce logement beaucoup plus acceptable. La dame qui nous a accueillie n'est pas en cause; elle est aimable et l'appartement avait été bien nettoyé, mais reste douteux quand les épouses refusent de prendre une douche parce que le rideau est blanc-brun...Finalement, je crois que AIRBNB n'est pas assez présent dans le rapport avec le locateur: il n'y a pas de standards suffisants pour garantir l'acceptabilité du service.

Although it is a relatively small space it felt spacious for the five of us. \r\n\r\nThe entrance is through quite a dark courtyard and arriving late at night it did give us pause. But during the day you realize it's an inner courtyard accessed by several apartments, full mostly with families from what we could see.\r\n\r\nThe kitchen had everything we needed for simple meals, the bathrooms worked perfectly, the little reading nook was a favorite space, and the air conditioning in the two primary bedrooms was appreciated as it was a hot week when we stayed. The middle room with the couch that turns into a bed didn't have air conditioning and it took some thinking to get air flowing through that space.\r\n\r\nWe liked the neighborhood as it feels like it is full of locals, not tourists. There are restaurants all around as well as markets and shops, making it very simple to keep everyone happy with food. The metro and bus stops are within a few blocks and very convenient. Both my sister and I used the bus to go to the airport (40 mins or so), though a taxi from the airport was only about 25 Euro.\r\n\r\nNoise does travel easily from apartment to apartment in the courtyard but I was impressed by how well everyone stuck to the quiet hours. From around 11 at night until around 10 in the morning there was very little noise. \r\n\r\nI would happily stay at Cristina's again, both for the comfort of the apartment and the authenticity of the neighborhood."},{"_id":"80983843","date":{"$date":"2016-06-20T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1112838","reviewer_id":"18974254","reviewer_name":"Laura","comments":"Una casa con mucho encanto, cómoda, tranquila y en un barrio con todo lo necesario a un paso de casa.

My family and I (a group of 4) stayed here for a full week in June. At the time, Barcelona was having an unusual heat wave, so Cristina's place ended up being a true oasis for us! Poble Sec is a great neighborhood and allows for easy access to many of the main attractions in Barcelona. We would regularly walk a couple short blocks to the main road, Paral Lel, and easily catch a taxi to the beach or to Oldtown for sightseeing etc. It's possible to walk to many sights, but during the heat wave we had to rely on rides!\nThe house itself was lovely, fully equipped kitchen, two bathrooms and a very comfortable living room. The downstairs patio magically stays cooler than anywhere else outside so we sat there often. Everything was clean and easy to use!\nThere is a wonderful bakery next door that we went to every morning. Two great plazas in either direction a block away for coffees, sandwiches, tapas and drinks. And, there is a market directly across the street so you always have access to necessities. Carrer Blai is a lively street very close by that is buzzing at night with great people watching. This is a fantastic place for pinxtos, with every option you can imagine. This is a great street for lounging with drinks in outdoor seating and seems to be filled with locals and tourists alike.\nCristina was fast with communication and gave lots of information about the house and area. Yamilla helped us check in and out, and was so kind and helpful!!

Our host was a total delight - really good at her job!  She met us at the exact appointed times, and I knew that I could count on her if anything went awry.  She was great at providing us with so many useful details about the area and for giving me all the instructions that I needed to cook and do laundry. (I guess I can't get away from that - even on vacation!!!)  \nThe house was super comfortable for me, my husband, and our two teen boys. It was also VERY clean and tidy.  Everyone had their own space - which was a welcome departure from what we experienced in London and Paris.   We did rely on the air conditioning at night. It was pretty hot for us - as we come from Oregon and are not so used to it!  We made good use of the patio, that's for sure!  (Actually, there are three outdoor patios in this home, but the one on the bottom floor, off the kitchen, got the most use by us.)  \nThe baths were great - just fine.  We are a very tall family (all the men are over 6'5\") so it was good to use a shower that they could stand up in!  \nThe kitchen was really great to use and provided everything we needed!  I was so grateful for how thoughtfully everything was provided to us as guests.  \nThe location is ideal - it's just two blocks from the Metro and the neighborhood has all the shops you need for local shopping - a bakery, a butcher, a Super Mercado and tons of cafes.  It's not a touristy location at all - which we loved.   My boys went down to the beach almost every day we were there - to swim, drink beer (and look at the awesome women !!) and my husband and I explored the beautiful streets and art and culture of Barcelona - all within easy reach.  \nWe hope to come back!  We would love to book again and certainly recommend this very nice Pablo-sec apt to friends and family... and anyone reading this review!\nDenise Slattery and Steve Michener\nLake Oswego, Oregon\n"},{"_id":"173819433","date":{"$date":"2017-07-24T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1112838","reviewer_id":"61781479","reviewer_name":"Annalisa","comments":"Wonderful apartment in a great location.

It isn't ok. Do one or the other, not both. Show some consideration, especially as you completely ignored my booking rule in my profile by accepting my booking. \n5) High buildings are common in HK but be aware this is on the 28th floor. Avoid if you don't like heights. There's no mention of the floor level in the advert.\n6) Worst of all, there appears to be someone with either mental health problems or operating some type of industrial activity in the room directly above, as there were regular loud banging and scraping noises until after midnight.

The neighbourhood is such that you have lots of cheap delicious food all around you and beautiful views of the bridge. The F train is close and the neighbourhood that surrounds the apartment is still an authentic part of New York City, including with all its grit and grime. The tall ceilings of the apartment make it feel very airy and spacious and it stays cool even when its warm out because it is in the back of the building.

The airconditioning was working, which was great, because it was very hot in New York at the time I stayed there. The appartment is situated in/near Chinatown so it is not in the centre of Manhattan, but there are multiple subway stations nearby and it did not take me long to get anywhere in New York.

As we got there we had to pick up the key from the laundromat across the street, it wasn’t the host who gave us the key. One thing that I totally disliked was that it didn’t not say on the description that this studio is located on the fourth floor and there is no elevator. So if you plan on staying here for vacation I do not recommend it, the last thing you wanna do after a long day in NYC is go up four flights of stairs. Also going up and down with luggage is a pain because the stairs are narrow. Other than that, the place was clean and just how it was on the pictures."}]}

The living room was decent sized with a couch, chair, coffee table and table/chairs, microwave, sink, fridge, linens, not much else. The hallway to the apartment unfortunately smells very bad of cigarette smoke. The apartment also smells of it but there were many air fresheners and ac to help with the smell. The apartment had the bare essentials. But it was just what you need if you want to spend money on other things to explore NY (amazing location) and to sleep. Our host, Samantha was great!

Easy to hail a taxi from the front door. Pushcart Coffee, two and half blocks away at the corner of 2nd and @21st, is the perfect way to start the day. (I get no perks for saying that. It's just honest, good coffee with a proper neighborhood feel.) The convenience store/bodega across the street cooks great \"egg on a roll\" breakfasts, not microwaved.\r\n\r\nThe building and apartment are a little funky but we would definitely stay there again and we would recommend the place to anyone.

I knew one day I would return to Hawaii, the place I fell in love with long ago. I took a leap of faith and purchased my Maui condo June 2002 this was the beginning of fulfilling her prophecy to once again return to Hawaii soil.\r\n\r\nI am a tropical expression artist who paints on canvas and etched metal.  My work is inspired by the beauty of the islands and has been displayed in several Maui art galleries over the years.  I am a writer and have my first book on Amazon.

Located in Midtown East near the UN, in an unbelievably quiet neighborhood. Train stops were accessible within a few short blocks of walking distance. Its close proximity to 5th Avenue, Central Park, \u0026 Times Square allowed us to have access to all the touristy NYC sites without any of the noise. I'd highly recommend the flat to anyone.\r\n\r\nOn a side note Joris was in no small way, responsible for salvaging a surprise birthday trip for my girlfriend, which I sincerely appreciate.

I lived in New York before and I travel to New York quite often, therefore, I am quite familiar with city. 1. Joris is a very nice person. He is always willing to assist you and to accommodate to your requests. He answers almost immediately all your messages. I am quite grateful with him as we could agree on an early check-in and a late check-out. In fact, my parents are in their 80s and I needed to make the trip a comfortable experience for them. 2. Ups (i) The apartment is extremely well located (51st and Second Avenue). It is in midtown and you can enjoy the city just walking. The subway is three blocks away from the apartment. (ii) Even though in midtown, the neighbourhood is tranquil, neat, charming and not noisy. (iii) For New York standards, the apartment is big. Please consider -if you have never been in New York- that places size tend to be quite small in Manhattan. Space is a luxury in the city. (iv) The apartment is on a first floor which is quite helpful as New York's buildings sometimes do not have elevator (you should always ask if there is one if you are renting an apartment). (v) The apartment has one living - dining room, a small kitchen, two bedrooms and two bathrooms. I will not recommend it for more than 4 people. One bedroom is located on the first floor and the second one is located in the basement. (vi) The apartment is cozy. It looks like in the pictures. (vii) The patio is lovely. It is very unusual to find an apartment with its own access to a patio in New York. (vii) The beds are quite comfortable. I travel a lot and stay in several 4-5 stars hotels. The beds were as comfortable as the ones I find in my trips. 3. Matters to be considered: (i) Being the apartment in an old building you can hear the noise of your neighbours, particularly at night, which may cause troubles for having a restful sleep. My parents, who stayed on the first floor, were awaken some nights for the noise coming from the second floor (around midnight, apparently they move furnitures). (ii) The room located in the basement is particularly noisy at nights. It is next to a corridor where the washing machines are located and which also provides access to the patio. As I slept in that room, I needed to wear ear-plugs for not to be awaken at nights. However, one night not even the ear-plugs helped. I heart people walking and talking in the corridor very late that night. I walked up scared as I thought there was actually somebody in my room! (iii) The door in the basement needs curtains. In fact, there is one door which provides access to the patio with a window which allows people in the patio to see..."},{"_id":"108546350","date":{"$date":"2016-10-16T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11223389","reviewer_id":"9239670","reviewer_name":"Claudia","comments":"El apartemento era estupendo, super bien ubicado, limpio y cómodo.

O problema começou no check in. Segundo o procedimento padrão do proprietário, me foi fornecido um código de acesso ao prédio e a porta do apartamento estaria destrancada. Ao chegar no local na hora de check in combinada (16:00hs) me deparei com uma pessoa que estava ainda limpando o apartamento. Essa pessoa não sabia fornecer qualquer informação de uso das instalações e foi embora sem deixar a chave do apartamento. Esse foi o primeiro transtorno, pois tive que ficar dentro do apartamento até o dia seguinte às 11:00 am, tendo que cancelar dois compromissos já agendados previamente. No mesmo dia de nossa chegada ao tentar abrir a porta de um armário, a mesma se desprendeu e caiu sobre minha cabeça. No dia seguinte pela manhã, reparamos que haviam cacos de vidro no carpete e minha filha criança quase se cortou. Os incidentes foram imediatamente comunicados ao Joris, mas nada aconteceu, eu mesma tive que limpar o carpete e a porta do armário ficou insegura e nos colocando em risco durante toda a estadia.\nO horário de meu voo foi modificado pela companhia aérea para tarde da noite e eu solicitei um check out tardio, para evitar que ficássemos com crianças o dia todo na rua. O meu pedido foi negado, sendo alegado que haveriam hospedes chegando. Foi me dada opção de deixar as malas no corredor do prédio. Considerei um insulto essa opção, pois colocaria em risco a segurança de nossa bagagem. Mesmo tendo perdido quase 24 horas de minha estadia por ter que esperar a chave em nossa chegada, o anfitrião não considerou em nada os transtornos que tivemos. Não conheci pessoalmente o Joris, embora ele tenha respondido a todos meus emails, alguns tardiamente, com educação. O apartamento é bom, os colchões não são confortáveis, a cozinha não é muito bem equipada para pessoas que realmente cozinham. Eramos quatro pessoas e haviam somente 4 copos e 4 cobertores (sentimos frio e não haviam instruções sobre como ajustar o aquecedor central); as panelas velhas e encardidas, o forno de microondas e fogão com restos de alimentos. à noite e pela manhã cedo escutávamos passos e barulhos dos vizinhos de cima e o aquecedor central fazia um barulho a noite toda. A localização do apartamento é excelente. Não tenho certeza se voltaria a me hospedar nesse apartamento outra vez."},{"_id":"230573964","date":{"$date":"2018-01-28T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11223389","reviewer_id":"43029735","reviewer_name":"Mark","comments":"This is an excellent, comfortable, reasonably-priced place in a great neighborhood, hosted by a responsive, clear, considerate, and pleasant host.

Our stay was in December, cold outside. The downstairs room did not heat up well at all. Very cold at night, especially for the person sleeping on the daybed. Even with the addition of the red blanket from the closet and the gray blanket from the upstairs bed, that bed was cold both nights.

It is super easy to grab food or supplies as it is just a very quick walk to the ABC store and to Food Pantry. It's also right next to a transport hub (at the front of the Ilikai Hotel) so you can catch The Bus or Shuttles to all over town. It's only a few minutes walk to shopping at the Ala Moana centre, and you can walk to Waikiki yet you are away from the frenetic pace of hotels and tourists along the beach strip. Kelly is very efficient, prompt and honest in her communications and her recommendations on where to eat and what to do were great.

I was worried that it would be too small for our family of 3, but this studio fit us all comfortably. Kelly was always quick to respond (within minutes) of any questions that I had. She has almost everything you can think of at this place for your convenience - paper goods, a hair dryer, cooler for the beach, coffee maker, etc. Parking was $20/day if you paid in advance. We paid for a full week, so it was easy to get in and out of the marina. The location was close to Ala Moana Center and we could walk to the shopping center or beach easily. There was a laundry area downstairs from the apartment, which we used to wash our sandy towels (pay per use). My siblings and I were super happy with our stay here and we cannot wait to come back to Pineapple Paradise! It truly was a home away from home.

There is an ABC convenience store right across the street and has almost anything you could think of you’d need for this trip.

The condo itself is in an older building on the quieter side of Waikiki, but still completely walkable to all the action - 5 mins to the Ala Moana Shopping Centre, a 3 minute walk to the Hilton Lagoon which is right on the beach and about a 10 minute walk to the heart of Waikiki (we will call that walk to Island Vintage Coffee, which is a must by the way!). Because the condo is on a quieter street, it was an easy pick up point for an Uber, which we took to other attractions rather than paying for tours ($13 USD to Diamond Head, for example). Kelly’s condo was nicely decorated and the perfect size for 2 people. The decor made us feel right at home and the bed was super comfortable as far as Murphy beds go! The view of the city from the condo was amazing and the window with sliding doors is much bigger and brighter than it appears in the photos - it was a nice touch to be able to see the sun rise over the mountain and buildings right from your bed! We would recommend Pineapple Paradise to our friends and family and would definitely stay here again."},{"_id":"249193669","date":{"$date":"2018-04-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1129061","reviewer_id":"131837096","reviewer_name":"Jo","comments":"Great place, Great location!"},{"_id":"261706661","date":{"$date":"2018-05-06T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1129061","reviewer_id":"118355571","reviewer_name":"Petar","comments":"Kelly really is a superhost! My wife and I loved our week-long stay at this apartment.\n\nFirst of all, the location is excellent. We found ourselves within walking distance of the beach, the Ala Moana shopping mall, a beach park with booths for parasailing and snorkeling tour companies, and several grocery stores. I think that being able to walk to a proper grocery store (rather than just an ABC store) was unique for an apartment in Waikiki, and ended up saving us a good amount of money. Of course, all of Waikiki's best stores and restaurants are also a 15 minute walk, or 2 minute bus ride, away. Any tour you book involving a bus ride (we did 3: a luau, kayaking trip, and a pearl harbor tour) will stop next door in front of the Ilikai hotel, which is also very convenient.\n\nWhat also made this stay great were the thoughtful extra features provided in the apartment, including two indispensable beach chairs and a mini cooler, a keyless door lock, and a very well-equipped kitchen. \n\nFinally, we really appreciated how easy it was to reach Kelly, and how prompt she was in responding. At one point our internet/phone/tv service in the apartment was interrupted and, even though she was overseas, Kelly was able to get it working again within 20 minutes.\n\nWe look forward to staying at this apartment again on our future visits!"},{"_id":"265344777","date":{"$date":"2018-05-16T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1129061","reviewer_id":"84993632","reviewer_name":"Victoria","comments":"This was my first time in Hawaii and I absolutely loved staying at Kelly’s place!

The location is decent and within walking distance of a lot of places. The pricing is fair and check in was very easy. The hostess has no control over this, but the first day, my ride dropped me off and made the mistake of pulling into the parking structure. We were in the parking structure for less than 5 minutes and were asked to pay the $4. I think if you're just doing a quick drop off, try to do it on the street and save some money! There was one minor issue with the place that has been communicated privately with the hostess. Based on her quick responses in the past, I think she will probably resolve it without any issues.
