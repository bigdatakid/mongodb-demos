This room was actually my second room staying with Kath right after the first which was also a wonderful experience. Kath was consistently a wonderful lady who made my partner and I feel very welcome right from the start, all the way to the end. Even prior to meeting her in person, what  I was impressed with how highly responsive Kath was with communication. She was very welcoming and friendly with an approachable nature. The room was very accurate to description; quite large and spacious with lots of natural light, especially with a wonderful and large balcony attached. I was very impressed with the interior design of the room by Kath herself which brought out the unique aspects, and brought character to the room. It was bright and beautiful with wonderful combinations of patterns and colours. It was very impressive. Everything was accessible and ready when we arrived, including many fresh towels, shampoo, conditioner, body wash etc.,as well as chargers on either sides of the bed. The bed itself was very large and comfortable. Additionally, Kath even went out shopping and brought home cereal etc. which made us feel welcome. In addition, the accommodation at Redfern itself was quite convenient. It was approximately 200m away from the train station which was very close by Central (even within walking distance ~15mins). Late night shops, especially bars and restaurants were also close-by and near walking distance. Definitely will be recommending to family and friends to stay :). Thanks Kath.

My mum and I were there for a few days to explore Sydney. Great location just minutes away from the train station and it took no time at all to get to the CBD. It was a really nice room with a nice balcony and everything was clean. It was great that we also had our own private mini fridge. Kath provided towels and soaps for the shower as well. Kath also provided suggestions for things to do in Sydney and she recommended a restaurant called Blue Fish in Darling Harbour which was the most delicious seafood dinner I have ever had. The service at the restaurant was also amazing, we mentioned Kath's name and they gave us a free calamari dish! The view from the restaurant was also beautiful. If you want a nice seafood dish I would definitely recommend it! Overall the experience was lovely and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again if I'm ever back in Sydney. Thanks Kath!

When we first arrived in Sydney (8am) we were not allowed to drop our luggage off until after 5pm. We had to pay some ridiculous amount to leave it at a train staion in storage for the day.\n\nThe bed was extremely hard and uncomfortable. The toilet paper had run out at one point and wasn't even replaced for abit. The appartment was otherwise clean and very close to Redfern train station making it very convenient getting everywhere you need to go in-and-around Sydney.\n\nWe orgainised with Kath a couple of days prior to leave our luggage at the appartment on the last day as our flight wasn't until 9.30pm. We agreed we would be past to pick our luggage up at 7-7.30pm. When we messaged Kath that we were outside the appartment complex, she sent a reply message saying \"she wasn't in Sydney\" and that it would take around 45 minutes to organise for her to find someone to come and let us in to the apartment. Luckily for us the couple renting the other Airbnb room came home and let us in as otherwise we definitely would have missed our flight home. \n\nWe have done many Airbnbs and they have all been fantastic.

However if thats not an issue for you then I highly recommend! :)"},{"_id":"349632700","date":{"$date":"2018-11-18T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9156574","reviewer_id":"101032146","reviewer_name":"Nguyen","comments":"Kath’s place was cozy, close to the station.

Primeiramente, o Marcelo foi super gentil em antecipar nosso check in por conta de problemas\npessoais. Respondeu rápido e se dispôs imediatamente a me ajudar. O apartamento é enorme. Uma das maiores e mais belas salas que já conheci. Os quartos são super espaçosos. Os ar condicionados (apesar de serem de janela) funcionam muito bem. Os banheiros também estão ótimos e o da suíte é bem grande. A cozinha e lavanderia não são muito grandes (mas quem quer ficar na cozinha quando pode comer fora no Rio). Mas tanto a cozinha quanto à lavanderia tem tudo o que precisamos. A cozinha é americana o que facilita curtir com quem está na sala se vc está cozinhando. A internet e tv a cabo funcionam perfeitamente. Os porteiros são super gentis e prestativos. E como a região é muito segura, não vi nenhum problema quanto a não ter os porteiros durante a noite. O melhor deste apartamento é a localização. A melhor localização do Rio de Janeiro. O melhor lugar de Ipanema. Perto da Livraria Travessa, perto de dois supermercados zona sul, perto de varias farmácias 24h, perto de bares e restaurantes maravilhosos e super bem badalados, perto de bancos, perto do metrô Nossa Senhora da Paz, perto da praia e perto do shopping Leblon. Quando eu falo perto, é muito perto...da pra ir andando mesmo. E perto da Lagoa. Tivemos a oportunidade de ver a inauguração da árvore da Lagoa bem perto do apartamento. Amei a experiência.

The location of this property is absolutely perfect in my opinion. This property is one block from the beach, which is awesome. The rooftop deck you see in the pictures is pretty incredible. Since the property is on the very south side of Waikiki, it gives you an unobstructed, 180 degree view of diamond head and the ocean - it's pretty spectacular! I love snorkeling and there's actually pretty decent snorkeling spot on Queen's beach close to the wall between Queen's Beach and Queen's Surf Beach which is a 4\nminute walk from the room. If you keep exploring for about 45 minutes you'll probably see a couple hundred fish and 8-10 different species of fish. I've always rented snorkel gear from Snorkel Bob's who is 5min from this property and they're great. Lastly about the area, we walked down and had breakfast at the Barefoot Beach Cafe one morning and I would recommend it. Great food and awesome ambiance next to the ocean.\n\nThe room was great also. It seemed slightly smaller in person than in the pictures, but it perfect for what we needed and great for a couple. Everything looked upgraded and really nice in the unit. Similar or better pricing than a decent hotel, but it's more spacious and you get a full kitchen (fridge, stove, microwave, toaster, pots and pans to cook on and nice dishes to use. There were also beach chairs and an umbrella to use in the closet. We enjoyed staying in and just watching TV some nights. The TV swivels so you can watch in bed and there's a pretty good lineup of channels here (200+) with a DVR which was great. The only downside to the building is the pool doesn't look that good. When you're 150 yards from an incredible beach - and specifically Kuhio Beach that's walled off so it feels like a pool anyway, there's really not even a need for the pool on the property. \n\nOverall we had a great experience. Because of the location, 180 degree rooftop view of diamond head and the ocean, quality of the room, and the price, we will probably always try to stay here first when we visit Waikiki in the future!

The roof deck of the building has a great view.\n\nBut I wouldn’t have booked this room if I knew there is a unbearable noisy air conditioner and very thin curtains with poor quality which was hard to keep the light out, they made me couldn’t sleep well every night. When you turned on the air conditioner, even in eco mode, it starts off fairly quiet. However it then alternates between this level and a significant rattle. We spoke to Mark about this, he came down to hear it for himself but insisted that the noise level was \"within range\". Needless to say, we disagree. I have sympathy for him because this is a brand new aircon unit, but I'm afraid for a small studio apartment it is still too noisy. The unit is about 50cm from your head when sleeping, and it simply prevents you from being able to sleep well.\n \nHope it can be solved one day."}]}

The layout of the flat is ideal, as although the guest room is in the middle of the flat, it does not feel as though you're stepping on each other. Finally, there is a LIFT which is so unusual, but a blessing for tired feet after a long day. Lucia and Edu are relaxed and cheerful hosts, and it was a pleasure to be in their flat for a week, the room is spacious and had everything I needed.

I spent a Friday night at Kevin's to go to an event at Barclays (a pleasant 10-15 minute walk away) and catch up with some friends, then tool around NY on my own the next day. Kevin was as accessible and accomodating as could be concerning my arrival and departure times, which was a big help because I tend to come to NY with a plan that consists solely of places to eat (of which there are many in walking distance) and fill in the blanks as I go.\r\n\r\nI felt completely safe walking back alone at 3 am after enjoying some nightlife, and didn't worry about tiptoeing around when I got back in, as Kevin made it clear that I couldn't possibly disturb his slumber. The two rooms you're renting here are sunny and well-maintained, with good wifi, a comfortable bed, a clean shared bathroom and use of the fridge and kitchen. What else could you need?\r\n\r\nOverall, I had a great time, loved the neighborhood, and appreciate everything Kevin does to make sure his guests have a pleasant, fairly priced, and stress-free stay. The next time I need a place to stay in BK, he'll be at the top of my list.

The neighborhood was really great and safe, close to subways and full of really nice restaurants and coffee shops. There were tons of great shopping stores and groceries. Moreover, the access to the Subway and the park is an important plus. We were out late every night and Kevin assured us that he is cool with that. He was easygoing and really friendly. He would even invite us to eat out together, even though we were very busy and couldn’t hang out as much. But for sure next time we will do it, because he is nice and we enjoyed talking to him.\nWatching his “bonsai” in our room was pleasant and made it feel like home. The living room has only two lamp shades, which sometimes was really relaxing, but perhaps maybe too dark if you needed to work or read. We could cook in the kitchen and it was no problem. Sometimes communicating could be a little hard for us because English is not our first language.  But still, even though he was busy, he would answer our questions patiently.\nStaying at this place was overall a good experience, and I think next time we will go there again."},{"_id":"9268723","date":{"$date":"2013-12-17T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"919491","reviewer_id":"9483909","reviewer_name":"Cori","comments":"Kevin was welcoming and very kind.

J'avais besoin de me sentir accueillie, rassurée dans une ville que je ne connaissais pas ou peu. Les commentaires sur Kévin étaient tellement favorables et chaleureux, que je me sentais vraiment rassurée, même si les échanges par mail avec lui n'ont pas été très nombreux ni étoffés. Une semaine avant mon départ, je lui demandais des conseils par mail sur mon arrivée à son domicile. Pas de nouvelle. La veille, je lui téléphonais.... Et là...Oh, surprise !!! Il m'annonçait qu'il ne serait pas là à mon arrivée, mais également qu'il serait absent toute la semaine (déplacement professionnel). Grande déception pour moi... Mais Kévin s'est vu rassurant et vraiment sympathique en m'assurant que tout se passerait bien et que l'appart était situé dans un très chouette quartier. Nous avons convenus d'un endroit pour la remise de clefs. Et le début de l'aventure commençait... Et en effet, comme Kévin l'avait présagé tout s'est bien passé !!!  L'appart est confortable et très bien situé. Mes enfants et moi avons adoré le quartier. Brooklyn est génial...Les gens sont hyper sympas, très décontractés...Pour la fin de notre séjour, je demandais des précisions pour le dépôt des clefs : 1 mail, 2 sms. Pas de réponse. J'ai laissé les clefs à l'intérieur et nous sommes parties. Et là, le lendemain, alors que j'étais rentrée en France, Kévin me demandait si j'avais laissé les clefs au même endroit où je les avais trouvées. Et non, je ne pouvais deviner que d'autres hôtes arriveraient !\r\nCe que j'attendais de cette expérience, c'était vraiment un accueil. Je pense que j'aurais annulé la réservation si j'avais su qu'il serait absent. Mon choix de voyage était d'être chez l'habitant. \r\nAlors, oui, tout s'est bien passé... et je reste sur cette note positive.

Don't forget to check out the Botanical Gardens at Prospect Park which is within walking distance from the apartment. \r\n\r\nPark Slope is really close to several subway stations which made getting around very easy. I was also surprised at how reasonable cabs were - we took a cab to and from LaGuardia to the apartment and it only cost about $35.  \r\n\r\nThe apartment itself was great.

Kevin responded quickly both before and during our trip.  He was there to greet us when we arrived and the room was clean and ready for us to stay.  The room is spacious, clean and comfortable, and Kevin is a great host.  We enjoyed talking with him about the neighborhood - which is great!  This is one of the best NYC neighborhoods and you get to stay there for a steal.  Convenient to the subway (~25min ride from Port Authority) and walkable to everything you'll need (groceries, coffee, restaurants, pharmacy, etc.)  We went to a tournament at Barclays Center and it was an easy walk each day, and still centrally located enough that we could stop back home before heading into other boroughs for the evening.

Erikoista oli se, ettei asunnon ovea saanut lukkoon, ainoastaan rapun oven. Naapurusto on kuitenkin hyvin rauhallinen ja ihmiset tuntevat toisensa, joten ilmeisesti mitään ei yleensä häviä...

We explored the area  thoroughly and found a wonderful coffee shop just a couple of blocks away, an ice cream shop and juice bar just around another corner and tons of restaurants nearby. Kevin had plenty of advice for places to eat and see but since my daughter lives in another area of Brooklyn with several roommates, this was a perfect way to visit her without being crammed in with the craziness of that. The subway and bus system is quite close by and the neighborhood is beautiful to walk around and explore and it's very quiet at night unlike our last stay in the city.

Kevin's a terrific host: friendly, accommodating, easy-going, and equally happy to chat or leave you alone depending on what you'd like. The apartment is as classic Brooklyn as you could possibly ask for, in a gorgeous Brownstone. That means it's an older building, so don't expect brand-new amenities. You'll get some noise from the street (although the French doors into the bedroom do a lot to mitigate that). But you get a ton of space, and the fun of staying in an old-school New York beauty. \r\n\r\nAnd let's face it, when you come to NYC, you're going to be going out and enjoying the town, not hanging around the apartment all day long. You're paying for the location, and the location here is absolutely INCREDIBLE.

It may say you have a private room, however it feels as if you have the full apartment to yourself. The room is very large and such a great deal! The location truly gives you the true New York neighborhood feel without all the tourists. It has a bar district, cute market across the street, and many little boutiques. It is a quick walk to the subway which will take you into Manhattan in no time at all. I will definitely try to stay here next time in the city!

The place is very clean, and Kevin made sure we had everything needed. The location is convenient too, which only takes 20-25 min to reach lower manhattan on a N/Q/B train. (Don't take R since it's local and much slower.) My husband and I were traveling with my parents, so the bedroom + living room settings were perfect. You can shut the door to the bedroom and they turn into two bedrooms. I was a little worried about the air mattress in the living room, but it's actually much more comfortable than expected since it's a raised airbed. You might want to put a blanket on top of the airbed before lying down in winter if you prefer sleeping warm. Otherwise it's great. Kevin and his apartment definitely set a high bar for my AirBnb experience.

There are markets a block of walk away but we were stunned by the selection available at Fairway Market which is about 5 km away where we saw so many products we've never seen in where we live.

She even went to the trouble of buying us a DVD player whilst we were there as the apartment didn't have one. The neighbourhood is what could be described as up and coming. It has pockets of gentrification but still is very much a regular, vibrant area which we enjoyed. As we have young children we weren't often out late at night but I'd say there are probably safer areas (but definitely many that would be more dangerous!)

Our experiences at Peaches (both of them) and Saraghina were great. The main floor kitchen, dining and living areas are well situated and well stocked with condiments and the little things to assist with home cooked meals.  The main bath was nicely appointed and the laundry worked well.  We had some issues with the alarm system that was resolved by Brian. He was kind enough to bring over some fruit and original NY bagels and cream cheese for us to try when he came to assist. The neighborhood seems safe, with friendly folks on the street at all hours, coming and going but as another reviewer said can be a bit noisy at times.  The A-C Subway lines provided reliable  transportation and were about a 10 minute walk to Utica Av station. We used the 7 day unlimited Metro card to go all over not just Manhattan. No car is required to get around.  Adina and her group were very accommodating and had also arranged our airport pickup for us. Overall, don't expect the Fairmont Plaza experience but this is a nice place to stay in Brooklyn."},{"_id":"9157333","date":{"$date":"2013-12-09T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"921585","reviewer_id":"7265900","reviewer_name":"Kate","comments":"Great place!

Ampio, molto suggestivo per gli interni che lasciano trasparire la sua storia. Molto luminoso grazie alle tante finestre presenti. Bellissimo camminare sul parquet che scricchiola ad ogni passo.\r\nNoi abbiamo alloggiato a Giugno, il tempo è stato abbastanza instabile ma non abbiamo patito il caldo, è facile creare corrente in casa.\r\nLa fermata della metropolitana (Kingston Throop Avs) è a meno di 10 minuti da casa. Vi ferma la linea C local.\r\nDall'aeroporto JFK l'appartamento può essere raggiunto in taxi oppure con il bus che ferma a pochi metri da casa (noi l'abbiamo usato quando siamo ripartiti, ci impiega circa 45/50 minuti e si può usare la metrocard).\r\nNon abbiamo incontrato direttamente Adina, ma all'arrivo è venuto ad accoglierci Lester, molto gentile e disponibile per informazioni e suggerimenti.\r\nIl quartiere è sicuro, ci siamo sempre mossi in tranquillità anche la sera. Consiglio colazione da Brunswick cafè, cena da Peaches, Saraghina o Beso. Da Beso ottimo anche il brunch.\r\nLa nostra esperienza è stata molto positiva. Pernottare a Manhattan, quando si visita New York, è molto comodo perché si riducono i tempi trascorsi in metro ed è più facile passare da casa, ma Brooklyn è un'ottima soluzione per spendere un po' meno e avere spazi decisamente più ampi.\r\nIn casa c'è wi-fi. Peccato che nelle camere sopra il segnale sia molto debole, ma basta avvicinarsi alle scale per connettersi facilmente.\r\nL'unica vera difficoltà l'abbiamo avuta con il lucchetto con le chiavi, per noi è stato impossibile aprirlo.\r\nOvviamente consiglierò l'appartamento a chi mi chiederà suggerimenti per pernottare a New York."},{"_id":"15025199","date":{"$date":"2014-07-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"921585","reviewer_id":"11547441","reviewer_name":"Fransje \u0026 Mirjam","comments":"We stayed at Macon Street for two weeks in June and we loved it. We chose this house specifically because it had enough room for 4 people. We were not disappointed! There was more than enough space and privacy for two couples. Besides that it's a lovely house with lots of character. We really felt at home here and it was wonderful to relax on the soft sofa after a long day in the city. \r\n\r\nWe really loved the neighborhood, there were all kinds of great places to eat and hang out. You'll find them all on Adina's Map of Brooklyn that's in the apartment. We liked Saraghina the best, but we also loved Peaches! One addition to the list is Brunswick, around the corner and great for breakfast and lunch. \r\n\r\nTransportation to Manhattan was very easy: with the A Train it's a 15 minute ride to downtown. But we also really loved Brooklyn and Bed Stuy in particular! For at least 5 days we didn't even go to Manhattan. \r\n\r\nIf we would have to name one down side to this place it would be that the bar around the corner sometimes plays loud music (only in the weekend at night, but until late). Other than that, we were very happy and Adina and her team responded quickly to our minor issues (putting the A/C units in when we asked). \r\n\r\nWe hope to visit again some day!

Convenient, comfortable, really nice. It seems everything is still up to the early twenties .. the wooden staircase, parquet, the two very large bedrooms, double living room and kitchen. \r\nall really nice. \r\nIf I can find some small minus (otherwise what review would be ??), I'd give a general refresher with particular attention to the handles of the rooms and the doors frame\r\n\r\nWifi. I think that is the biggest issue now for all the guest of Airbnb. Internet at home has its hub in the basement and then in the rooms of the second floor is not so good.  \r\n\r\nHost: we had a small problem with the shower and Stelian took immediately care of it.. and sent us a caretaker (great guy) to fix it. \r\ninstead, The mysterious Adina managed all the stuff (check in check out ect.. by email and phone, and has proved to be very efficient. \r\nThanks again for everything. \r\n\r\nwe had a really great time in Bed-Stuy"},{"_id":"17499213","date":{"$date":"2014-08-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"921585","reviewer_id":"14517172","reviewer_name":"Elizabeth","comments":"We stayed here with other family members for our daughter's wedding.  What a perfect place for our family!  Spacious, airy, tastefully decorated and comfortable.  We felt at home sitting around the dining room table with our coffee in the morning.  Of course, a walk to Andres-George's coffee shop was another option.  Fantastic chocolate almond pastries!\r\nWe contacted Adina a week before arrival to make sure everything was in order.  She answered her phone promptly which assured us we would be able to contact her in NY if needed.\r\nCheck in was simple.  The lock box was very easy.  Parking required a pass around the block looking for a space, but not a problem.  Note that garbage pickup requires moving your car to one side of the street on some weekday mornings.  Apparently locals simply double park, but something you might want to check on.\r\nThe house is beautifully maintained.  Simple furnishings, bright, airy and clean.  We couldn't have been more pleased.  New kitchen and bath renovations were an added bonus.  A lovely backyard we did not make use of...perhaps next time.\r\nGreat restaurants.  Saraghina's and Peaches we highly recommend.  A corner grocery for any small necessities.\r\nWe were aware of the the possible loud music around the corner on the weekends from a previous review.  It was loud, but the new windows and doors were pretty good at deadening the noise.  \r\nWe thoroughly enjoyed walking around the neighborhood and taking advantage of the fabulous food and architecture.

The house is just as beautiful as it looks in the pictures, and has everything you need for a very comfortable stay. Lots of space, enough for our group of five adults. Two bathrooms, which is an absolute plus, if you are staying with more than two people. The house is situated in a safe and quiet neighbourhood, walking distance to the closest A-train station: 10 minutes, which makes it easy to go to Manhattan as well as to JFK-airport. Lots of parking space in front of the house, if you arrive by car.\nBars and restaurants are right around the corner, make sure to check out „Zaka“ for great breakfast, lunch or dinner, just across the street on Garvey boulevard, which opened the week before we arrived. Great food, lovely staff, brilliant chef.\nCommunication was excellent, we had one or two questions, that were answered immediately. Check in was smooth and easy, check out very generous, as we were allowed to keep our luggage in the house, until we had to go to the airport.\nIt was a perfect stay, highly recommendable, would definitely return, if we came to NYC again.\n"},{"_id":"308526438","date":{"$date":"2018-08-16T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"921585","reviewer_id":"1493313","reviewer_name":"Danielle","comments":"A very beautiful and clean home. The pictures are accurate. We didn’t have much communication with the hosts during our stay (wasn’t required). However,  they are extremely particular about their home so if you have young children or are looking for a homey experience this may not be the place for you. It’s more like staying in a museum- security guards included. They sent us a bill after checkout for over 2,000 dollars and said they would send another related to steaming their sofa and other activities related to what we consider routine cleaning after guest departures. The tenant downstairs is also pretty uptight. That said, it’s a spacious and clean house but not suitable for young families or anyone not up for walking around on eggshells.

The neighborhood is very beautiful and I felt very safe. I walked at night from the subway alone and it was OK. Also, it is 10 minutes away from the subway, but it's like 45 min from Manhattan (trains can take their time to get to the station and you have to consider rush hours, delays, etc), so it may be exhausting sometimes, specially if you walk a lot during the day and then want to get out at night!

Spazi ampi, doppi servizi, lenzuola e asciugamani per ogni ospite. Le camere sono ampie e confortevoli. La linea locale della metropolitana (la C) è da pochi minuti di strada a piedi dall'appartamento. Il treno diretto invece (linea A -  UTICA) è a circa 15 min a piedi, un po' più lontano rispetto alla linea locale, ma comunque raggiungibile con una breve passeggiata. Il tragitto da casa a Manhattan è un po' lunghetto, e varia dalla mezz'ora ai 45 min, a seconda di dove si deve andare, senza contare il tempo per raggiungere la fermata. \nLe distanze da percorrere sono davvero ampie! \nla cucina è completa di tutto, micro onde, forno, fornelli, stoviglie e lavastoviglie. Solo la dotazione di pentole è davvero scarsa. \nSi effettua la raccolta differenziata. Nei dintorni della casa ci sono supermercati e alcuni ristoranti. L'host mette a disposizione degli ospiti, un fascicolo con tutte le informazioni necessarie, davvero completo!\nSe cercate un posto tranquillo dove rifugiarvi la sera dopo esservi tuffati nella folla della grande mela, la casa di Stelian \u0026 Deanna è l'ideale. ottima anche per famiglie con bambini (anche piccoli: la scala che porta alle camere da letto è dotata di cancelletto di sicurezza per i bimbi)"},{"_id":"366865746","date":{"$date":"2019-01-03T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"921585","reviewer_id":"228153524","reviewer_name":"Xinyue","comments":"Very nice great location and spacious room for us"}]}

The room was small (about 2x3 meters), enough space for the bed and your luggage. While the bed is very soft (some might find it too soft) the only problem is the radiator, which cannot be controlled and is a little bit noisy (hissing and clanging). Since it was cold outside, I didn't mind the heat, though it was really warm.\nThe bathroom and kitchen are very tiny, just enough space to stand. It's good enough if you stay out all day and just need a place to sleep. The area is perfect, you have different food places nearby and it's close to Times Square. Just don't expect much for that price.\nI had fresh towels and beddings, the room was clean. Kitchen had washed up dishes, bathroom was ok. Fame herself is clean, depends a little bit on the other guest staying there.\nI only saw Fame when I checked in and when I left. But via airbnb messages she was always available (not that I needed it).\nIf you don't have US mobile connections like I did, the check-in can be tricky. Fame wasn't in the aparment when I got there, but at her mothers place one floor above. The doorbell is supposed to ring there, too, however it didn't. Fortunatly the neighboor knew that her mother lives upstairs so I wen't there and knocked to finally get inside. \nAll in all, good place to stay for a short visit to NYC especially if you plan on visiting the city most of the time.

There any places to get something eat within a few meters of stepping outside of the building. I preferred the 7 Brothers Deli.\n\nThe bathroom was pretty good, having many essentials, like floss and mouthwash. There was a minor lighting issue, but it got fixed during the course of my stay.\n \nThe hosts were generally responsive. I always got a response on the same day of the question.\n\nIt is a good place to crash after exploring New York. The only thing to be wary of is the WiFi speed. It was generally great for giving family and friends Status updates, but it was terrible for streaming video. I suspect that it was due to wireless interference from other apartments, but I can't say for certain.

I left early because I was drugged at a bar down the street and felt very uncomfortable staying there afterward, understandably. I don't recommend this place to a female travelling alone. Not because of the hosts (they're very sweet!) but because I did NOT feel safe alone in the area. It takes a lot for me to say that, as I travel alone quite often. The only negative about the place itself was the fact that they didn't let anyone know that you're not allowed to flush toilet paper in their toilet (until you got there). So there was a bag hanging on nails with everyone's used toilet paper in it.

João provided us with the basics so we barely had to do any shopping for the weekend. It is ideal for a group of 3 or 4 people since there is a large bed upstairs and a sofa bed in the living room. \nIt is located in a central area so we were able to walk almost everywhere. Just a 10 minute walk to Avenida dos Aliados. If you don't want to walk, there is also a metro station and several bus stops just 5 minutes away from the apartment. Despite this, it's a very quiet area,  far enough that you don't hear any noise on the street. \nIt was a pleasure to be able to enjoy the apartment during a couple of days and to have João as a host.

João's flat is located in a very quiet section of town that is only 5 minutes walk from the Rue de Santa Catarina, the promenade with everything you need. The flat is entirely renovated: it is perfect. João also spent time helping me find a food tour, a wine tasting tour and he booked the taxi as well.  Of course he is very knowledgeable about Porto, and I tried to hit every hot spot he recommended.  If you have the time, stay there more than three nights. I should have.

En definitiva, un apartamento totalmente recomendable."},{"_id":"125707847","date":{"$date":"2017-01-07T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9248616","reviewer_id":"17565694","reviewer_name":"Ernest \u0026 Montse","comments":"todo era genial, super bien"},{"_id":"135274950","date":{"$date":"2017-03-04T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9248616","reviewer_id":"14352611","reviewer_name":"Stéphane","comments":"Appartement très agréable, très calme et avec tout le confort.

There is a washing machine, too! There was a small hiccup in terms of finding the place because I didn't have a map with me. However, eventually I got there, and my stress quickly slipped away in the comfortable bed and cheerful surroundings. The two Miguels were also quite helpful and responsive. In terms of location, it is about 3.5 city blocks from the metro. In regards to other attractions in Porto, note that everything is basically downhill from the apartment.

It’s located in a calmer sidestreet, yet in the middle of Porto. It‘s two minutes walking to the next supermarket, shopping mall, walking street, restaurants etc and 10-15 min down to the river. So an ideal location to explore the city. \n\nBesides the apartment, the warm welcome of João and all his tips where to go and what to do were an absolute highlight of our stay! I honestly was never welcomed in that lovely way in an Airbnb before. \nSo a full recommendation in any ways. \n\nOne small tip of you arrive with a rental car as we did and think about a parking spot. There is one car park literally across the street for 13€ a day, but our pro tip is to park in the Via Catarina Shopping Mall. It is only 8€ a day (which is very cheap fort Porto). The trick is that you don’t pay your ticket at the machine but with the park officers on the 6th level. \n\nSo really book this apartment an enjoy a wonderful time in Porto!"},{"_id":"364203018","date":{"$date":"2018-12-30T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9248616","reviewer_id":"71512599","reviewer_name":"Naroa","comments":"Alojamiento bonito, céntrico y con todo lo necesario para unas vacaciones.

Furthermore, The Dolphin Plaza is right downstairs, too, offering some great food and dessert options, including the legendary Koiso Sushi.\n\nKh himself is civil, kind and keeps a high standard for both customer service and house conditions.

Less than 30 minutes from the airport/Costco. Right across the street from a beach park that has good swimming, snorkeling, shade and showers. We were swimming (not snorkeling) one day, and watched about 5 turtles swim right by us! The condo is directly behind Dolphin plaza and other small plazas, which meant we could go grocery shopping, go out to eat, pick up, rent snorkel gear etc. right on our way home from the beach.\n\nGreat condo! It felt bigger than expected. We were there with our baby, and both the bedroom and the living room are big enough to put a crib/play pen in, if you need one (lots of rental places on Maui). I wasn't sure if this would be the case from the pictures. The bed is a queen size, and had a pillow top, if that's important to you.  The unit itself is close to the front of the condo complex, making it that much closer to the beach!\n\nThe unit was stocked with all the kitchen stuff you need, including a small cooler and reusable containers so you could pack a lunch with you wherever you go. There were also beach chairs and towels, and a beach umbrella. We rented snorkel gear and were all set!\n\nThe only downside was that the condo complex is strangely designed, and there was no way to avoid stairs when getting to the unit. There is an elevator, but you need to climb a flight of stairs to get to it.\n\nWe had a great time, and would definitely stay here again, and recommend it to friends and family."},{"_id":"146150271","date":{"$date":"2017-04-21T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9256784","reviewer_id":"2239273","reviewer_name":"Katrina","comments":"Great place!!!

A Dani é uma anfitriã especialíssima, não só porque nos recebeu muito bem e ajudou a montar a nossa programação turística e cultural, mas, sobretudo, porque cuida pessoalmente de tudo.

A minha comunicação com Dani foi ótima! Apesar de estar viajando Dani não deixou de se comunicar com os hospedes para saber se tudo estava bem. Dani deixou tudo organizado, encarregando uma pessoa de sua confiança para fazer o check-in.  Daniel e seu filho encontraram no aptº alguns itens de higiene pessoal, como cortesia de Dani. O apartamento faz jus ao anuncio. É limpinho, todos os eletrodomésticos funcionando, inclusive o ar condicionado. Houve apenas um pequeno probleminha com a torneira, mas tudo foi resolvido.  Para nós a localização do apartamento era boa, porque estava no caminho do nosso lugar de trabalho.  Reservamos o aptº por um período mais longo que o necessário, pois terminamos a obra antes do tempo previsto. Dani foi super gentil e devolveu  as diárias correspondentes, nem todo anfitrião tem esta postura! Somos muito gratos! O apartamento está próximo de ponto de ônibus, supermercado, farmácia.

It's a great place in a great location.  The apt is rather large, has been newly renovated and is two short blocks from Copacabana beach.  My girlfriend and I also stayed at another one of Renata’s properties nearby and really liked the Copacabana area.  There are plenty of restaurants, shops and bars close by, and of course you have a world class beach just a couple blocks away which was the main attraction for us. We also did quite a bit of walking and this apt lends itself to a 20ish minute walk to Ipanema beach and a 40ish minute walk to Leblon.  I highly recommend making those walks as you end up on a series of world class beaches the vast majority of the time and views and beaches are stellar.\r\n\r\nWorking with Renata was a pleasure. She was flat out great and has been the best host and person I have come in contact with while using airbnb.  We had a change of plans and needed to make this reservation at the last minute and she was able to accommodate. Our flight also didn't leave Rio until the late evening and she was a huge help in locating a place where we could leave our bags for the day. \r\n\r\nWe hope to make a trip to Rio again at some point and when we do we will definitely reach out to Renata.  Thanks again for all your accommodations, recommendations and help Renata.  It was all very much appreciated.

We stayed in the Green Studio (I called it) one block from Copacabana beach post 6 for 8 wonderful nights. My husband and I had to go to Rio in Nov for business and since we did not know anyone there we thought of trying out Airbnb (which is very popular in SF were we live). We were attracted by the slogan \"feel at home any part of the world\" and thats exactly how we felt in Renata's apartment, at home. By the end of our trip, we where saying to each other \"lets go home?\" Hehe.\nWhen we arrived we were greeted by Renata with so much attention and care. I felt like I was being received by a friend I'd known forever. She helped us with tips about the area, a list of restaurants and things do. When we needed her she was available and we felt so fortunate to have met her! \nThe apartment was exactly as advertised! The bed is super comfortable, tons of closet space, easy to organize for long stays, there is a sweet little kitchen and laundry tank. The building is very clean and safe too! The 24hr doormen where all super sweet and attentive. The neighbors were friendly with us. We felt very safe in the building. We loved the neighborhood and the location and made a lot of friends there. We would walk to the beach and back several times per day. \nThe location is prime, I would give a super high walk score, we walked everywhere! The supermarket was one block away, the pharmacy is on the corner, the post office, restaurants, bars, stores, shopping centers, and flea markets are all walkable. The taxis stop in front of the building and the bus runs on the streets above (to Leblon, Ipanema and Barra da Tijuca) and  below (Leme, Lapa and the city Center). Over all we were super satisfied with our stay! We will for sure come back and stay with Renata next time!

The space is clean with lots of light and 24-hour security. We had access to large closets which is helpful to avoid the \"living out of a suitcase\" look. The apartment is also very close to the beach in a safe neighbourhood and is walking distance to the metro. \r\n\r\nRenata herself is a gracious host with lots of good recommendations on what to do in the city and how to get around. She is very accomodating, bringing us water and treats. Most importantly, she responds to messages quickly both before we arrived in Rio and afterwards, to ensure that we have a pleasant stay. She also speaks excellent English!\r\n\r\nI would highly recommend staying at Renata's apartment if you're planning a trip to Rio. I've stayed in airbnbs all over the world and it's always great to meet a host to takes pride in her space and in her city.

We traveled with an infant and was able to set up a crib in the entry (in essence we were able to make it into a two bedroom). The doormen were kind and helpful (when we arrived early they got in contact with Renata for us-- which was nice since we do not speak any Portuguese). Renata gave us some great food recommendations. A short walk from the apartment will bring you to the beach, numerous restaurants, and stores. Everything else (tourist attractions) is a short taxi ride away. Comfortable bed, necessities in the kitchen, hot shower, clean room, quiet apartment building (nice neighbors) and working AC. Would stay here again.

There's a big world map made of cork (which is one of materials typically used in Porto, not only for bottling but also for arts and crafts) fixed at the wall of the dining room where the guests mark with a pin the place they're coming from (ours were Italy, Galicia and Argentina). We were also given a complimentary bottle of white wine, which, by the way, was really good. The neighborhood is nice and safe, there's a big market just a 10-minutes walk (Mercado Bom Sucesso) with gourmet food (try the leitão), stalls of fruit (delicious clementines from the Azores) and fish. Just around the corner, close to the metro station, you can find some terrific pastéis de nata and a very good coffee at Cake Studio. If instead you're looking for a square meal after a day of rambling walks, then, just crossing the street, there's Restaurante Universal which has excellent reviews (but unfortunately we didn't try). Nightlife around Galerias de Paris, its beatiful buildings with their tiled façades and hundreds of small quirky bars is not more than 20 minutes on foot. Portuguese people are extremely friendly anyway, so, if you're unsure on where to go, just ask! Back to the apartment, we noticed a lot of nice little details: a book in English on every nightstand, a paper with the forecast for the next few days. Quick tip: opening the main door could be tricky, as one of the two locks is down at the bottom of the door. Gião was also extra-accomodating with check-in and check-out times."},{"_id":"61209832","date":{"$date":"2016-02-01T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9280084","reviewer_id":"7683784","reviewer_name":"Sara","comments":"Pedro welcomed us warmly to his flat in Porto and was very flexible on check-in and check-out time.

E o apartamento de Steve é perfeito, pela localização, perto ou de fácil acesso a todos os pontos de interesse, bastante confortável, com tudo que precisamos e lindo. A atenção de Steve para conosco nos encantou. Ele deixou sugestões de bares, restaurantes, pontos turístico e juntamente com sua assistente Griet nos acolheu com total atenção, antes de chegarmos à Barcelona, durante toda a nossa estadia e depois. O fato de o apartamento estar no segundo andar, não atrapalha em nada, pois quem conhece a Europa sabe que prédios antigos não dispõem de elevador. A rua é agradável e o flat fica juntinho do Rubi, um agradável pub, que tem o moçambicano Simonal (homenagem a um músico brasileiro) para uma agradável conversa sobre música. A rua é bastante silenciosa e, para quem ficar no flat, sugiro passar algumas horas na pequena varanda, comtemplando a movimentação, a qualquer hora, de preferência tomando um bom vinho.

We especially enjoyed the location in charming old historical neighbourhood and everything(shops, F\u0026B outlets, tourist attractions etc) is near and the area feels quite safe even quite late at night. Since we stayed during July and the temparture was quite high(28-30c), it was a bit tough without aircon and one fan in the apartment. We kept windows wide opened every nights.

He and his assistant(s) were also great in helping with a smooth check-in. The location of the flat was great, just a few blocks from a metro stop. It was decently quiet, being on a traffic-free pedestrian street, with a little noise from the bar/restaurant below and next door.  \r\n\r\nThe Barcelona travel books were very helpful and inspired a day trip into La Costa Brava for us. The included printer was also very useful and easy to use for printing tickets and confirmations. The kitchen was modern and well stocked with cookware and coffee makers. The water could get quite hot and never ran out for baths. The washer was also great to have for our week-long stay, which helped us pack relatively light. Quite spacious for two, and decent for four, though the bathroom is only accessibly through the bedroom. Overall, definitely recommended!

The metro station and a supermarket for groceries are available in five walking minutes only, so is the harbour and the „Arc de Triomf“. The museum of Picasso is just around the corner.\r\n\r\nIn the apartment there is one double bed and an extra air matrace for another two people. The kitchen is well equipped with all the necessary things you need for cooking and even includes a microwave and a dish washer. Also there is a washing mashine that you can feel free to use. The style and decoration make it a very comfortable place to stay during holidays.\r\n\r\nWe spent one week in this beautiful flat. Unfortunately, we didn’t meet Steven in person, but he prepared our stay very well (for example by a map he did himself that includes information about all important places in the neighbourhood) and sent his friend Isabelle to give us the keys and help us with the first orientation in Barcelona.

Fairmount Bagel taste is good! :)"},{"_id":"77616332","date":{"$date":"2016-06-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9297414","reviewer_id":"15429555","reviewer_name":"Anne","comments":"Zoe's apartment was immaculate and the photos represented it accurately. I really appreciated this because I'd just come from another AirBnb which was messy \u0026 super-lived in! Getting the keys was easy, and the neighborhood was okay. It's a safe, pretty, residential neighborhood, not at all touristy, which was great --  but there aren't a ton of restaurants \u0026 services right near by, so some might prefer to stay in a neighborhood with more cafes, etc. But the spaciousness \u0026 cleanliness of Zoe's very cute apartment were great. \r\n\r\nA couple of things to note: There is a long flight of stairs to the apartment (you enter the front door \u0026 then come to the flight of stairs once inside). This would be difficult for anyone with mobility issues, anyone dealing with a young child -- stroller, etc. -- or an elderly person with a cane or walker. \r\n\r\nAnd although the kitchen had brand-new stove, electric kettle, French press coffee pot, good selection of knives, it would have been wonderful to have a microwave. When you're in a city for only a night or two or three, it's really nice to be able to heat up take-out quickly, without having to bother with the oven!\r\n\r\nThe TV had Netflix on it \u0026 I watched  a movie one night, which was great, and the shower was wonderful!\r\n\r\nBut all in all, a great place to stay.

Her flexibility in this regard was a huge help and made our trip so much easier! Thank you!\r\nThe apartment was exactly as described, and really warm, cosy and welcoming.\r\nShe left fresh flowers, fruit, water, juice, eggs, milk and snacks for us. It was so great to have these supplies having only just arrived in New York.  \r\nThe flat felt very secure and was an easy block's walk to the subway station. The journey into Manhattan was a little longer than I'd anticipated, although as we spent all day outside exploring it didn't matter so much.\r\nOn the upside, there are loads of Uber cabs in the area and I can recommend using the Uberpool, which makes rides in Brooklyn really cheap :-)\r\nThe wifi was working impeccably so we had no problem booking a few taxis.\r\nThe flat was spotlessly clean and well provided for in terms of dishes, pots and pans. The laundry facilities were a huge bonus.\r\nAshley checked up on how we were regularly. We never met in person, which was a great pity, but we also valued the privacy she gave us.\r\nI would 100% recommend staying at Ashley's place and would definitely come again.

The photo is a bit deceiving as it shows the apartment to be upstairs.  It is actually a downstairs basement apartment with very little natural light.  The neighborhood is nice.  I felt safe walking around.  Go one block over and it changes, but that's typical in NY.  There was an issue with the cleaning person, and we could not check in by 4p, but were told the place would be ready by 7p.  The space plenty big enough for a family of four, although the pull-out beds on the sofas were really uncomfortable, even for teens and they'll sleep most anywhere.  All you could feel were springs.  The floor was sticky and the bathroom smelled like a cat had been there before us.  Pets are allowed which is awesome.  We loved the outdoor space.  Our host left us some breakfast items, coffee and plenty of towels.  Checkout is at 12n which is great. Good communication with the host.  Like I said, for the money, it was a good experience.

From small things such as washing up liquid and sponges in the apartment, to a bbq outside, this apartment was ready for people to arrive and it made it so much easier not having to worry about going to a shop straight away to pick up small things. \nThe apartment is really close to the subway station which was great, we often came back really late at night and there was no issue. I should point out that there is no elevator from the street to the the subway, so it did mean having to lift the double buggy up and down the stairs. But, we found that this is a common issue throughout New York! \nCommunication with Ashley was brilliant.

She answered each question immediately and even randomly messaged us to check in on our stay. We felt safe in the neighborhood, only had to walk a few short walks to the subway stations, and were able to wash our clothes each day. What stuck out to me the most were the little touches she put to welcome us into her home. Everything from cereal and milk to filtered water to a bottle of wine completely put our stay over the top. I think that’s what sets apart all AirBnBs, the small “extras” help guests feel more comfortable and wanted.

Our family of 4 felt very safe being in her entire apartment with virtually no noise from neighboring apartments or upstairs at nighttime. We loved the amenities at your place, especially the bath tub and spacious toilet that usually is non-existence in Hong Kong.

All the appliances are new and in good repair, and the furnishings are comfortable and stylish. \r\n\r\nEric is a great host. He was there to greet us and make sure we got settled in okay. He even checked-in part way through our stay to ask how we were doing, which was very thoughtful. Eric also left us great information about the attractions and amenities around the neighbourhood—another thoughtful, personal touch!\r\n\r\nIf you're looking to stay in a great part of Montreal and have a fantastic host, I happily recommend Eric and his apartment.

I slept in the very comfortable bed.  My friend choose the couch which folded down into a bed, rather than those pull out couch mattresses which can be uncomfortable.

The police station was literally our next door neighbor and the apartment is facing the police station parking lot, so it must be one of the safest places in the downtown core. \r\n\r\nEverything inside the apartment was in as new condition, the kitchen was very well equipped and Erick was kind enough to leave a full supply basic items such as  dishwasher and laundry detergent , toilet paper, etc... so we didn't need to buy anything other than food in the first few days. \r\n\r\nI was there with my wife and 2 young daughters and the apartment was functional and airy enough that we didn't feel crowded.

The location is convenient for walking around Waikiki and there is limited parking on property (first come first served basis). The place is a bit small but still the description is accurate. The exception is that there is no wifi in the unit. Apparently there used to be but the building changed internet providers recently and wifi is no longer available by entering a code. In fairness I didn't give this feedback to Nobu and give him a chance to fix it because I felt there would not be a solution and that it would be a waste of time.

The room was exactly has specified in the page, quite comfortable and with more than I expected, specially in the kitchen. The neighborhood was completely a tourist area, with open mini-marts open till really late hours and close by. I always felt safe in and out of the hotel. The location was walking distance to most of the attractions Waikiki has to offer. No need to rent a car if you're an active person. The people all around are friendly and courteous. The view from the rooftop is breathtaking and the all around maintnance of the hotel was clean and neat. I would definitely stay here again in a not so distant future and also recommended to everybody I know. Weather wise, it was sunny, breezy, cool and great for a stroll even at night.

Towels, beach necessities, appliances, utensils, plates etc. There was also a laundry room on the premises(was able to clean everything on last day). The room was worth the price we paid for.

A lot of this has to do with simplicity and straightforward nature of Nobu and his studio at the Waikiki Grand. The studio was clean, and had all of the necessary amenities. The location was key, as it is located close to free parking (if you want to rent a car) and Waikiki beach. You will have to walk a bit if you want to go to the western side of Waikiki but we found ourselves gravitating towards the restaurants lining Kapahulu Ave. Nobu was very accommodating. He was quick to answer any question and give suggestions. He is as involved as you need him to be. Everything was straight forward and it resulted in a good experience. If you are visiting Waikiki and intend on renting a car and exploring the whole island, this would be a very good and affordable option."},{"_id":"77812052","date":{"$date":"2016-06-03T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9334038","reviewer_id":"56925458","reviewer_name":"Angelo","comments":"Nice clean place.

He even has a beach umbrella, beach mats, beach bags, body boards, chair, snorkeling gear, and beach towels stocked for you to use. More than enough bath towels for use as well. Only issue I noticed was that there was no bathroom fan or one that worked. The only way to airout the bathroom was by the window. Even so, it still felt musty inside of it. If your window is slightly open, people outside can potentially have a closer look inside by pushing the shutter open since it’s a louver style window. Luckily we didn’t have any issues with peeping toms. Overall, the place was great. The best takeaways from Nobu’s place is that it’s located right across the Honolulu Zoo parking lot, which allows hourly parking.  Having the extra beach equipment also saved me a lot of money and made beach days more convenient.

His place is beautiful, clean and has a washer and dryer. He always responded in a timely manner to any question we may have had. He greeted us with wine and bagels with cream cheese for the next morning. The apartment had everything you could think of and then some. His kitchen was even stocked with ingredients for a pasta meal. He also recommended a great place to eat for Greek food and it was delicious.

On walking into this exceptional studio, I can say his pictures do not do it justice. It is an absolutely lovely place to stay. Not only was there everything that we needed inside (including chocolates!) Kevin was kind enough to let us BBQ chicken for our little graduation party and made sure we had propane for the grill. Anything we needed he had!  Most excellent beach chairs ever, great snorkels and fins and he even let us borrow some chairs to take to kids apt for the party. Additionally he even included a great write up sheet regarding nearby places to go and eat.

His home is convenient to Diamond Head and Waikiki Beaches--we had a rental car and having a dedicated parking space was very convenient.  The condo is clean, tastefully furnished and had all the conveniences a traveler would need.  The appliances are all new and modern.  The amenities (towels, soaps and supplies) were all first-rate. We appreciated the welcome basket Kevin left for us-- it included Kona coffee, chocolates and bottled water.  The bed was very comfortable and the air conditioning worked well (the apartment has a washer and dryer but we did not use them).

He even left us a gift basket for us to enjoy during our stay. The beach amenities (beach towels/chairs/umbrella, snorkeling gear, boogie boards) are an added plus. One thing the pictures don't show is a huge closet equipped with hangers and a drying rack. I assume past guests have left behind hair dryers and an iron since the listing shows that those are not available, so no need to bring those. We also left a travel sized garment steamer for future guests to use. Overall, we very much enjoyed our stay and we would be more than happy to stay here again.

I would highly recommend Kevin's place and will happily return if given the chance.

No rattan or loud floral; refreshing.  Loved the outdoor shower with the little nautical light on top -- awesome little touch.  Greenery all around.  I sat out front at the little table (so private) and had delicious (complimentary) coffee in the mornings and tried to soak in all the chill beautiful vibes before I had to go back to LA.\nLoved that we could park right in the driveway.  It's a downstairs unit but it was so quiet... we could hardly hear any footsteps from above.  We could walk to Kaimuki and Kahala and even Waikiki.  \nThe communication was amazing also.  Didn't get to meet Kevin in person, but he was so clear and welcoming in his emails from the start to finish.\nThis is the only Airbnb that I am seriously going to try hard to book again in the future.

Her and Alex were extremely nice, as we got to spend some time talking to them on their lovely patio. The room is on the opposite side of the house so we had plenty of privacy, along with our own bathroom which was a plus! It got pretty hot since there is no air conditioner, but they provided a fan that helped a lot at night. Since we weren't there much during the day it was not an issue! \n\nWe would definitely recommend their apartment room!"}]}

Before heading to the airport, Tito Ken and Gab treated us some milk tea, pineapple bun and another cute-looking bread, incredibly delicious.\r\nGreat food, great people and a very memorable travel with my family… Thank you so much!"},{"_id":"64676533","date":{"$date":"2016-03-06T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9372696","reviewer_id":"60210379","reviewer_name":"梦雪","comments":"第一次用airbnb订房,本来挺担心安全问题的,不过,这家宾馆的评论都很好,而且房东也很热情,有问必答,所以,我最终订了房,事实证明,这是一个很正确的决定｡宾馆的地理位置很方便,可以走去庙街,九龙公园,甚至海港城等,离旺角也就一个地铁站,如果认识路,完全可以走过去~房间也挺大的,我165cm,不会睡不下,还有桌子和电视,wifi也很快｡厕所挺大的,不过几个房间一起用,所以,每天都是厕所争夺战(¯▽¯)噪音问题也不大,不过香港的车都开得好快,车声比较大｡房东很温柔也很好人,还请我们吃了很好吃的椰挞｡重点来了,我离开香港去到关口,才发现,通行证不见了!!把行李翻了很多次,都没有,打开 (Hidden by Airbnb) ,才知道,漏在宾馆了,只能打车回去拿了,350的打车费,真心心疼,所以大家一定要看好,检查好通行证再走,挂失要一天,如果没有身份证要三天｡当然,也很感谢房东告诉了我,其实房东在我离开香港前已经发 (Hidden by Airbnb) 给我了,可是我没有流量,所以没看到,说真的,弄一张香港的电话卡吧!没有流量,不能打电话,其实真的很不方便,我就试过逛街找不到朋友,各种找,各种等,很不方便｡还有,这次旅行遇到了很多好人,有提醒我身份证掉了的,有提醒我背包拉链忘记拉上的(两次忘记拉上都没有不见东西),有主动指路的,有热心帮忙拍照的,大家都很好,所以,这次旅行还是挺好的~我们都很满意,也已经推荐给了朋友们,下次去香港也会再订的~"},{"_id":"66206922","date":{"$date":"2016-03-20T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9372696","reviewer_id":"59251872","reviewer_name":"Ling Ur","comments":"Great location."},{"_id":"67071277","date":{"$date":"2016-03-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9372696","reviewer_id":"48437122","reviewer_name":"Dewi","comments":"Ken and Zyla was a great house.

Look no further than Zyla's Guest House in Jordan, Kowloon. HK is known to have many high-risers, tight spaces, and mimic urban metropolis China in many ways. For any FIRST-TIME travelers (like I was), I did thorough vigilant research on the best, most cost-effective place to stay in HK and Zyla's was the best! For under $50 nightly, you get your own private bedroom and access to 2 communal bathrooms and some kitchen appliances/amenities.  You also will realize quickly, HK is split into 2 main regions- Kowloon and Hong Kong Island. I recommend staying in Kowloon as it is closer to the airport and the fun areas were closer and within walking distance. HK Island's areas were more spreadout and most of the island is inaccessible anyway due to nature. Zyla's Guest House is located in a quiet building on Austin/Nathan Road. It's also a 5 minute walk to the Jordan MTR station which is amazing! 7-11, Starbucks, and McDonalds are all right across/within walking distance. Service was also amazing. Zyla responds to messages and inquiries within 24 hours. I had the pleasure of interacting with her, her husband Ken, and the caretaker Kok who is there 24/7 mostly. Zyla and her husband do not reside in the guest house but come frequently (if not, daily) to check in on the AirBnb. All my accommodations were met- fast WIFI, towels, bathroom/shower access, drinking water, microwave, etc. There will be other guest coming in 'n out, but I did not experience any rudeness/loudness :) HK is a humid country, so your A/C will be on most of the time when you're in the room. With a small space, make sure to handle your space/luggage well! Otherwise, enjoy Zyla's Guest House and Hong Kong!"},{"_id":"105057811","date":{"$date":"2016-09-30T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9372696","reviewer_id":"54157533","reviewer_name":"Kyoungsug","comments":"조단역에서 가까운 오래된 맨션으로 방이 너무작고 에어컨 소리크고 모기많고 , 와이프랑 애들이 너무 불편해해서 방 옮겼네요.\r\n가족들에겐 비추입니다."},{"_id":"105777447","date":{"$date":"2016-10-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9372696","reviewer_id":"81415107","reviewer_name":"Michael","comments":"The place is at the heart of the city, you can ride mtrs and buses to any key points of hong kong.

She rented out a spot in the garage to me for $10/day, which I didn't mind paying for because finding street parking in Waikiki is impossible.

It wasnt bad for the price at all. I just needed a bed for the night. The room does get extremely loud at night, so if you cant sleep with noises then it'll be troublesome. Also, beware of the slamming door! I did also find the curtain a litttttle too small for the window considering I was facing other apartments which nade it hard to change.

The room is like a dorm room.  As advertised, it's small and very bare bones.  It's a great location if you just need a place to crash for the night.  Only one window in the room opens and there's a lot of street noise at night.  You can't close the window, however, since there is a lack of AC and without the window and fan, it would be very uncomfortable.  I'd recommend ear plugs if you have them.  The apartment itself is extremely tiny and there is no living room space.  There is a kitchen area with a table and a couple of chairs if you want to hang out but I felt discouraged from doing so.  When my friend and I were chatting at the table at 7:20pm we got scolded for talking too loudly because one of the girls could have been sleeping (which it turned out she wasn't).  We didn't even know if any of the other girls were home since the other ladies are fairly private.  The rental is very close to the beach and a lot of shopping too so that's a bonus.  Overall, this is a great place if you just need to crash for a night or are really strapped for cash."},{"_id":"105340305","date":{"$date":"2016-10-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9379792","reviewer_id":"67270837","reviewer_name":"彩香","comments":"たまたまﾎｽﾄの方は不在だったのですが､代わりの方が快く迎えてれてよかったです｡ｸﾘｰﾝな部屋で､ﾊﾞｽ停も近く､立地も良いと思います｡"},{"_id":"105726180","date":{"$date":"2016-10-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9379792","reviewer_id":"9218744","reviewer_name":"Milly","comments":"Very accessible and just as described.

Perfect for the low maintenance traveller who wants something simple and private. I love the city noise at night and having a kitchen available as an option. My room had a clothes rack and hangers and a little table and chair so I could really unpack and settle in. It was just perfect. The self check in was a new feature that was really helpful, too.

The apartment is right in Waikiki and much cheaper than a hotel. However, there are a few small changes that could and should be made to this unit. For instance,  there is a 6 inch gap between the top of the door and the ceiling allowing the kitchen light to come pouring in at night. When I tried to turn it off one evening someone just turned it back on. It was nearly impossible to keep it dark. Second, the walls are paper thin. Sounds like people are drag racing outside the building at 2 am. So bring ear plugs. Mostly the gap above the door bothered me. Seems like a simple fix. Otherwise I enjoyed my stay.

As a first time international traveller, staying at Tomoko's all female apartment made me feel very safe. From the beginning prior to coming to my destination, Tomoko was very accomodating and helpful in regards to communication and answering questions with early check in. On arrival, I was fortunate enough to meet Tomoko as I was entering the apartment block and she helped me get the keys. She had clear instructions throughout our communication. The place was better than i expected! The room was so cute,  and both room and bathroom was so clean! Bed was comfortable and there was also a fan in the room. Earplugs were available to use as it was quite noisy due to the thin walls but only used it on the first night as i got used to the outside noise quickly. I would definitely stay here again and recommend Tomoko's place for first time travellers or frequent solo travelers for an affordable, clean and awesome place to live that was only less than 7 minutes walk from Waikiki Beach. The apartment was 1 minute walk from a main bus stop and 2 minutes walk to the nearest ABC store and cafes! Overall 10/10 place to stay.

I believe I had the smallest bedroom, which didn't bother me much as I mainly only used it for sleeping, maybe a tiny table and some light next to the bed for reading would help a bit, but these are really just some small extras. So the place is great and the host is great, too, very responsive and kind, helpful.

I dare say that it is the best accommodatin I have ever found in Cheung Chau.\r\n\r\nYan and Robin is a nice and friendly couple with exceptional taste in different aspects of living: books, furniture, food, etc. They are willing to suggest where we should visit during our stay (e.g. the delicious chilli chicken pot!) and tell us how to get there in detail. They have paid attention to every detail to guarantee they are providing first-class service. It is indeed our honor and fortunate to be their second pair of guests. \r\n\r\nWhen we arrived at the pier, my girlfriend and I took time to walk around the commercial area and visited the catholic church nearby, and then Robin came and showed us the way to his home. Although his house is located at the middle of a hill, it is not far away from the commercial area. The road to his house is quiet and well-maintained; it is not physically demanding to walk through it even we were with our luggage.\r\n\r\nAfter entering the gate of his house, Robin led us through a large garden to the veranda, which is facing a marvelous and astonishing view of the coast. My girlfriend and I enjoyed reading books there during daytime. At night, it would become so romantic to stay there when the star-shaped light decorations hanging from the ceiling are all turned on. Next to the veranda is the indoor pool area. As the weather was turning cold these days, it felt so warm inside it. It is decorated with plants and oriental style decorations and furniture. It made me feel like I had travelled to Bali. \r\n\r\nThe sitting room and our bedroom are spacious, clean and well-lighted. The interior design is in harmony with the outdoor area. As soon as we had settled ourselves in the sitting room, Robin served us hot tea and traditional local pastries. Then he gave us the key of our room - they have attached a mini flashlight to the key ring, and it helped us a lot when we were looking for our way back to the house at night. The next morning, Yan was so nice to have prepared some fruits and her homemade bread for our breakfast. The jazz music played in the sitting room was just excellent (my girlfriend and I even danced).\r\n\r\nWe will always remember Robin and Yan and our time staying at their place. We will definitely come again the next time we visit Cheung Chau.\r\n"},{"_id":"56008423","date":{"$date":"2015-12-07T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9395165","reviewer_id":"17070072","reviewer_name":"Rong","comments":"Beautiful, Amazing, Fantastic...for the house \nConsiderate, Warmly ...for Robin and Yen .\nI'm afraid that I describe it  in English isn't accurate,so I can only use a few key words to express it. \nAnd I'm very lucky to have afternoon tea and delicious breakfast that  Robin and Yen provided specially.\nI consider it's my best experience in Hong K\nong.

E.g. Making breakfast, giving fruits, exchanging culture, etc. This house faced with a overview for a corner of the sea in this island, it is enjoyable for visitors to do anything at the yard of their house when facing the sea. And there are two lovely and friendly dogs, Ella and Pepper, both of the dogs are nice to people, you don't have to be afraid of being bite by them and it would be wonderful if you are a dog friendly person. The bathroom is quiet clean, shampoo and shower gel are supplied, also clean towers. Robin have so many ideas for recommending trip routes or restaurant, you could ask him if u haven't make any plans. I would say this is a fabulous place to take rest when enjoying vacation.

The place is 10min's walk to the ferry pier or to the beach \u0026 swimming site.

I am full of gratitude for the kind, generous warm hospitality as well as genuine interest in ensuring I had everything I needed.\n\nIn terms of tips that might help other travellers, other than the \"don't hesitate and book now\" cliché, I would probably mention:\n1) The house is uphill from the ferry. Therefore try to pack light.\n2) Be sure to go for sushi and tea at the Hometown tea house. If you have time, stop by for a photo and chat; and sign the guest book as well.\n3) The internet on Cheung Chau has a reputation for being patchy by HK standards, particularly during storms. By European standards it was more than adequate for accessing files over the company VPN.\n4) Try to visit mid-week when the island is practically devoid of other visitors.

Cheung Chau is a charming island, less than an hour by ferry from the piers at Central, but has managed to preserve a traditional feel, with a working harbour, no cars, narrow streets, plentiful inexpensive restaurants, sandy beaches and multiple walks around the island. Wen and Robin’s delightful house is a 15 mins walk uphill from the ferry in an excellent location overlooking the sea. Unusually for Hong Kong, the house, both inside and out, has plenty of space, including a large terrace, spacious open plan dining and living room, pool room with plunge pool, separate bathroom with a shower for guests, and a well-appointed bedroom with air con, large double bed and good storage.

Same deal with internet and a million movie choices; everything works. Beautiful wood floors; just like in the photos. What they don`t tell, is that Craig is a jazz luminary; we asked with whom he`s played, and he said \" pretty much , everybody \"...   and he has !  I saw Sun Ra more than 30 years ago at Chicago Jazz fest, and Craig might have been in the band !  My husband told me he has tried to buy some apparently rare  CD`s that Craig composed, or produced and they were available in the $300 range. We only learned as we were leaving.

Diane and Craig are great hosts. We didn't meet Diane but she was very quick answering to our questions before our arrival, helping us with different information and all that showed fantastic professionality and responsability. When we landed, we had some issues with the phone connection but still we sorted it out quickly. We got into the apartment as soon as we arrived without a problem. We met Craig and his brother and they were very helpful too. Craig gave us all the information we needed when we arrived and he was also available at any time if we had any problem.  \r\nThe apartment is fantastic and big enough for everything. It is even better than in the pictures. It has natural light all around and it really makes you feel like at home. You have absolutely everything you need,  and as I said, we travelled with a baby and all his different baby needs, and we felt home :) \r\nEverything was very clean and super comfortable bed with plenty of room for the three of us. You also have other room and an inflatable bed that you could place in the main room. Although we were at the top floor and we had to carry a stroller, it was not an issue. \r\nThe central heating works perfectly well and the apartment is nice and warm. But if you travel in summer, there are fans all around the apartment, so it should be nice and fresh too.\r\nThe neighbourhood is very safe. We were walking around late at night (New Year's Eve, and the rest of the days at about 22.30/23 some days, one of them just on my own after a Broadway musical) and not a problem. You have cheap supermarkets and restaurants around. Harlem is a great neighbourhood, very  beautiful, full of culture and really exciting.\r\nMoreover, The apartment is very well connected to the city centre. Lines 2 and 3 take you everywhere and you are in times square in 15 minutes as the most. The subway station is two blocks round the corner (more or less 3 minutes walking from the apartment). It works 24 h and with the metrocard you have unlimited trips for one week both by bus and subway. :) \r\nEVERYTHING is ABSOLUTELY POSITIVE about the apartment, the neighbourhood, the location and the hosts. I recommend this place to everyone.I already recommended it to all my family and friends wishing to visit NYC :)\r\nWithout a doubt, if any time we come back to NYC, this will be our first choice!\r\nThank you very much for everything!!!!\r\nWe enjoyed our stay to the maximum and We spent a fantastic week of holidays.

Diane made sure we felt welcome by establishing communication before we arrived and ensuring we had all necessary contact information for when we arrived. The listing was as described, and we were thrilled to find a blender in addition to add to our meal options. The two air conditioners installed in the windows were on full blast for the duration of the stay due to the heat, and we were certainly relieved to have them! The neighbourhood was, as a friend residing in New York put it, \"an up-and-coming trendy place to be but still a bit messy.\" We felt safe walking around during the day and in groups at night, but I don't think I would have walked by myself at night as a lonely female. Regardless, everyone we met in the neighbourhood was respectful and helpful and the businesses were clean and professional inside even if there were interesting characters outside. It wasn't really much different than riding the subway with a plethora of interesting characters anyways. For a good price and quick access to the subways, groceries and restaurants, the apartment was definitely a good place to stay. We were absolutely satisfied and would recommend it. \r\n"},{"_id":"43383243","date":{"$date":"2015-08-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"939657","reviewer_id":"35719804","reviewer_name":"Faustino","comments":"\r\nLa casa es muy confortable, bien equipada, limpia y se correspondió con las fotos del anuncio.\r\nEstá bien comunicada y el barrio fue seguro."},{"_id":"45071854","date":{"$date":"2015-08-31T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"939657","reviewer_id":"26873733","reviewer_name":"Sandra","comments":"Diane was a wonderful and helpful host giving us hints on restaurants, parking, metro stops, etc. the apartment is perfectly located about three blocks from the metro stop and from the tour bus that we used. there is a grocery store two blocks away, reasonable and covered parking two blocks away and restaurants galore. the apartment is more than adequate for 2 to 4 people and we enjoyed the stay very much. we would recommend this as a great value in a great location; we are planning to return to the apartment in the future."},{"_id":"47959635","date":{"$date":"2015-09-22T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"939657","reviewer_id":"6830922","reviewer_name":"Chris","comments":"Beautifully finished property in an exciting community.

Pleasant hike to upper end of Central Park, and just a few blocks to get to subway.  We found it easy to get hold of Uber when necessary as well. I've stayed in Manhattan many times before  and this was among the best of experiences, despite the need to think a little further ahead of time to get to the Theater District and other places of interest further downtown -- on the other hand, we really enjoyed getting to know Harlem, and finally made it to The Cloisters in Washington Heights, too.

The kitchen had all we needed to cook almost every night. There is a smaller room that can accommodate one person and that is handy if you are travelling with a child or a third adult. The apartment was on the top floor of three and you have to navigate a narrow staircase. Staying in Harlem is an experience on many levels. It can be noisy at times and sirens continuously wail. That said we never felt unsafe and freely walked the streets. For a different New York experience, the Red Door and hosts Diane and Craig would be hard to beat.

The flat looks like in the uploaded pictures - you can find there nearly everything you may need during the stay. There were beddings, sheets, towels, availabels, as long as the kitchen equipment (dishwasher, washing machine, oven, glasses, plates, cutlery etc.) and some may be happy with hair dryer as well. There is also air conditioner in the flat (can be really useful sometimes). The apartment is not located in the city center, but it definitely is not a problem - the communication with the city center and other districts is great thanks to the underground (3 minutes walk) and the RENFE trains (direct connection with the El Prat airport). \r\nNear the apartment you can find supermarkets, bakery, fruit market etc. \r\nIt took us ca 25 minutes to get to the beach with slow, holiday walk pace.\r\nCommunication with Francesco was smooth and he answered all our questions before the arrival and during the stay.  \r\nTo sum up, we were very happy with the apartment and the stay itself, you'll be too! :) "},{"_id":"5389497","date":{"$date":"2013-06-27T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"940374","reviewer_id":"2630715","reviewer_name":"Steven","comments":"Very nice modern apartment in great area of Barcelona.

Francesco nous a fourni le nécessaire de ménage, produits d'entretien, sac poubelle, éponge, etc et également huile, vinaigre, sucre, sel et une bouteille d'eau au frais dans le frigo pour nous accueillir.\r\nSalle de bain de belle taille avec une baignoire à remous (très agréable pour la détente après une journée de balade touristique)\r\nla chambre bien spacieuse pour deux avec un débarras pour les valises avec penderie et une petite armoire. le lit confortable (à notre goût). L'immeuble et le quartier tranquilles et sans bruit pour un bon sommeil récupérateur après nos kilomètres de visites.\r\nle séjour fort agréable avec une table pour quatre et un bureau pour l'ordinateur avec le réseau internet direct.\r\nL'appartement est idéalement situé dans une petite rue tranquille à 200 mètres d'une bouche de métro à 2 stations de la Sagrada Familia.\r\nHormis les petits commerces, boulangerie, épicerie, primeurs, pharmacie et le marché couvert situés dans les alentours, les amateurs de grands centres commerciaux seront ravis de se rendre au \"Glories\" un grand centre aux pieds de la tour Agbar  (le suppositoire) à 10 minutes à pieds.\r\nEn résumé Francesco et son appartement ont contribué pour une bonne part à la réussite de notre super séjour à Barcelone."},{"_id":"26003000","date":{"$date":"2015-02-01T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"940374","reviewer_id":"1274934","reviewer_name":"Andrew And Tanya","comments":"This place was fantastic!

We stayed in Francesco's apartment for a week, and could have happily stayed for a month. Francesco was so helpful in the lead up to the trip and even throughout the holiday, sending us a nice message halfway through the week to check in and see how we were enjoying our stay. The apartment itself is exactly how you see it in the pictures and is super clean. He quite literally provides you with everything you could need in the apartment from towels, to a hairdryer, clothes rack, domestic products from washing detergent to surface cleaner and even spare toothbrushes (new in the packet of course). He had also given us a fresh bottle of mineral water which he had kept cold in the fridge for us, as he explained that although the tap water was drinkable, it sometimes doesn't taste too nice as the we were so close to the sea. We enjoyed spending every morning and evening relaxing on the balcony, which was such a bonus. \r\n\r\nIn terms of location, the apartment is quite literally in the most perfect place. The RENFE station is honestly 30 seconds away and the METRO is only 2 minutes away. The neighbourhood is a lovely place, and we felt so safe staying there. It has its own share of restaurants and bars which are nice, but it really takes no effort to catch a metro and experience the food and drink places that the rest of Barcelona has to offer. There is a park just around the corner also, and it really is a cool place. It is just under a 10 minute walk to get to the nearest supermarket (Carrefour) where there is also a shopping centre around it.  \r\n\r\nI could go on and on about the apartment and it's surrounding area. I cannot recommend this apartment enough!

Personable, charismatic, friendly, and really patient with his guests.

Location isn't recommended if you wish to be right in the middle of the action like (las ramblas, eixample, etc ) but great for those who love quiet. Still a bit of a walk to Sagrada Familia but in that general area. It's a vast city so it is what it is there. \n\nEverything else is taxi ride away. Walk outside and you get a real taste of the local life away from the crowds of tourists. For us, starting with a walk to the park next door and witnessing the locals play futball/soccer was a cool experience, following up with some local paella and beer which btw is \"muy bueno\" and insanely cheap. \n\nIn terms of the place itself, we have no complaints. Bed is comfy for a large bunk bed, kitchen has all the amenities you need (including a washer!), the bathroom offers an amazing shower/bathtub spa with jets, and there is a balcony with a semi decent view (plus a terrace upstairs for a nice panoramic!) \n\nOverall, we were impressed and would recommend Francesco's place to anyone."},{"_id":"191171460","date":{"$date":"2017-09-06T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"940374","reviewer_id":"55475355","reviewer_name":"Brittany","comments":"Francesco's place was clean and comfortable.

Франческо предоставил нам 2 кроватки, постельное для детей (+сменное), несколько игрушек и даже спальные мешки. Мы эти вещи везли с собой из Украины, но было очень приятно такое внимание и забота!  Покорила бутылка холодной воды и кофе для кофемашины - то самое, что было нам так необходимо после дороги :)  В апартаментах индивидуальное отопление - тоже было очень важно нам с детьми. \nРасположение удобное - пару минут от станции Clot.  Мы как раз ехали до этой станции из аэропорта (к поезду лифт есть). Правда, так и не разобрались есть ли лифт (нам с коляской для двойни нужен именно лифт) на линию метро L1, так что когда была необходимость - прогуливались до станции Glories - это всего в 7 минутах ходьбы. Там же огромный супермаркет.  Супермаркет поменьше есть и в пару кварталов от апартаментов.\nНеподалеку хорошие кофейни (мы были в Merlyn - находится в том же доме)."},{"_id":"247679504","date":{"$date":"2018-03-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"940374","reviewer_id":"40341858","reviewer_name":"Mehdi","comments":"Tres beau séjour dans un des plus beau quartier de Barcelone juste à côté du Glories avec tout les centre d'achat et supermarché carrefour, l'appartement est tout équipé avec un jacouzi en prime je le recommande fortement et c'est sur qu'on reviendra si on repasse à Barcelone"},{"_id":"249536839","date":{"$date":"2018-04-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"940374","reviewer_id":"59126476","reviewer_name":"Yulia","comments":"The apartment is really cosy, neat, well-equipped and suitable for a short city stay for a couple or a small family with a couple of kids.

The subway was a short walk and quickly takes you around the city. With Francesco’s advice, we purchased a T10 ticket and used the one card for the 2 of us which made traveling easy and economical.  We walked to Sagrada Familia and Park Guell (the park was a bit of a hike, but doable.)\nThe bed at the condo was probably the most comfortable we’ve ever slept in. I have back issues, so that says a lot.  As we’ve found everywhere we’ve stayed so far in Spain, there is construction noise.  It didn’t bother us as it was during the day when we were out, but if you like to sleep later in the morning, some earplugs would be helpful. \nFrancesco was a great host. I received an immediate reply to my text saying we were at the airport and leaving for the condo. When we unfortunately left my husbands cell phone in the taxi he did everything he could to help us locate it. We felt very supported while we were in Barcelona since he responded to texts immediately.

You'll hear the chirp of tropical birds in the background and wonder if he added them.  NOPE!  You'll hear this blissful sound when you sit on the peaceful porch and look out over the Pacific Ocean.

First off, the photos, while beautiful, don't really do the room justice.  It is a beautiful space.  The hosts have thought of everything for your stay.  There are dishes for your use, silverware, ironing board, beach towels, even a noodle to keep you afloat when swimming!  There are more amenities to mention but not enough characters allowed in the review.  :)  Everything was clean and bright.  The bathroom was stocked with large, thick towels and there's even a soap/shampoo dispenser on the wall.

Thomas was the perfect host and his place is exactly as pictured on Airbnb.  I'm a bit of a germ-a-phobe, even when staying in nice hotels, but Hale Kale was truly immaculate. The hosts really took great care to think of anything a guest would need while staying on the Big Island.  The kitchen was stocked with coffee, tea, a blender, a toaster oven, a microwave, an electric kettle, a small vacuum and a small fridge.  The closet provided us with plenty of room to hang our belongings and store our luggage in an organized fashion.  The murphy bed was very comfortable, we slept like babies throughout our entire stay there.  Next to the bed was a small desk containing very helpful guidebooks and a list of recommendations from the host himself.  The bathroom was fully stocked with anything you might need, including plenty of towels, shampoo and conditioner, sunblock and disposable razors.  What really stood out was the lanai with an incredible view of the ocean.  It was such a treat to wake up to every morning.  It was especially helpful that beach chairs, a beach umbrella, a boogie board and water noodles were there for us to use, saving us money and making our beach time even more relaxing and worry-free (if that's even possible in Hawaii.)  There is no A/C but the ceiling fans, a small table fan and the breeze from outside kept us cool.  We had the opportunity to meet our hosts briefly.  They were very welcoming and friendly and were very quick to respond to any email communication.  Staying here was like a dream. =)"},{"_id":"19720268","date":{"$date":"2014-09-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"941361","reviewer_id":"13528464","reviewer_name":"Mascha \u0026 Marcel","comments":"Aloha Thomas und Simone,\r\nwir haben uns sehr wohl bei euch gefühlt.

Like most rental spaces in Kona, there is no air conditioning, but there were fans, etc, and with the windows open, a lovely breeze that made for a nice stay. Thomas was expertly communicative - he provided videos and emails beforehand that detailed arrival logistics, and he also provided a folder with hand-selected local recommendations for food and activities, including running and swimming routes, which my Ironman husband greatly appreciated :) We truly felt like we were being welcomed into someone's home. Location is excellent; just a few miles from the busy Ali'i Drive where many shops and restaurants are, and only a few blocks away from a darling family-run coffee estate that offered lovely private tours (Kona Blue Sky Coffee). Communication was swift, clear, and friendly, and even though he and his family were on the mainland during our stay, we felt that we could have reached out with any issues. We would whole-heartedly recommend Thomas's apartment, and we were very sad indeed when we had to leave! Until next time! Maholo!

HIGHLY recommend staying in this adorable space."},{"_id":"109154288","date":{"$date":"2016-10-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"941361","reviewer_id":"71209075","reviewer_name":"재상","comments":"Good for comfort rest it is!\nThe place was spacious with big size bathroom.

The studio was spacious, clean, and had a ton of great amenities-- a full kitchen, a beautiful ocean view from the lanai, a really nice shower, and more. There were also lots of small extras that we didn't know we needed until we got there, like a binder full of restaurant recommendations, ponchos (which saved our butts big time), and all the beach gear you could ever need. Thomas puts a lot of time into making sure guests have everything they need for a fun and comfortable stay, and his going above and beyond made our trip that much more memorable.\n\nThe neighborhood was nice and quiet and close to all the shops, restaurants, and attractions in Kailua-Kona. My husband and I rented a car and drove to multiple spots on the island, but Kailua-Kona was definitely the best area to stay in. By the end of the week it was starting to feel like home. We were so sad to leave!\n\nWe very highly recommend Thomas' place for anyone vacationing on the island of Hawaii-- it'll be your best AirBnb experience yet."},{"_id":"122200239","date":{"$date":"2016-12-21T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"941361","reviewer_id":"52925870","reviewer_name":"Mike","comments":"This was a great place to stay in Kona.

Die Kontaktaufnahme und die Klärung der Einzelheiten im Vorfeld hat auf Englisch sehr gut geklappt. Wir haben wie vereinbart vom Flughafen angerufen und haben anschl. die Wohnung sehr pünktlich und sauber übernommen. \nDie Wohnung war größenmäßig vollkommen ausreichend für zwei Personen, da können auch 4 Personen übernachten (1x Doppelbett und 1 ausziehbare Couch). Die Wohnung war sauber, sehr gut ausgestattet (Mikrowelle, Waschmaschine, Küche mit Geschirr, Handtücher und saubere Bettwäsche). Dusche und WC sind vorhanden.\nDie Strasse unmittelbar davor ist gut befahren, wir haben aber mit geschlossenen Fenstern kaum was gehört (nur ein Mal war ein sehr lauter Motorradfahrer zu hören). \nBeim Sonnenaufgang scheint die Sonne direkt rein, was einem richtig gute Laune bereitet. Man kann zur Not auch draußen auf dem (schmalen) Balkon frühstücken. Zum Abend hin wurde die Wohnung immer kühler, was aber daran lag, dass wir die Heizung nicht eingeschaltet haben. Also, nicht vergessen, Klima einschalten.\nDie Lage war für uns ideal, wir hatten Drei-Tageskarten, wir haben aber viel zu Fuß unternommen. Sagrada Familia ist ein paar Minuten entfernt, nach unten zum Arc de Triomf sind es ca. 20 Minuten zu Fuß, Richtung Via Laietana oder La Rambla auch in etwa so weit. U-Bahnstationen und Bushaltestellen sind auch in ein paar Minuten zu erreichen.\nAlles in allem eine super Unterkunft in der man sich auch ausruhen kann zwischen den Stress am Vormittag und den am Abend, und falls man wirklich auf die katalanische Küche verzichten will auch entsprechend kochen kann.\nWir werden beim nächsten Besuch wieder ein Wohnung dort nehmen."},{"_id":"412276929","date":{"$date":"2019-02-15T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9422452","reviewer_id":"215825234","reviewer_name":"Forough","comments":"It is almost close to public transportation and in the same time a bit noisy at nights since it is located in a rather big and crowded street.

You have to take the time to explore the streets filled with quirky shops, designer boutiques and excellent restaurants.  Especially Serdar-ı Ekrem! It may be just one street but it is home to a wide variety of funky, fancy, and down-right quirky shops and boutiques. I'm definitely not a shopping guy myself but there's no denying that it's got some quite interesting places. I'll be sure to give you a nice list of places to eat\u0026drink at when you get here, compiled from places that I enjoy going to myself. They're all located nearby, but, I wouldn't type'em here since I consider it somewhat of a secret recipe : )","notes":"There is NOT a dishwasher in the apartment : (  There isn't an elevator in the building so you'll need to climb three staircases. This is a renovated historical building so the windows are a bit heavy to lift up. I'm literally not allowed to install modern ones (not that I'd choose to do so anyway).","transit":"The apartment is conveniently located just 250 meters from Şişhane metro station which goes directly to Taksim Square, the city centre.  The distance from apartment to Taksim square is around 1 km. A single metro stop, a pleasant 20 minute walk along the historical Istiklal Street or a short ride in the nostalgic tramway are different options to get to the city center. Getting to the Old City where the Blue Mosque, Grand Bazaar, Topkapi Palace etc. are is quite easy as well - just a 10 minute walk to the Karaköy tram station and a 15 min tram ride from there. If you would like to go to the Asian side there are ferries to Kadıköy departing from Karaköy. That ferry ride is lovely by the way. All in all I can freely say that the location of this apt. (or any other in the Galata area really) can not be beaten. It's amazingly easy to get to any part of the city.","access":"The place is all yours!","interaction":"Personally, I'm not doing Airbnb for the money; I just enjoy getting to meet with new people and heaving a good time really.

Despite how unnatural it feels to try and \"describe\" a human being, especially one's own self, let's give it a shot. I'm an independent game developer, which is a fancy term for \"a human who's chosen not to earn as much money as he could be earning in order not to be told how to do things\". Having lived in almost every part of Istanbul (and therefore having seen its lowest as well as its highest) I found myself unable to move away from the Galata area and eventually settled here.\r\n\r\nAs a host, I'm doing Airbnb for the sake of meeting with new people and having an excuse for drinking more beer. Being into this sort of a thing solely for the purpose of having an extra income is, tho I respect that choice as well, just not for me. I'm more of a \"eh, let's be off with the fake pleasantries, fake smiles, fake impersonations and hit the damned pub!\" person, being much more into conversations and interactions where all sides are genuine and not parts of self-made scripts. \r\n\r\nThere's something lovely about knowing that I've helped someone enjoy their trip more. It's not always easy getting a taste of the local life in Istanbul since authentic cities such as this are also usually hyper-touristy. What's more is that the understanding of a \"local life\" will differ from one part of the city to another, it's as non homogeneous as it gets and that's why I love helping my guests around - so that they can experience how we \"the Galata area people\" live.

Many interesting and unique shops around, lots of coffee shops and restaurant options, etc. Not nearly so touristy as across in Sultanhamet: the area has a 'real' feel, and there are very few buskers. I'd highly recommend this place (and area) for a first time in Istanbul, even though of course you'll have to head over to Sultanhamet to see Topkapi and Hagia Sophia, etc.\r\n\r\nThe apartment itself is recently-renovated, all fixtures work great, nice shower. Kitchen is small but serviceable—in any case there are so many good restaurants nearby that we only cooked breakfast here—and there's a washing machine and A/C unit and heaters if you need them. It's a little bit off Istiklal street, so there is not much noise at night or in the mornings ... except for whichever neighbor it is who thought a doorbell that played the first few notes of Für Elise at high volume would be an awesome idea. Somehow this particular sound goes right through the walls, despite it otherwise being adequately soundproofed. \r\n\r\nBed is comfortable, Internet is fine, host is readily available, etc. I'd stay here again the next time I come to Istanbul, and if all the apartments are rented, I'd definitely still stay in this area."},{"_id":"69937954","date":{"$date":"2016-04-14T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9444630","reviewer_id":"2439248","reviewer_name":"Tobias","comments":"Kerem's place is excellent, in a very good location."},{"_id":"74786644","date":{"$date":"2016-05-16T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9444630","reviewer_id":"24319487","reviewer_name":"Natalia","comments":"Very nice apartment and Owner!

Location is a quiet side street, pleasantly hidden from the overly-touristy Galata Tower area, with some great local cafes and boutiques around the corner (we loved Galata Kitchen in particular). A very easy walk from Sishane Metro. Unlike many of the AirBnB offerings in this neighbourhood, this apartment does not have a balcony or terrace - instead you're paying for 1) clean, fresh design, and 2) peace and quiet."},{"_id":"271703831","date":{"$date":"2018-06-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9444630","reviewer_id":"148839167","reviewer_name":"Christian","comments":"The apartment (clean with lots of amenities) is conveniently located next to the Galata tower and its surroundings with lots of cafés and restaurant.

The apartment is small but very comfortable and well appointed (with one of the larger showers we’ve seen in Europe). We also really appreciated the ability to do laundry in the washing machine.

The place was clean and had all the amenities we needed. It is strategically located in the Beyoglu area, which is good for shopping and eating out. We particularly liked to just walk around Istiklal street. It is also not too difficult to get to the Grand Bazaar and Spice Bazaar.\n\nKerem himself was helpful with the questions we had. He did not personally meet us, but he gave us his contact number and we communicated using (Hidden by Airbnb) .\n\nBe warned that the apartment is on the fourth floor and that the stairs is narrow and steep. While Kerem's apartment itself is good, the main entrance is in a small cul de sac which was not so presentable. We used Efendi Travel for the airport transfer to the apartment and the driver took a while to find the place.\n\nI strongly advice that when it is time to leave for the airport, call the taxi or Uber at least three hours before your flight. For some reason, the driver of our first Uber request cancelled our request. Then, based on Kerem's advice, we downloaded the taxi app BiTaksi and requested for taxi to the airport. Twice, the taxis we requested ignored us. The app had a map and we could see the taxis were moving away instead of coming towards us. We suspect it is because the taxi rate was too cheap to the airport, and so they thought it was not worth it to take us. Finally we made another Uber request and this time the Uber car arrived and took us to the airport in time.\n\nAll in all, Kerem's place is very good value provided you are okay with going up the stairs."},{"_id":"341955110","date":{"$date":"2018-10-28T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9444630","reviewer_id":"215842699","reviewer_name":"Michele","comments":"Very nice flat, perfect location.

From our  initial inquiry to rent the apartment until  the time we checked out - our experience with Dan was phenomenal. This was our first AirBnB experience and were happy at how easy and smooth the trip went. The apartment is centrally located and within walking distance to amazing restaurants, time square, central Park and most tourist attractions - although in saying this there was no street noise and never felt unsafe walking back at any time of the day or night. The apartment was cleaner that most hotels and a lot of care was taken to ensure it was set up for all your needs. It was a standard apartment size for New York- as a couple it was all we needed as we were out and about most of the time and only really slept there. Dan provided information on anything you could need from Restaurants to the closest Laundromat to catching the subway, to how to plan out things we wanted to do the entire week.  He got us complimentary gym passes at a very fancy gym called Equinox. He even arranged car service to and from the airport for us.   We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would not hesitate to stay again or recommend our friends and family!"},{"_id":"69789054","date":{"$date":"2016-04-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9451492","reviewer_id":"25510150","reviewer_name":"Turgay","comments":"We had a wonderful stay at Dan's house.

It had all the amenities that one would need and in close proximity to grocery stores, bars, restaurants, Broadway, Time Square, etc. We thought we would make use of the kitchen to have breakfast every morning, but with all of the notable restaurants around, why even bother (\"we're on vacation is what we kept on saying\")? \nThank you Dan for creating a comfortable space.

We stayed in a one bedroom apartment but the couch pulled out to a full/double so it was perfect! It comes with all the essentials. It has all that a typical apartment needs (coffee maker, microwave, flat screen TV, etc.) When we walked in there was music playing and the place was immaculate. This apartment is so central to most everything and just a block from subway (which we took a lot). Lots of places to eat right around the apartment. My 27 year old daughter and I felt completely safe walking at all hours in the neighborhood and it was great to end our day at our own place. Dan was SO great in offering suggestions for places to eat and even helped us get great tickets to the Broadway Show Sunset Blvd. with Glen Close. We were SO excited and it was awesome! There is an Amish Market down the street as well as a liquor store where we bought groceries, snacks, wine, etc.. Staying here was definitely better than a hotel! You won't be disappointed! It's all legit and Dan knows the business of hospitality and how to treat his guests!

This made my transfer from the airport to the apartment incredibly easy and fuss free.\nThe apartment itself was spacious, spotless, warm and inviting. Both the bed and shower were great and the wifi was fast. It had all of the necessities plus a few additional extras to make my stay comfortable. What makes this place wonderful are the hosts. Dan and Danny really love what they do and are authentically kind people.

We used their suggested driver Mussa to transfer from different airports which was so convenient. The driver also helped me pick up the key after I forgot to bring the details :)  There is a fantastic little supermarket just around the corner with all sorts of foods and a coffee stop (Kahve) also very close.

It is rather dark. We liked the flower on the table. Although the appartement is close to Time Square, it is quite quiet. However, when it was raining, the raindrops made a lot of noise, because right next to the window of the sleeping room, there is a shaft with old plastic bottels and metal. Furthermore, it was cold in the appartement. After calling Dan, we immediately got an electrical stove.\n\nDan gave us the wrong address of the appartement. Aside from this point, the host communicated quickly. He gave us a lot of information where to go and what to do.\n\nCheck-in: Since we had not the correct address, we had to walk several blocks with the bags. Dan fixed up everything and walked with us to the wright address.\n\nIn our opinion, the appartement is rather expensive, although we have to consider that the appartement is in New York / midtown."},{"_id":"259241924","date":{"$date":"2018-04-30T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9451492","reviewer_id":"28552463","reviewer_name":"Edgar","comments":"We loved everything about Dan's place.

Great location, was super easy to find, just a few blocks from the subway. \nDan is an AMAZING host and communicated with us from the moment we booked until we checked out.  He was there to help us with suggestions, which was good for us and I’m sure if you didn’t need him like we did, he’d give you your space. But it was very nice having someone that knew the city helping us out. \nThe apt was very clean and had fresh flowers waiting for our arrival!  \nPick up \u0026 drip off of the keys was super easy and close to the apt.  Dan made it a point to come introduce himself \u0026 show us the apt; always nice to actually meet your host and for them to let you know where things are located. \nWould highly recommend booking with Dan, I wish all Airbnb hosts were this wonderful and the places were what they claim it to be, like this beautiful NYC apt was. \nIf we ever have the chance to come back to NYC we’ll be booking with Dan again!!

We had the pleasure of staying with Dan and Danny and cannot say enough about how fantastic their place is, and how they have nailed it as superb hosts!!! The apartment is super clean, stylish and has all the amenities you need! Superb location in Hells Kitchen, that puts you within exact walking, bike, subway distance to all the sites you want to see.\nWhat makes the experience extra special when staying here is that it is \"better than a hotel room\"!!!! Why??? Because you will not get service at hotel like you do with Dan and Danny. They truly love what they do and want you to \"experience\" NYC as it is meant to be seen. Like you live there, not like a tourist!. They provided us with early check in and sat down with us and gave us a wealth of tips and ways to enjoy the city. Whenever we had a question or wanted a good place to eat or know how to get somewhere they were a text away!! We took them up on all their advice and we were not disappointed!. We rode the CITIBIKES which was the easiest way to get around the city and see so much more than we would from a bus or subway. We ate at some amazing restaurants that not only had food that was delish, but service and people that were there to help make your experience great too!!! They provided us with a contact for fantastic drivers that helped to get us to and from the airport with ease. Mussa and Abdlai are such hard workers and took the time to tell us about their great city as well. All this with a cozy apartment to escape to and have the privacy of your own home with a nice nightcap and all the amenities you need!!\nThank you so much, we cannot wait to come back!!!"},{"_id":"279102071","date":{"$date":"2018-06-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9451492","reviewer_id":"13838880","reviewer_name":"Colette","comments":"Dan and Danny think of all the details: super clean, soft crisp white sheets, hair dryer, excellent local tips, everything!"},{"_id":"286136087","date":{"$date":"2018-07-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9451492","reviewer_id":"59390735","reviewer_name":"Cindy","comments":"The place was super clean, everything we needed was there and Dan was there (via text) to help with anything and everything!

First, his place is clean, tasteful and, for Manhattan, somewhat easy to move about in (the bedroom is a bit tight, but very cozy). It's also extremely well located, within walking distance of Times Square, Rockefeller Plaza, Central Park and even Trump Plaza (if that's your thing, not mine), plus a subway station is a block-and-a-half away. But second, and this is perhaps more important, Dan is a gracious, thoughtful host, with pages of suggestions on where to eat (all delicious, though we didn't always sit at the bar, Dan), when and what to experience, what not to do, and generally how to navigate the Big Apple (and beyond). We can't wait to make another trip to New York. We just hope we haven't made Dan's place more popular than it already is (for our own selfish means)."},{"_id":"338460689","date":{"$date":"2018-10-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9451492","reviewer_id":"76624817","reviewer_name":"Megan","comments":"This is the second time we’ve stayed at Dan + Danny’s place.

The A/c was a blessing as it gets quite warm in summer.\n\nAdam is very quick at communication and always answered the phone when I called him or messaged him.  He gave us a very good restaurant recommendation for our anniversary dinner 'Rayan'  which specialises in seafood, has very fresh stuff and is decently priced.\n\nOur check in and checkout was seamless and we had absolutely no problem finding the nearest supermarket, tourist sites, easily accessible public transport, close to old Montreal and downtown.  Very close to St. Joseph's oratory.  Safe neighbourhood at all times of the day.  \n\nAdam is an extremely good host, I would recommend his place anytime to anyone without hesitation.  \n\nThank you Adam for letting us reserve your place.  We hope to book it again when we next visit Montreal.  \nKind regards, \n"},{"_id":"298566938","date":{"$date":"2018-07-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9473275","reviewer_id":"203392206","reviewer_name":"Anne Julie","comments":"Très propre.

Le lendemain matin j'ai vraiment apprécié le secteur, le choix était là pour les cafés et j'ai finalement pris le temps d'aller découvrir le coloré Marché Jean-Talon à quelques coins de rues de l'appartement de Xavier.

We always use hotels and serviced apartments for our holiday trips. The apartment itself is well renovated and the location is great, however there are a couple of misses that we'd like to point out in this review. COMMUNICATION: During our last night, we sent a message to Matthew and asked permission if we can check out at around 12-1pm as we are sending our family to the airport. He replied that we are only allowed to leave our bags in the apartment until 2pm because they need to clean the house. At 9 AM before going to the airport, we neatly placed our belongings including our souvenirs in the living room next to the TV. At 10:19 AM I even gave Matthew a call that we are on our way back to the house from the airport and we will be arriving back before 12 noon. We returned to the apartment on time to pick our belongings. We were in shock to find out that the cleaner/co-host Chris THREW AWAY our souvenir bag in the rubbish bin outside the house!!! The souvenirs are two fragile wax model of our hands from Madame Tussauds which we had made for our 6th wedding anniversary!!! It was kept nicely in a box and a Madame Tussauds souvenir tote bag. We could not comprehend how Chris could mistook it for rubbish! To make it worse, it was raining during that day and the rubbish bin was wet and dirty. This Chris kept making excuses and blamed Matthew that he wasn't informed that we will leave our belongings. However even if he was not informed by Matthew, he still has NO RIGHT to touch the guests' belongings and more so throw it to the rubbish bin. Clearly, communication was not the only issue here but also the lack of common sense. CLEANLINESS: 1.) The basement bedroom has a strong musty odour on the day of arrival and smells like sewage everytime we go back to the apartment after spending the day on tour. They only have a Glen 20 spray which did not mask the odour. 2.) On day of arrival, there is a lock of hair (possibly from the previous guests) in the kitchen trash bin. There are also left over drinks (soft drinks and juices) inside the fridge. 3.) Upon arrival, we strictly followed the No Shoes policy in the house straight away. However, as Matthew was touring us inside...he had his shoes ON while walking around the house which made the floor dirty. 4.) Dusty tables beside the bed and underneath the TV in the basement bedroom. 5.) My brother saw cockroaches in the Attic bedroom on two occasions. 6.) The sheets on the first floor bedroom smelled nice, however, the sheets on the Attic bedroom smelled musty...."},{"_id":"210503159","date":{"$date":"2017-11-09T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9516607","reviewer_id":"131981365","reviewer_name":"Jamie","comments":"Great area and a very cool place!"},{"_id":"211711154","date":{"$date":"2017-11-14T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9516607","reviewer_id":"32196809","reviewer_name":"Nichola","comments":"Great place for a group - six of us fit very comfortably.

Check-in was a breeze, as we were met by Matthew despite having a late arrival. He showed us where everything was located, and was friendly and welcoming.\n\nInside, the apartment is filled with amenities and welcoming touches that made us feel right at home. It's very clean and well-decorated. \n\nWe would agree with other reviewers that said the stairs are a bit steep and narrow. It was absolutely no problem for us to navigate, but I would not recommend it for the elderly or those with disabilities, as there are no bedrooms on the entry floor.\n\nOverall, 5-star place that we would absolutely choose again."},{"_id":"236685401","date":{"$date":"2018-02-19T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9516607","reviewer_id":"154144067","reviewer_name":"Zhanxi","comments":"房子非常干净,设施也很齐全｡位置很好,去市区所有的景点都在步行氛围内｡周围吃饭的选择很多,绝对是在悉尼停留的好去处"},{"_id":"237974132","date":{"$date":"2018-02-24T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9516607","reviewer_id":"107490700","reviewer_name":"Ting","comments":"Great location.

Stayed over a weekend and due to the fact the terrace is close to the street and a stones throw to Oxford st you do get noise.

It was very clean and Philip was very attentive and explained everything for us in person which was a nice touch. The downstairs \"wine cellar\" was a bit scary at first, but it made things interesting. The second bedroom was perfect in the sense that it had a good mix of a specious bedroom and best bathroom of the house. The top floor bedroom's bathroom was very tight and the downstairs bathroom seemed to get soaked everywhere when you showered. Overall, it was a very neat place to stay. It was a lot of fun to hang out at the house. Somewhere you can feel relaxed and really feel \"at home.\""},{"_id":"344533421","date":{"$date":"2018-11-03T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9516607","reviewer_id":"29657959","reviewer_name":"美榮","comments":"Great location, we were able to walk to the city such as the harbour bridge, the Sydney opera house etc…. The home was clean and had all the amenities you may need. The space is just enough for the 6 of us, although the stairs going up and down are little tight, but we love the character of this house. Parking spot is a bonus, since it is impossible to find parking around the city. Great communication with Philip, our flight was cancelled and scheduled 3 hours later than expected, Philip was very accommodating with our check in time. Philip provided us with a quick tour of his place, oriented us to his neighbourhood, and recommended restaurants to check our while in Sydney.

However, there are quirks that may mean it is not suitable for every group. For 2-3* couples it is a nice stay, and groups of friends should consider the review before they make up their mind.\n\nThe use of space is stunning and creative, so, as long as the below is ok for you – I would definitely recommend the place.   A little more detail in the description would help match expectations. For example, the top bedroom size is better for a close couple or one single - as it is very small and you can look straight at the toilet, which also has no door. The downstairs bedroom is also more suited to couples, given there is no toilet door on its ensuite either. There doesn't appear to be any extra space to adequately fit the spare mattresses offered, so we would recommend no more than five guests or three couples (if the third couple can squeeze into the top level).  Aircon was not available in the downstairs bedroom. There was no hanging space in the middle-floor room as the cupboard was locked. The stairs are very narrow and need to be navigated slowly \u0026 with feet sideways to avoid falls. We had a small hiccup getting access to the carpark at check-in, which I assume was a one-off."},{"_id":"407650887","date":{"$date":"2019-02-02T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9516607","reviewer_id":"215527536","reviewer_name":"Christina","comments":"非常好的房东 在门口迎接我们 介绍了房子的所有功能 用品 房子简直就是一个小别墅 一层厨房 二三层 地下一层各有一个房间和一个卫生间"},{"_id":"409129581","date":{"$date":"2019-02-06T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9516607","reviewer_id":"73719813","reviewer_name":"思瀚","comments":"位置很棒｡厨房设施齐全｡房东非常好,给我们很多建议和帮助｡由于晚上的飞机,还主动帮我们寄存行李,非常贴心的体验｡感谢~"},{"_id":"412144528","date":{"$date":"2019-02-14T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9516607","reviewer_id":"67504262","reviewer_name":"Lora","comments":"Phillip’s place is beautiful and in the perfect location.

The Dolphin Room was exactly as pictured, and was perfect for the two of us. The grounds of the retreat are really amazing—we spent two of our four days just hiking and exploring the grounds. We loved taking the trail down to the private waterfall and natural pool (which empties via a 100+ foot waterfall!), and hiking the breathtaking trail down to the coastline. We actually hiked up the stream to the bottom of the tall waterfall, which had a beautiful, secluded pool at its base. These were absolute highlights of our trip that we'll never forget.\r\n\r\nWilliam, the Retreat's concierge, for lack of a better term, was extremely helpful and friendly.  He introduced us to everything the grounds had to offer, checked in with us periodically, and even helped safeguard some items we left behind after our stay.  We never met Kutira; but her husband, Raphael, was a ubiquitous presence on the grounds, always doing some job or another in the proud upkeep of his home, and genuinely concerned with the well-being of his guests.\r\n\r\nThe retreat's approach to green living also had a clear impact on our experience.  It may sound silly, but when you're instructed to conserve water and electricity, or to save food compost for the chickens, you begin to realize how much you typically waste, and you begin to take pleasure in conservation. Even four days of living under these constraints have changed my behavior in ways that I hope will become permanent.\r\n\r\nOther highlights: the outdoor shower, the sizable kitchen with separate and labeled shelves and fridge space for each guest, the numerous spots to sit and enjoy breakfast, the charming hand-drawn map of the grounds.

Their considerable efforts to live in harmony with the environment will forever separate them from their much larger corporate competitors. If you prefer sterile, air conditioned comfort over sleeping with fragrant night breezes under breathtaking starlight vistas, this resort is not for you. If 20-minute hot showers and all-you-can-eat buffets are your idea of a perfect vacation, you're not likely to appreciate this deliberately minimalist eco-resort. But, if descending a challenging rope trail to a pristine rocky coastline or swimming in a spring-fed pool perched atop a 150-foot waterfall appeals to your inner child, you may have found what you're searching for. This rare, return-to-nature experience is literally and figuratively \"off the beaten path.\" I highly recommend you consider this lovely piece of old-Maui paradise."},{"_id":"28661374","date":{"$date":"2015-03-28T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"951837","reviewer_id":"28470129","reviewer_name":"Nate","comments":"I had a wonderful stay here while traveling for work, it was a relaxing place to kick back and let the mind go.

If you're thinking about staying here, do it.\r\n\r\n1) It's impeccably clean. Like eat-off-the-floors clean. That's rare on the mainland, much less way out in the jungle. \r\n\r\n2) The property is stunningly beautiful, with mature trees, landscaping that's sympathetic to the environment and neat architecture. \r\n\r\n3) It captures the beauty and feel of Maui's jungle side, without being as remote or hard-to-reach as Hana. And there's no properties like this out in Hana, at all. \r\n\r\n4) Fun/pretty hiking trails throughout the property and in the surrounding area. You could spend a few days just exploring and hanging out on the property's waterfalls, swimming holes and ocean access. \r\n\r\n5) There's good snorkeling, spearfishing and ocean swimming. You'll want to go to Little Beach in Wailea or Hana Bay for the whole reef thing, but there's neat rocks and plenty of life under the water right here.

The place is nestled on a mountain top, accessible only via dirt road through a lush tropical jungle. The experience itself of finding the property and exploring the grounds, trails, and various meditation spaces on the property was quite special. The house had lovingly curated artworks from the East. There was a house that was imported from Indonesia on the hilltop and a music/meditation room that was also nice. From this perspective, I felt like I've been granted access to all the things that Raphel and Kutira have cultivated and treasured throughout their lives and I'm very grateful to have experienced it. While we hiked and explored the grounds, a friendly parrot, stopped by and followed us from tree to tree and we loved the two dogs, Dawa and Mochi. The trail through the lagoon and waterfall was breathtaking and one of the highlights of our trip. We met a few of the other guests who were all easy to talk to and gave us some insider tips on Maui. Raphael was very accommodating and helped give us insider information on the nearby town, Haiku, as well as a thorough survey of the property. He was nice and left us to ourselves most of the time. \r\n\r\nThere are some cons to this stay which include: \r\nThe Wi-Fi on the property is spotty and weak. This made it hard to travel plan since all of my research was through the internet. \r\nUnlike other AirBnb stays, this definitely veers more on the businessy side rather than the friendly home-like feel. Instead of providing coffee and minimal breakfast, they charge you cash for eggs from their chicken farm. We arrived late from our flight and they had a $65 dollar \"late arrival surcharge\". This is a bit of an unprecented practice in my years of AirBnB use. \r\nI appreciated the eco-friendliness of the place, but not having lights turned on at night on the main hallways and walkway seems a bit overbearing.

The hike to the waterfall and down to the beach were fun and adventurous, but not for the timid. This is a no frills place and expect to pay extra for any add-ons like yoga, eggs, toiletries and beach towels, which adds a little stress to the mindfulness experience.\n \nOur room (dolphin room) was clean and the pictures portrayed it accurately, including the ocean view off in the distance. However, the meditation cottage wasn't that clean. This place is essentially in the middle of nowhere, which we enjoyed.\n \nThe spirituality that you might expect doesn't really play through. You'll see it from some of the reviews and it bears mentioning, this place is not for everyone so be sure it will work for you. We had a couple staying in the room next to us and they were so dissatisfied that they left after one night. There was also a rather nasty review in the guest book in the room we were staying in about our hosts.

The owners are a bit out there, even for us, but they really are pure love people, and are a part of the island as much as it's a part of them. The farm fresh eggs from their chickens are really tasty;) but go to Nuka (owner recommendation nearby) for one of the best Japanese meals (at $50 a head with LOTS of food and drinks) you could ask for...and we live in LA/NYC.

The property is large and beautiful, but really needs care. Many of the plants need trimming and the property looks like it needs some love. For $200 a night, I had higher expectations of what the place would be like in terms of service and amenities. The dolphin room was alright, but the bed was a super uncomfortable old squeaky spring mattress. The kitchen was lovely but they do not provide any basics for cooking (salt, pepper, spices, cooking oil). You have to buy all basics yourself. They are MILITANT about using the lights and electricity. Kutira is aloof, not friendly. I said hi to her once and instead she cut me off to ask if a light was on (a motion-activated light). She also left me a voicemail on the day of our checkout telling us to vacate our room and if they couldn't get it there would there \"would be a problem\". We were in the kitchen cooking chatting with the volunteers, had removed all of our belongings so the volunteers could clean - she could have just walked over and checked but instead left a rude voicemail. Raphael is another story. He is creepy. He hit on my friend telling her she seemed \"like a really sensual person\" based on her handwriting, also asked her age and said you look great for your age. Told us he used to take Jimi Hendrix's \"leftovers\" in the 60s. It's not the 60s anymore and hitting on young girls when they're on vacation is not a relaxing environment. Paying $1000 for 4 nights means we shouldn't have to be subjected to an old creep's hormones. Most of the volunteers who work there seems disgruntled and are also not friendly. The house isn't all that clean -- the shower has mold in it. Overall, we had such high hopes for the rate and how beautiful it looked in photos, but in person it was a bit dated and unclean and the Aloha vibes were definitely off. This is the first negative review of an Airbnb in the 4 years I've been using. Sad to write but people should know if they're going to spend so much money.

I will give the most honest review that I can. My husband and I travelled with my brother and his girlfriend to Maui. We flew in from Oahu and this was going to be the first time that we shared a house and rented a private room. When booking, the pictures looked great and we were all very excited to stay in the 'jungle' in a more remote part of Maui. We checked in a bit early, at about 1, and met Raphael. We were sure to be on time for check in, because they have a \"late fee\" because they have to hire an employee to check in after hours, which turns out to be Raphael, the owner. The whole check in seemed a bit odd. We were charged a Maui tax, and they only accepted cash. We have never been charged tax in all of our stays. After we signed our papers, he showed us the house and property. It was definitely a beautiful piece of land, nicely groomed, and beautiful views of the ocean. They had a hiking trail which lead to the ocean, as well as a waterfall and lagoon nearby. We are all adventurous and were very happy to visit the waterfall/ocean. Our room on the other hand, was extremely outdated, and the bed was rock hard. We didn't get much sleep because of how uncomfortable the bed was. In addition, I found blood on the sheets near the mattress, and the bed did not have a mattress protector, which was strange considering this place is in the jungle, and bugs are everywhere. The location and ambiance was great. At night, you can hear a feint sound of the ocean hitting rocks, and the palms swaying in the wind. The only thing strange about the night was seeing Raphael roam the house at late hours. He lived in a house adjacent to ours, yet he had some of his food in the kitchen, and we would see him roaming around in a zombie-like state. It was definitely strange, and I felt a little uncomfortable. As stated above, this was our first time renting a house with other people. All 6 rooms shared the same indoor shower, which was not very sanitary at all. The kitchen/hallways were very clean though. The kitchen was well equipped, and guests had to wash/clean all of their own dishes, and be sure to clean up after themselves, which was fine with us. Overall, we would not be staying here again. We feel that we overpaid for the room that we received, but that was not the issue. The issue for us was the fact that the bed was extremely uncomfortable, and we just did not like sharing a house and shower with 6 other rooms. If you are very spiritual and enjoy a house with 6 rooms and 1 shower, then you may find this place more enjoyable. In addition, as said above, this is definitely..."},{"_id":"177765062","date":{"$date":"2017-08-03T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"951837","reviewer_id":"23503479","reviewer_name":"Stephanie","comments":"I appreciate the amount of work that's gone into making this place a true retreat!"},{"_id":"198864565","date":{"$date":"2017-09-30T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"951837","reviewer_id":"1039825","reviewer_name":"Eric","comments":"Excellent home base for exploring the road to Hana area."},{"_id":"209229424","date":{"$date":"2017-11-04T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"951837","reviewer_id":"26174753","reviewer_name":"Marius","comments":"When we just arrived,  Raphael was coming to us and guided us around the area.

A short but steep hike down a cliffside trail brings you to the ocean. No beach but lots of big rocks to sit on and contemplate. Then if you hike up the nearby stream for a bit (we weren't able to find the trail so we were jumping on rocks and wading), you arrive at the bottom of a breathtaking 150 ft waterfall. It's not a tourist location, even off the beaten track for people who stay at the retreat, and we were all alone. It was one of the most memorable activities during our whole stay!\n\nAs to the people there, Raphael and Kutira run an eco-lifestyle program that hosts a handful of volunteers. They help run the Airbnb and were nice and helpful. The only host I met was Raphael, who was pleasant and even shared some tips on meditation when I asked. Some other reviewers mentioned feeling uncomfortable with the people there. I can see how it might get unsettling with the volunteers/hosts going about the house, especially late at night, but in my experience they were harmless and just doing their own thing. Generally they have that sort of peaceful, spiritual, earth-loving vibe, which even if you're not into, make them pleasant to be around.\n\nThe biggest thing to consider about this place is probably its location on the island. You're definitely not getting a resort-style experience and it feels like you're retreating into a secret jungle paradise after a day of Maui adventures. To get there from Paia, the nearest town, it's a 20 minute drive on a curvy (but easy) highway then a strip of dirt road. For the dirt road, most people had Jeeps or 4WD's, but we were able to get by in a small compact rental - just be prepared for bit of a turbulent entrance/exit. Paia was also the closest beach. The more popular beaches, like the ones near Kihei, were maybe a 30-40 minute drive away. One thing we learned was that there are something like 14 microclimates on Maui. We were there at the start of March and the Airbnb was mostly cloudy and windy with a bit of rain, although still warm. It wasn't a big deal since we could just drive to Kihei and the sun would bust out and we'd get our hot dry Hawaiian beach weather. Just be prepared to be driving around a good amount to get to places!"},{"_id":"246673079","date":{"$date":"2018-03-25T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"951837","reviewer_id":"178716712","reviewer_name":"Jason","comments":"I had an amazing time at this super cool retreat.

We had such an amazing morning watching the sunrise, walking the grounds, visiting the chickens and the ocean view, admiring the different buildings and landscaping, and then returning to a breakfast from the eggs of the chickens we just visited. And that was just the first two hours! The pools at the top of the waterfall were one of the most beautiful places I’ve ever been. We did the whole road to Hana and nothing was as perfect, and we certainly had no others all to ourselves! The trail to the ocean and up to the bottom of the waterfall was an adventure! Our hosts were so nice with lots of suggestions and stories, and our fellow travelers there were fun to visit with.\n\nWhen I booked I saw all kinds of glowing reviews, and then a few that brought up the negatives. I felt compelled to reply but could not, but I can here! :)\n\n1) Yes, the road is a little rough and it takes a few extra minutes. I highly recommend slowing down and enjoying the chickens (we noticed one with four little chicks on the side), the beautiful trees, flowers, etc. \n\n2) Yes, once the sunset is over the mosquitos did appear. There are fewer when the trade winds blow but the hurricane disrupted them. So, if it’s not windy, retire inside and close the screens.\n\n3) The trail to the upper pools above the waterfall is a bit steep but secured with ropes to hold on to. That said, you should bring some level of fitness and agility. And “feel your feet” :)\n\n4) The trail to the ocean is an adventure that is well worth it but take it seriously, bring water and pay attention to your route and the way back. The first bit is the scariest so that’s a good litmus test. \n\nAll in all, highly recommended!"},{"_id":"338919965","date":{"$date":"2018-10-20T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"951837","reviewer_id":"56084858","reviewer_name":"Christophe","comments":"Wonderful and peaceful place."},{"_id":"350644522","date":{"$date":"2018-11-19T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"951837","reviewer_id":"26548521","reviewer_name":"Emily","comments":"We loved spending the last 5 days of our honeymoon here! The property is absolutely amazing. There are so many small details all over the property and the house we stayed in, you just have to soak it all in! We loved the ocean trail/water fall hikes. If you are a little older or have injuries I would not suggest it. I slipped a few times but it was worth it :) \n\nThe location is about 15-20 drive from Paia but we enjoyed being a little more remote. Grab some groceries on your way (especially breakfast food). We enjoyed making our own breakfast then being out and about all day. \n\nThanks for the great stay and probably one of the more unique Airbnbs I’ve ever stayed in. It’s not for everyone but it was exactly what we wanted!"},{"_id":"403862878","date":{"$date":"2019-01-21T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"951837","reviewer_id":"100699547","reviewer_name":"Lauren","comments":"Such a great experience and a beautiful place with breath taking views!

Julian was an incredibly gracious host.  He took time to give us a tour of his apartment and gave recommendations on what sites to see (including providing directions on a map, with alternate routes).  His apartment is literally a 10 minute walk from the Sagrada Familia and two short metro stops from the center of the city.  Furthemore, there is a grocery store just around the corner of his house (buy your water here rather than at the tourist shops near the Sagrada Familia).  If you buy tickets to tour the Sagrada Familia and need to pick up your tickets from a Caixa ATM, there is one just across the street from his apartment.  The location of the flat cannot be beat! \r\n\r\nMy mom and I were in Barcelona only for 1 day, since we were leaving for a cruise the following morning.  Julian provided directions on how to take public transportation to the cruise terminals, which was incredibly easy (you just need to take 1 bus, the #20, which departs from across the street from Julian's flat, and then transfer to the cruise shuttle buses, the T3).  We were very impressed by how gracious Julian was and how much he did to accommodate us.\r\n\r\nThe apartment and the room itself are very clean.  Julian provided us with two towels apiece, snacks, and cold water upon our arrival.  The bathroom is also extremely clean.\r\n\r\nI HIGHLY recommend staying at Julian's place.  Meeting Julian was genuinely one of the highlights of our trip!  If I ever return to Barcelona, I will definitely stay with Julian again.

We wanted to take a break before to have fun in Barcelona. The next morning at breakfast, Julian looked up from his breakfast just to tell us that it was not normal to take a break in the afternoon, he said that it was not \"safe\" for him. he wanted to know what we have done in Barcelona. He was nervous, unpleasant, the situation was a little surrealist.\r\n\r\nSarah  "},{"_id":"9958775","date":{"$date":"2014-01-21T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"95560","reviewer_id":"10971957","reviewer_name":"Tom","comments":"A very good choice.

Regarding Julian, he was always available to answer any questions, gave us advice about transports that was very important for us to save money and recommended some places to visit.

First of all he did not welcome me and my girlfriend friendly. The first thing that he told us were some house rules written down on a paper. He told us not to take too long showers maximum of 10 minutes before anything else. At this point we thought that he is a little bit fuddy-duddy but it became worse. In the first night we came home at 1 AM and 7 AM very quiet to change our clothes at our room for 10 minutes and left the apartment again. In this morning we had a message written on a piece of paper glued at the door: ''I need to talk to you 8 AM''. I felt like I would be Juliàns' little child who has to be there at 8 AM. Of course we did not meet him at 8 AM but at about 10 AM we went back to his apartment and he catched us infront of the room. He told us that this is maybe not the right apartment for us and that we should think about changing our apartment. It would not be usual that the people come in and go out in the middle of the night. I said that I am sorry but I did not know that we are not allowed to come and go quietly when we want to. I told him that I will change the apartment when he gives me back the money for the next nights, but he refused that option. Thus, we did not leave but just tried to come to his apartment for sleeping. He has not a respectful behavior and his flat is not very clean. The neighbourhood is friendly and nice and the location is central. I would not recommend this apartment and this host."},{"_id":"14693000","date":{"$date":"2014-06-24T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"95560","reviewer_id":"8957165","reviewer_name":"Hen-Wei","comments":"He is really a nice to get in touch with.

Расположение. От метро идти минут 10, не меньше, и постоянно в горку. Если много вещей и чемоданы тяжелые, не очень комфортно. \r\n2. Квартира. В квартире сдаются 2 комнаты - эта и еще одна на одного гостя. Обстановка очень скромная, ремонта давно не было, но все очень чисто, хорошо прибрано. Нюанс - ночью слышно соседей, так как конструкция дома такова, что внутри дома - полое пространство, куда выходят вентиляционные окна из кухни. Через них слышно все. \r\n3. Комната. Очень маленькая. на фото выглядит как-то просторнее. Нюанс: в комнате есть окно, которое выходит на террасу. Находясь на террасе хозяин/другие постояльцы видят все, что происходит в комнате. Чтобы чувствовать себя в полной безопасности, окно необходимо закрывать. Если закрывать ночью - очень душно. \r\n4. Хозяин. Это самая большая проблема этой квартиры. Неприветливый, угрюмый ботаник и педант. Такое впечатление, что он просто ненавидит людей. Стращал нас правилами: мыться быстро и бесшумно, за собой все убирайте, чтобы все выглядело так, как будто вас здесь не было, не шумите, иначе с соседями будет проблема, в гости никого не водите, громко не разговаривайте, музыку не включайте. Не нравится - я могу аннулировать бронирование. И что вы улыбаетесь - я говорю что-то смешное?\r\nСам за все то время, что мы его видели, не улыбнулся ни разу. После многочисленных отличных отзывов о нем, было очень странно встретиться с таким человеком. В общем, мы подумали, что он вообще серийный маньяк-убийца. В другой комнате жила девочка из Канады, она была такого же мнения о хозяине - Хулиане.\r\nОстанавливались всего на 2 ночи, пережили. Но старались в квартире вообще не появляться, душ принимать по-минимуму, разговаривали шепотом и ходили на цыпочках. На мой взгляд, не лучший вариант в Барселоне, таком солнечном и позитивном городе.

I only left the my room to buy food, go to the bathroom, or grab food from the refrigerator.  So, I was not one of Julian's typical guests.

But there was an irreconcilable problem: Julian is not a very good or kind host. He was anal about being quiet, and once he came to my room at 3 am because I accidentally dropped my water bottle. He didn't respect me, my brother, or my girlfriend, saying it was \"weird\" that one night one stayed with me and the next the other did instead. On a different occasion, after going out for dinner and drinks with my girlfriend on her last night in Barcelona (I live in Zaragoza though she lives in the US) we came back around 1 or 2 am, which angered Julian who later accused us of being obnoxious people who just want to party even though we came in quietly, respectfully, and didn't wake the other floor mate up (we got along very well with the other airbnb guest). He said he didn't want to host visitors who wanted to enjoy the nightlife, as if it was abnormal.\r\n\r\nEssentially, his house rules sound reasonable, but the way he enforces them prove to be absurd. He at least refunded the remainder of our trip when we decided to go elsewhere where we could feel comfortable and relaxed. You, too, can find a better deal in Barcelona; In my time using airbnb, Julian stands out as an exceptionally poor host, which is confirmed by other critical reviews."},{"_id":"24350765","date":{"$date":"2014-12-26T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"95560","reviewer_id":"6826549","reviewer_name":"Paromita","comments":"Julians home in Barcelóna is an excellent choice..Its neat and very cozy..and just 5 blocks Walk from Sagradafamilia..You have métro as well as bus connections that can take you everywhere..the neighborhood is v nice and Quiet..Park Guell is Also a 20 min Walk..Julian is a very Nice and kind person..he gave me lot of good recomendations.

Just to give you an exemple, on the day that we had to do the check-out, not only us but order guests aswell, before noon, the host started to clean the bathroom at 10:30 +/- ... Not very logical in my opinion. When we asked him if we could take a quick  shower he started to rebullying something in Catalan (so we did not understand a thing) and we could tell he was upstet. In overall  conclusion, we understand that is not our house but we wanted to feel confortable at least. Even respecting all the house rules and being gone for the majority of the time still he had allways something to report.

We spent most of our stay walking on egg shells as he runs the flat with a rather draconian authority (you get the feeling he has had some poor experiences with guests in the past). The location is close to the metros and the flat is clean. But just be warned that the place feels much more than like a strict boarding school than a warm home from home.

The room's door is right in the kitchen/common area, so not as much privacy as I prefer, but overall not an issue since we were out a lot.

He was helpful in the way that we could use his land phone in order to speak with airBnB team and explain the situation.\nI think that Julian has some anger issues and he is also very strict with his rules. My friend couldn't even go to the toilet after 2 hours flight, and had to speak with Julian and airbnb team for one hour before leaving the apartment.\nAs I could see from other guests comments, Julian has a lot of experience as a host and maybe my case was unique.\nWouldn't recommend him as a host because my experience could be rated as 0 stars."},{"_id":"319001956","date":{"$date":"2018-09-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"95560","reviewer_id":"112704794","reviewer_name":"Polina","comments":"Very nice area, clear room, great communication and nice tipps for the city!"},{"_id":"319817045","date":{"$date":"2018-09-07T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"95560","reviewer_id":"80896141","reviewer_name":"Theodora","comments":"Excellent location."},{"_id":"320590503","date":{"$date":"2018-09-09T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"95560","reviewer_id":"30712031","reviewer_name":"Aleksander","comments":"Everything was fine, rules clearly explained, nice and quiet place in a very good location."},{"_id":"322848236","date":{"$date":"2018-09-14T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"95560","reviewer_id":"77632399","reviewer_name":"Inan","comments":"Great location and relaxed, quiet flat."},{"_id":"324523425","date":{"$date":"2018-09-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"95560","reviewer_id":"188564208","reviewer_name":"Marcelo","comments":"The place is very well located and he is very clean but he has so many house rules that I felt uncomfortable.

He was upset for waiting but online it said check in form 2pm to 10pm and I never got a message from him saying  that we should schedule a time. He limited the bathroom time and schedule shower hours. I have only spent a day there and honestly I’m not a party person or a noise person but I found myself rushing through my dinner in order to be home before 11 pm because he asked us not to shower after 11pm. I understand that he may want to avoid noise and disturbance but it was too much for me. I went with a friend and she wanted to dry her her and couldn’t because it was 11pm.

It is in a very safe neighborhood, we feel safe walking even in the wee hours. There is a 24-hr convenient store just in front of Ashiv's place which is very useful whenever you need something. It is really close to Subway station M and R going to Manhattan, it is just like a 2-3min walk. And also bus routes, though we never use bus in our trips. This place is very convenient, aside from it is located in Austin St, you have your own private room and your private bathroom and that's what we are looking for, most of the places I have looked were shared baths. Basic needs like soaps, shampoo, tissue, towels are provided. There were so many restaurants (Asian, Peruvian, Mexican etc), food stores, 99cents store and a mall just in Queens Ave. We just have some issues that I addressed to the host and he assured that it will be changed. Ashiv is a very nice guy, he made sure that we are ok with our stay. He went down to see us and to personally say goodbye the night before we checked out. It was an easy check in/check out and I suggest that you download the August lock before you check in. We had a good time staying at Ashiv's place and we'll still choose his place whenever we have a chance to go back to New York. Thanks Ashiv!

It was also $28 from Ashiv’s place to JFK airport. \n\nthere is a local grocery store right outside the house called Austin Farm. extremely convenient for getting snacks, fruits and bottled waters.\n\nIt felt like a safe neighborhood. There is a police station on the same street. we also saw a farmers market on a weekend morning while we were on the way to the subway station. we didn’t explore the surroundings but there are definitely some restaurants (pizza, sushi, Chinese) nearby.\n\nWe didn't check in until 11pm, the fact that we could enter the house with passcode (instead of physical key) was great. \n\nWe haven't met Ashiv in person, but he responds almost immediately every time which we really appreciate. It helps us to plan our trip smoothly. \n\nThe house is fully furnished with couch, tv, table, drawers, two big closets (hangers included), bed, stove, microwave, big trash can. petty much everything you need is there, except iron and a full size mirror. the house could use a bit cleanliness, other than that, everything is as expected.\n\nWe found the bed quite comfy, my husband and I slept very well for the three nights we were there. the house is very close to train line, the noise didn't bother us, but if you are a light sleeper it might be a problem."},{"_id":"182874446","date":{"$date":"2017-08-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9562872","reviewer_id":"135358903","reviewer_name":"Joyce","comments":"ABOUT \u0026 LOCATION: Great location in a safe and quiet neighborhood.

The place was exactly what we expected. Some noises from the train and walking upstairs occurred, but we are not light sleepers:) I bought earplugs and slept like a child. Special thanks for making the place very warm- it was necessary in December weather conditions! It was easy to take a shower and come out to a very warm room/bathroom. My favorite feature was the heated step in front of the bathroom:) I used it for drying and heating the bathroom rugs. The location is just great! 2-3 minutes walk to the subway station, and you are in Central Park in 40 minutes, for instance (straight line- “R” train). Lots of awesome restaurants around, and of course, the convenience store 30 seconds away from the house was very helpful! Overall, it was a great deal for the price. Future tenants, do not expect perfection at everything. Things happen, and we all have to realize the whole family lives upstairs. They walk, they make some sounds, but it is normal. Nevertheless, the guys are very polite, responsive and understanding.

It was such a hot period whilst we were in Sydney and the strong air conditioning unit and the stand fan in the apartment was a total life saver! However I must give a thumbs up to the location as it was walking distance to the Darling Harbour, QVB, Pitt street mall, Martin place and also just less than 10 minutes walk to Wynyard train station. Gavin allowed us to check in early and also leave our baggages after check out time which was really helpful as we would not need to carry our luggages every where we go.\n\nMy family which consist of 4 over 50 year olds has no complain whatsoever on the apartment. It's their words that \"the apartment is good.\"\n\nOverall, I must say, I would totally recommend Gavin's apartment.

It was not fixed by building management during our stays (probably due to Christmas holidays).

They all worked fine. The host even left a box of welcome chocolates which was a nice touch.\r\nWe stayed during an unusually hot week.

We left or luggage in the room and went back to collect it and used the toilet, and even though we cleaned our own towels, paid a cleaning fee and had to buy glen 20 to get the stench off the pillows and bed clothes the host charged another $20 for using the toilet.  We are all different ages ranging from 18 to 70 and none of us recommend this dirty horrible place to stay. Sydney is beautiful and we had a great time but DO NOT stay here.

The first experience was fine and Claudia and her sons were very nice.  This time it didn't turn out well because I couldn't find a parking spot at her place.  I spent at least an hour looking in the neighborhood.  I left a couple of times and came back and still couldn't find anything.  I contacted the host, and she said this never happens.  After that, I decided to go to my son's place a few miles away, but he only has a single bed. Claudia did say I could come back and try again in a driveway if it was available, but I had to leave for the airport early the next morning and didn't have time or the desire to drive back.  After a couple hours, I realized it wasn't working out at my son's, so I left at 1 am and eventually stayed the night at Laguardia airport but didn't sleep.  The next morning Claudia said her son found parking spots the night before, and she did  \"I rent rooms and not parking space.\"  Claudia would not give me a refund, but Airbnb approved one.

It feels like real community and unless you have to, you wouldn't ever have to leave--great eats, drinks, parks, late night pizza, shops, etc. The apartment itself was immaculate and beautifully furnished with simple pieces. It wasn't a very hot week, so the window AC unit was the perfect amount of cool. Bed was cozy and the kitchen had all the basics although I certainly didn't cook there. Shower/bathroom was spotless, great water pressure and again just really simple. The profile is 100% accurate. In terms of a host review, Ute was professional, easy going, and very organized.

Parking was abundant, and it's just a few blocks from some very trendy bars and restaurants. The apartment is a decent walk from public transportation, but the major subway hub in Brooklyn makes it convenient. The apartment is a loft-style apartment, up two flights of stairs. We stayed with our baby, and Ute provided a pack-and-play that was perfect for her. The kitchenette has the basics -- smaller (1/2 size) fridge, stove, hot pot for tea, French press coffee maker, etc. No dishwasher or microwave -- this isn't the place for cooking (but no need to cook in NYC). The bed was firm and comfortable, and the shower had great pressure. Everything was clean and neat.

Smith Street very close, for more great places to eat and drink. Also worth heading towards Union St station and have some Polish dumplings at Baba's Pierogies! The only tiny downside, since we agreed to pay $50 extra for a second sofa-fold-out bed to be made up, we found that wasn't done when we arrived and had to remind our host.

There are some cons that heavily affected our stay.\nPROS: Good location and close to the subway. Not the prettiest neighborhood in Brooklyn, but it's relatively safe and there are some new and interesting eateries. Comfortable bed, one of the best we've had in an airbnb. Without asking, Ute told us that we could have a late check out, allowing us to leave at 1:00pm because she didn't have any guests after us. She quickly accommodated our requests to raise or lower the heat, which she controls from her side of the building.\nCONS: When we arrived, Ute greeted us to show the apartment, and there where bags of garbage just outside the door to the unit. She threw them away right after. The apartment is on top of a mechanic garage so it was very loud during work hours (beginning at 8am), and the space quickly filled with a strong engine exhaust odor. The heater made a strong gasoline-like smell, which made sleep difficult and breathing uncomfortable. The apartment appeared clean but the second day we found a cockroach in the bathroom near the shower. Even though we didn't plan to cook, it was challenging to peel an apple because there weren't proper knives. In the kitchen both the sponge and dish towel were so dirty we didn't feel comfortable using them to clean dishes, so we bought our own. The bathroom towels were probably clean but very old and the lighter ones had dark stains. We also found stains on the bed sheets."},{"_id":"228414835","date":{"$date":"2018-01-19T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9578325","reviewer_id":"5326135","reviewer_name":"Naomi","comments":"It was a pleasure staying at Ute’s apartment.

There’s a reason this place has such good reviews. We stayed six nights at Ute’s and were really happy with our choice; check-in and communication with Ute was very easy, there was an A/C unit when needed, a serviceable kitchen, a good bathroom, comfortable and large bed, and good available storage space. The neighbourhood is really up and coming with great bars, cafes, shops, and restaurants in the area, and we liked that it was close to the R. There’s a Whole Foods close by (and an Associated Supermarket when you’re feeling less rich), a gym by Union St, and we also liked that Prospect Park was within jogging distance.

Between Haleiwa, the Dole plantation, Sunset Beach, Waimea Bay, etc. there was a lot to explore in the immediate area.

Why? Let me explain.\r\n\r\nFirst the property is quiet. I mean pin-drop quiet. Located just a short drive up a country road from the Food Land near Pupukea Beach (pro-tip: the ahi poke is marvelous), the loudest thing you’ll hear is the chirping of tropical birds (and maybe a rooster) early in the morning. At night you’ll see stars so vivid you’ll swear you’re in a planetarium. (Pro tip #2: bring a small flashlight - the country roads tend to be sparsely lit.) It’s only about a 7-minute drive down to the beach for some of the finest food, surf, and sand anywhere on the planet. \r\n\r\nSecond, Love is one of the coolest, friendliest, and most mellow hosts we’ve ever encountered. A professional surfer/stuntman/fight coordinator (yes, people this cool actually exist) he went out of his way to make us feel like old friends. When the water heater broke during our stay did he toss up his hands and say, “I dunno what to do. Maybe shower at the beach?” Heck no, techno! He offered us the shower in the nearby pool house while ensuring the water heater in our unit was repaired quickly. \r\n\r\nLook, I’ve been to Oahu like a million times. If you’re mulling the merits of staying somewhere with a little more action - like say downtown Honolulu – don’t do it. It’s like sleeping in a hot metal garbage can while someone bangs on the outside with a hammer. Staying at Amy and Love’s place, on the other hand, is like getting a deep tissue Shiatsu massage while being spoon fed macadamia nut ice cream. \r\n\r\nDuring your stay you’ll find yourself asking questions like “I wonder how long I can extend my vacation without losing my job?” and  “How much does property cost on the North Shore?” While everyone will answer these queries differently one thing you’ll never question, if you stay at Amy and Love’s place, is your choice of accommodation. \r\n"},{"_id":"9055746","date":{"$date":"2013-12-03T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"958849","reviewer_id":"9605888","reviewer_name":"Sabrina","comments":"We stayed in Amy \u0026 Love's studio for a week over the Thanksgiving holiday.

We woke up to the sounds of birds in the lush tropical setting where their house sits high atop a mountain. The place was immaculate and very up to date. The proximity to everything on the North Shore can not be beat. It was very private like having your own guest house. Nice and quiet surroundings. A class act to say the least. I felt like I hit the jackpot of places to stay on the North Shore. I hope to book more dates in the future with them. Can not say enough good things about my experience there.

He allowed me to check in early so I could drop off my stuff in a safe location and hit the surf. The place is in a quite neighborhood up the the hill from the only grocery store in the area, Foodland. The location was convenient for getting everywhere on the North Shore and since it is up in Pupukea it is a little cooler, which is great when sleeping at night with the windows open.

As I was jet lagged, I especially appreciated the light breakfast left for me so I didn't have to go out foraging that first groggy morning. There was great communication before and throughout the stay and the host was gracious, immediately responsive, and very accommodating. The kitchen was well stocked with essentials and I was able to immediately settle in. The apartment was actually better than the listing - the lanai is HUGE and the lanai's private garden was a relaxing, beautiful oasis. It has a great view of Diamond Head as well. The apartment itself is newly renovated and gorgeous; I was the envy of my colleagues who were staying in small studios. Instead of the typical, just tolerable hotel furniture, the apartment had quality, comfortable pieces, and the overall design was great. The colors, artwork, finishes, everything about the decor was thoughtful and pleasing. The bedding and towels were great quality. I was surprised to find that beach chairs, boogie boards, beach umbrella, beach towels, snorkel gear, etc. were provided as well. I seriously had everything I needed for a beach vacation. The apartment doesn't have its own washer and dryer, but the community laundry room was down the hall and I rarely found the machines occupied, so it wasn't a big deal. I loved the location. The building is a hotel/condo combo and only two blocks from the beach, but in a quieter part of Waikiki so it was less hectic. There is still some street noise, of course - it's an urban area - but I never closed the windows and I slept just fine. If I had closed the windows and used the AC I wouldn't have heard anything. I had a car during my stay, which I kept in the building's garage, but only needed to use it when I left Waikiki. Otherwise, everything in Waikiki is walkable. I've stayed in hotels in Waikiki before many times and this was a much better experience; I loved staying here and it was a real pleasure to come back to this apartment at the end of every day. If I ever get a chance to come back for 30+ days again, I'm definitely going to try to stay here again.

Walking distance to Manly Harbour, Manly ferry, cafes, bars and shops.\r\nInteresting and peaceful green nature reserve in front of the apartment which we walked through to access Manly harbour. Glimpses of the harbour. Not a lot of street parking, but we managed ok most of the time. Car not needed tho if you are exploring Manly and with the ferry so close! The Friday night international food markets very close by. Just a short walk over to the surf side and round to beautiful Shelly Beach.\r\nWe had everything we needed for a 2 night stay, and would recommend our hosts and their apartment."},{"_id":"213748621","date":{"$date":"2017-11-22T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9597872","reviewer_id":"145750004","reviewer_name":"Sayan","comments":"The host canceled this reservation 38 days before arrival.

He met us at the apartment and showed us on a map where to walk to get to the gallery the next day, which was extremely helpful and very kind of him. It's a nice walk into Circular Quay, Botanic Gardens and The Rocks.\n\nLast but not least, all 3 of us were in awe of the book collection in the apartment.

Our third person in our party wanted to report that the futon was one of the most comfortable she has ever slept on. David was helpful before arrival and met us on the door to walk us through the locking systems, easily mastered, of the semi-public courtyard setup of the building. Flat was comfortably and stylishly furnished and we were not lacking for any amenity. Very much recommended.

But a short block away, the neighborhood turns into a rather hip, locals-only restaurant filled area that was nice to spend time in."},{"_id":"170525055","date":{"$date":"2017-07-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9599384","reviewer_id":"31555941","reviewer_name":"Kathleen","comments":"You really can't beat the location of this apartment.\nThere's a great view of the fountain and is an easy walk to the train (subway) and because of the apartment's location, we almost only ever needed to go a couple stops.

Small kitchen, lived-in, authentic, Ulas was very generous sharing coffee and such; living area is spacious and lovely: Decorated with music posters and relics from Ulas's event-organizing days, as well as tons of books. It has an artist's pad vibe (which I loved, but might not be everyone's style). Ulas (and roommate, too) were very friendly and communication was excellent. The air circulation in the room was a little less than ideal (I stayed in the second room, with the wrought-iron bed frame) and it got quite hot and humid, but hey, it's Istanbul in the summer and overall it was fine. The cats are friendly but got a little lonely when Ulas was gone, but if you like to play with cats, you'll have a family of three to entertain. The bathroom and other aspects of the \"facilities\" are worn and gritty, but well-maintained and perfectly functional. If you're looking to live as a student or artist in Besiktas, this is a great place to stay. The best part is that it's right off the main drag, which is extremely crowded and busy, but the apartment is actually amazingly quiet for Istanbul and set back enough from the busy-ness that it feels residential and cozy without any sacrifice in convenience.

Breakfast was always fresh, well presented and tasty. All facilities were beautiful and very well maintained. Ubers and taxi's find it difficult and sometimes refuse to go there because of it being perched on at the top of a hill, but that was easily circumvented with a 1 min walk to the highly popular bar at the end of the street where taxi's very often pass. We walked a lot in the night time and never bumped into any characters, other than the odd tourist wondering around as well. Ewa is a great host with a lot of help in direction and restaurants personally approved as good."},{"_id":"204947053","date":{"$date":"2017-10-20T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9643051","reviewer_id":"153619228","reviewer_name":"Carolina","comments":"a casa é muito gostosa. o café da manhã super especial, com pão feito pela Ewa. foi tudo ótimo! adorei os mapas com dicas da cidade. muito legal!"},{"_id":"226988054","date":{"$date":"2018-01-13T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9643051","reviewer_id":"110117299","reviewer_name":"Laura","comments":"Wir hatten eine unglaublich schöne Zeit bei Ewa und können Sie einfach nur weiterempfehlen.

She is gracious and warm. She does make homemade breakfast served with peeled fruits so this is a real Air B\u0026B bed and breakfast. So delicious she even prepared a special one when I had an early trip one day. The place is glorious. Meticulous interior design loyal to original state of the house in one of Rio’s old neighborhood of Santa Teresa is so impressive. Two bathrooms makes it so easy to get a start off your day plans. Very clean. A little more elevated than expected with some effort to walk up to in the Rio heat. Also a bit far from train station but worth it to reach to and stay in such charming place with best breakfast and host who gives you a map she made with area tips. Taxi stand very nearby a convenience leaving the neighborhood of Santa Teresa and Über all over Rio easy to go back from Ipanema or Copacobana. During Carnaval there is a lot of bloco block parties on the streets: Taxis know how to avoid them but farther routes mean more metered money. Über has flat rate but would occasionally get into traffic during Carnaval and some Über drivers get surprised of the climb up to Santa Teresa. Beautiful area of all of Rio  I’m so happy to have learned about this area Santa Teresa. Safer place to walk around I think. Best souvenirs from craftsmen here Tucum (closed when I visited last day but noted my Airbnb room had a well-crafted trash can with a tag that is Tucum) and La Verada. Views of the city from Park of Ruins 12 minutes walk. I would come back here for the neighborhood charm, beautiful house, clean bathrooms, talented intelligent host and quietness the most important for me."},{"_id":"240273869","date":{"$date":"2018-03-04T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9643051","reviewer_id":"16362983","reviewer_name":"Nicola","comments":"Ewa was a super nice host. \nCommunication was fast and easy. \nThe breakfast was wonderful."},{"_id":"249712131","date":{"$date":"2018-04-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9643051","reviewer_id":"16806704","reviewer_name":"Andre","comments":"Ewa und Davi sind großartige Gastgeber und ich hatte eine tolle Zeit dort.

He gave us the walk through and thoroughly explained everything to us (where everything was, don't leave without the keys, how to use the washer and dryer, etc.).  The place was updated well for our requirements.  The one great thing was the air conditioner.  It really cranked out the air in each room and the living room.  In like 5 minutes you either needed a blanket or to turn it off/down.  It has a lot of room and everything you need in the kitchen, plus there's a grocery store literally at the front of the building.  When you have the doors open, the street can be noisy in the living room, but you have a huge balcony to people watch and you're in Barcelona which is never quiet.  Think NY, or Miami.  The location is very central, about a 5 minute walk to the Ramblas.  Barcelona is very spread out so it's not close to everything, but the subway is easy to use, cheap and a block away.  There are a bunch of cafes and other restaurants/stores right downstairs as it's on the main thoroughfare of Gran Via.  We couldn't have been happier.  One negative that is really unavoidable in an old city like this the elevator.  It can fit one person and maybe two pieces of luggage comfortable, so you need to make a few trips up to the 3rd floor.  But it is a beautiful piece of history in and of itself and is fully functional.  A warning would be that if you're planning on throwing a raucous party don't stay here.  The building has strict rules as it is residential.  If the police come, you're out on the street and your security deposit is gone.  We just needed a place to stay.  All the partying is done out in the city!  Great place to relax and kick back before and after sightseeing, dinner, or whatever.  Highly recommend.  Great location, great host, great town!"},{"_id":"38477045","date":{"$date":"2015-07-16T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"967346","reviewer_id":"27245698","reviewer_name":"Cameron","comments":"Tout s'est fait naturellement avec Sam, lorsque nous avons découvert l'appartement il était exactement comme sur les photos (il n'y a pas de photoshop derrière).

There's a subway just around the corner, which makes public transport easy. Easy lockbox check-in, which meant no waiting around for your AirBnB host to arrive, this was really appreciated. the apartment was nice, the bed was super comfy and the curtain blacked out most of the light when closed, so we could sleep in without having sunlight waking us up. The fridge, stove and all the amenities worked well. The shower worked well and had plenty of hot water, although we didnt need it because it was so hot during the week outside. The air-con is an evaporative unit, so whilst it kept the room at a comfortable temp, it was quite noisy (but it's a constant noise, so you can still sleep alright). There's a CVS Pharmacy 2 blocks up the road with a small grocery store attached to it, which made it a very handy spot for late night alcohol purchasing and snacks. Qiyao is a great host, she gives you a guide once you book, which makes staying at the AirBnB super easy.

There was a huge air conditioner unit taking up space, which had its pipe installed in a piece of cardboard holding the window open, so there was a draft and a fair bit of a noise coming in.

She also provided us with a guide that was quite helpful. It included details about our stay as well as her personal favorites of where to eat and things to see. \nI don’t want to be too harsh here but I would not describe Qiyao’s place as “stylish”. It’s  pretty sparse and she needs to improve some of the amenities and provisions in her apartment that would make anyone’s stay more enjoyable and feel like it was a good value. I don’t think I’m being too picky here but I’m not an NYU student. (Mom with a teen-age daughter). Bed and bath linens need replacing to start, as well as some basic kitchen amenities (microwave, toaster, basic coffee maker, cutting board). \nThe bathroom has a cracked sink, broken floor tile and the tub needs to be re-caulked (moldy). \nThe bedroom ceiling has a hole that looks like it was caused by water damage and ran down the wall and it was just painted over. There’s one curtain panel over the window, not 2 and the clock is broken (has one hand). The pillows and bed linens are old, the towels are also old and stained and there’s no bath mat for the slippery tile floor. There was once a smoke detector in the kitchen by its been removed. \nThe neighborhood is great and is in close proximity to Washington Square, many great shops and restaurants and easy walking distance to a few subway stations. \nWe’ll see if my review makes it  for public viewing.

On Saturday visit Glebe Markets on the grounds of Glebe Public School.  'The Glebe' was given to the church by the Governour in the first few years of European settlement as a means for the church to support itself.  Most of the suburb was sub-dived and built upon in the 1880's and the vast majority of the terraces you'll see today were built in that era. Workers unions and left wing politicians managed to fend off building developers in the 1970's resulting in charming terraced townhouses and cottages surviving so close the the city skyscrapers.","notes":"*The house can accommodate up to 5 adults and two babies.

It's so easy to access all the amazing sites and there's tons to do right outside the front door. Bryan was great with quick responses and provided so many helpful extras that you would never get at a generic hotel. Highly recommend the French toast with bacon and bananas at Esca and all the other cafes on Glebe Point Road. We had everything we could have needed for a couple with a toddler.

If you want to have another amazing view, you just need to go the cottage’s balcony and enjoy the sundown with a glass of good wine. \n\nWe had an amazing time while we visited Sydney.

Besonders das Deck mit Blick auf die Anzac Bridge und das Wasser hat uns gut gefallen, frühstücken dort oder ein Glas Wein nach der Stadtbesichtigung trinken. Die Anbindung per Bus war unproblematisch, der Fußweg zum Jubilee Park (unbedingt den neuen Tramshed mit vielen tollen Läden und Restaurants besuchen!) und zum Darling Harbour herrlich am Wasser entlang und leicht zu finden. Kleines Minus: wir waren zu zweit und es hat uns gut gefallen, mit mehr Leuten könnte es etwas eng werden.

Bryan is an amazing host. From the first moment we booked he was super responsive, gave lots of tips, filled the fridge with some stuff for us, and even gave us stroller to use for the little one and some games for the childrens. The place is well equipment with everything you need in the living room, in the kitchen and in the showers. Everything was clean when we got there, and also was clean towels and clean sheets waited for each of us. Also the place is in excellent location: super quite neighborhood, 5 minutes from bus station, 7 minutes from the train station, and 22 minutes to the center (harbor). You can't ask more then that... Super great location for anyone including families. I have been in many AirBnB apartments in different countries, and hosting like Bryan gave I never saw.... I highly recommend to anyone traveling to Sydney to stay at Bryan's place - better the  hotel."},{"_id":"272717960","date":{"$date":"2018-06-04T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"9701620","reviewer_id":"27713278","reviewer_name":"Cameron","comments":"Bryan was very helpful and eager to please.

We didn't cook while we were there as there were plenty of restaurants and cafes on Glebe point road just 5 minute walk around the corner.
