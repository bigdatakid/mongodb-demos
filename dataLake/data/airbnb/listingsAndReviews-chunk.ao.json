Mary and Glenn have created \"home away from home\" for a tired traveler. Not only that the place is sparkling clean, having a comfort level of the highest rated hotels, king-size bed I only wish I had at home, kitchenette with everything you need even if you decide to move-in full time, bathroom with everything \"in case you forgot\" and much, much more. Touches like cold water and juices in the fridge, as well as your coffee cream and butter, Keurig coffee maker with the best coffees to choose from, fresh Kona coffee with the grinder for the freshest flavour, chocolate candies for the sweet tooth attack, varieties of teas to choose from, honey and any other sweetener to choose from for the picky ones are there, as well as the assortment of DVDs, books, cards, maps, beach towel, instructions for the places to see and things to taste and then there are your kindest of the kind hosts and their puppies they saved from the pond. Words escape me to describe how they made us feel and how happy we were to find their place on the last night of our long stay in Hawaii when all you need is a good rest for the night of travel ahead. Our hosts were wonderful enough and let us stay till 6pm which was something we didn't even dream of getting as our flight was the late one. Their cutest dogs are there to welcome you , but will not bug you if you are not a dog person.  The greatest regret we have is that we didn't discover this home for the whole week were staying in Hilo on the beginning of our trip. It would have been just the best thing, but we will come back and sure enough we will let everyone know about  Glenn and Mary. The location could not be better.. a walk away from the beach, but close enough to downtown Hilo and a breeze to access. Literally minutes drive on away from all the important places to see in Hilo, yet centrally located to all the sites to visit on the north side of the east coast as well as those south of Hilo and the Volcano National Park. If you are planning on staying and exploring the incredible beauty of the east side of Big Island, feel lucky if you are reading this and finding your dates available on Glenn and Mary's calendar.

Everything we could possibly need was in the room, directions for anything unfamiliar and thoughtful things like cold water in the fridge and extra toiletries in the bathroom not to mention the fresh flowers. Glenn and Mary are as available as you need them to be and very helpful and friendly. The location was perfect for us, Hilo has much more charm than Kona and still has many things to do and see. The Saturday farmers market in Hilo, the botanical garden and the beautiful eastern coast to name a few. If you're looking for a quiet, lush place to relax and resorts and crowds aren't your thing the Hilo side of the island is much better.

The space is very nicely decorated and the outdoor patio is fabulous! Its a wonderful space to unwind after a busy day in the city. The apartment is cozy but by NYC standards is a really great size. It is perfect for two couples. If you want to have a few friends come by the outdoor space is absolutely perfect for entertaining. Very large sofa area and ample dining space. Just be mindful of the sound level for neighbors in the units above when on the patio. The kitchen was well equipped with most everything you could need. There are lysol cleaning wipes, all necessary paper products, cleaning supplies, towels, robes, very nice shampoo, conditioner, soap, hairdryers, etc. Pots, pans, toaster, coffee and coffee maker, spices, chocolates, and a nice bottle of prosecco are all provided. Anything you might need for food and wine can be found a short walking distance away, or can be delivered. We really loved the location, the apartment, the private entrance, the communication with the owner and his assistant Natalia. We'd definitely stay here again. If you need more space than a standard 1bed/1bath hotel room can provide, this place is perfect."},{"_id":"66144968","date":{"$date":"2016-03-20T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1746726","reviewer_id":"8005722","reviewer_name":"Deborah","comments":"Lovely art-filled garden apartment with all the amenities - coffee (Nespresso), tons of fluffy towels, lovely soap and shampoo and conditioner, hairdryers in both bathrooms.

The Whitney Museum and galleries are mere blocks away.  Ditto three separate subway lines.  Also I run and the fact that the westside boardwalk has been re-done made for gorgeous runs.

Shampoo, conditioner  and shower gel are supplied and great quality. Prosecco in fridge was a lovely touch. Would highly recommend. Thank you Kris and Natalia."},{"_id":"331427301","date":{"$date":"2018-10-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1746726","reviewer_id":"12901","reviewer_name":"Xiaoxi","comments":"We had a great experience at Kris‚Äô place.

It as even better than described, in a nice location (Nice to be in a quiet space still so close to walk to most areas) and spotlessly clean with great amenities - to name just a few - newish large TV‚Äôs in the lounge and all bedrooms, great coffee machine and capsules, lots of towels.  The outside area would be awesome in Summer.  It was very easy to get around NYC from this location - we walked almost everywhere and used a few Uber‚Äôs.  There are some good restaurants close by - don‚Äôt miss the Tapas and Paella restaurant almost directly opposite the apartment: amazing service, food and cocktails.  Communication from Kris was super quick, friendly and helpful and check-in a breeze with Nicola.  Thanks Kris, for the lovely French sparkling and chocolates, they were greatly enjoyed on NYE!   Also, many thanks for the early check-in, it helped a lot after our 23 hour journey.   Hopefully, we can stay again on our next trip to NYC during spring or summer to enjoy the outside area."}]}

The lighting in the room is abysmal and no matter the time of day/windows open the space feels gloomy and dark. Just need to add some more central lighting to fix this.

Hard to bring up suitcases, and get up and down.  Some people cannot do stairs 2) the stove in the tiny kitchenette needs to be cleaned and fixed, or changed all together (the oven doesn't work), 3) it would be good to add some other chairs or stools.

The place has almost everything you might need at your own home except A/C. You need to climb stairs. But it's only for one floor. We didn't have any problem using it. The floor is wooden so it's a little bit creaky. Overall very good place to stay. Thank you Luc for being a great host."}]}

We didn't make much use of the kitchen but it is stocked with the basics if you want to eat in. The bed was comfortable but the sofa (which turns into a bed in the living room) was not ideal to sleep on.

Muito bem decorado, tudo cheira a novo, o apartamento tem todo o conforto que √© preciso para uma otima estadia, a limpeza, tanto do espa√ßo quanto das roupas de cama e banho, os utens√≠lios de cozinha, impecavelmente dispostos nos arm√°rios, c√°psulas de caf√© e sach√™s de ch√° como cortesia, os len√ß√≥is da cama muito bem alinhados, diga se de passagem, nem em algumas redes hoteleiras de 5* que conhe√ßo encontrei tantos cuidados com os detalhes.

We were 4 people and stayed there for one week. It worked out great with one bed and one sleep sofa. The whole apartment was clean and stylish. Especially the shower was awesome! Its close to the metro station casa da musica from which it takes 3 stops to the city centre. With Uber or Bus you're at the beach in approximatly 15 mins. The only thing we didnt find that good was the big street right next to the apartment.

We visited the historic areas as well as the waterfront and also Serralves (to see the gallery and the pink villa) and the beach at Matsinhos. Walking to the Jardin de palacios cristal (spelling?) was wonderful as it was not far and the gallery had an interesting exhibit and we liked the building‚Äôs design. Visiting the Lello bookstore and the landscape building near it were also great. The spaciousness and clean modern design of the apartment and the casa de musica plaza was a welcome contrast to the small medieval streets....very pleased with this selection and I will admit the thoughtfulness of providing some coffee etc was really lovely!

The area is quiet and kinda like Beverly hills of Hawaii. The room had the most beautiful view with a balcony Great for capturing the beautiful sun rise and looking out to an endless ocean. The room was a great size for two people. Clean towels daily and \"a bonus\" snacks for our pleasure in the communal living space (a separation from the main house but living room shared with other guest). The pool overlooked the ocean. Will, was such a great host and offered a true \"at home experience\" they even provided toiletries for guest who possibly forgot body wash or shampoo. Parking was not permitted in this community but that was not a problem the host offered rides up and down the hill at any hour and only took 5 minutes. If you are looking for a nice clean room, with a beautiful view, and a great host I recommend booking this location. Will is not only a host but now a friend and I know I will definitely be back. I  hope Will would be gracious enough to host me again.

He truly embraced the phrase \"make yourself at home\", by going and beyond to ensure our stay was pleasant and flawless. Strong, immediate and straightforward communication at all times meant pick-ups, drop-offs and requests were fulfilled promptly. The entire host-guest interaction was friendly and non-intrusive.\nThe bedroom, bathroom, kitchenette, lounge and dining areas were consistently kept clean and perfectly maintained, with daily maid service. This included an unheard of perk of daily laundry done for stays over 3-nights.\nThe ocean views are unparalleled and A MUST-SEE is the sunrise, from the balcony adjacent to the bedrooms. No noise, fan in bedroom, all amenities included.\nConvenient location (7-min from Hanauma Bay, 10-min from Waikiki, 5-min from major highways and supermarkets).\nThis place is a true rare find.

I've stayed at a variety of airbnb's on the island but Will's home tops them all in beauty and tranquility. Will is a true superhost. Quick to respond via text and very professional. The pictures do not do the home justice. The kitchen area is stocked with an abundance of snacks, coffee, tea's, milk, creamer, bottled water, soft drinks, etc. \nThere is a refreshing breeze 24/7, and the evenings are very comfortable given that the home is on a hill. The neighborhood is one of the most secure and quite in the island, so the doors and windows can all be left wide open. The other guests in the home were very quiet and respectful of each other. You have your own bathroom, but mine was down the stairs in the pool area as the one adjacent to my room was for my neighbor. Due to security, you park at the base of the hill in a park (safe area), and Will chauffeurs you to and from the home (just needs 10 minute notice before you arrive or want to step out) any time of the day or night. Walking around the neighborhood is also a no go given the high level of privacy desired by this community. However, once you see the view from your bedroom/balcony, or pool and the amenities Will has, you will have no desire to leave the home except to go to the beach, to dine, or explore the island. If you have a car, I highly recommend staying at Will's home!!!"},{"_id":"290107145","date":{"$date":"2018-07-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17639835","reviewer_id":"170003577","reviewer_name":"Melanie","comments":"It was a perfect Time and a great place!

His shuttle service to parking allowed time for him to give us tips on traffic, parking, scheduling activities, where to eat, and where to shop.  Will has a great sense of humor and really enjoyed his take on local culture and events. \n\nAir B\u0026B did not have the correct address for the property, but Will drove out and met us (on arrival in Oahu we had some problems accessing the e-mail message he had sent with the correct address for the parking lot) and we were able to easily follow him to find parking. \n\nAs the listing states, we found this to be a very safe neighborhood, and after the first day it did not bother us to leave the doors and windows open to the tropical breezes. I have suggested to Will that a key lock for the room door, with a matching keyed lock for the private bathroom - downstairs by the pool as the listing states - would provide an extra measure of assurance of safety - and security when one is out touring around Oahu.  \n\nThe location was perfect, especially having a car, which I recommend. It is a short drive into Waikiki (park near the zoo for free) and an even shorter drive to Hanauma Bay and the famous blow hole and beach. There are plenty of amenities close by, and If you give Will a bit of notice, he will have the hot tub ready for you after a full day of touring.  \n\nThe rooms were clean, and the bed was very comfortable. No air conditioning, but the tropical breeze (assisted by the ceiling fan) was constant, and we slept vey well.\n\nThe two bedrooms on this floor would be ideal for two close couples or a family of four, and the pool and hot tub are for the exclusive use of the guests in these two rooms.\n\nThe decor could use some updating, but with all there is to do on Oahu, we didn‚Äôt have time to sit around the apartment anyway."},{"_id":"326229359","date":{"$date":"2018-09-21T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17639835","reviewer_id":"168813927","reviewer_name":"Robyn","comments":"Just as the pictures show, the house is gorgeous, the view outstanding.

This is one of the best Airbnb we have stayed in. The neighborhood is in a prestigious gated community. There is no parking on the premise; parking was down the hill (VERY SAFE). Will is there 24/7 to shuttle us to our car. Location was just perfect, not too far from Honolulu/Waikiki. Diamond Head and Hanauma Bay is less than 5 miles away. It is close to the main highway and lots of local places around to check out. The house was beautiful, clean and spacious. A plus is that this is a very safe gated community. One night @ around 2am, I had left my wallet in the car and Will was one text away and within 5 minutes he was there to take me down to the car. Will treated us like Family and was always genuinely helpful and communicative. Whatever we needed / questions he is always a text or a phone call away. I cannot thank him enough for everything.\n\nOur room was always cleaned, fresh towels were always stocked. Falling asleep with the windows open and listening to the ocean breeze was just full bliss and the sunrise every morning was spectacular. The views from every window will take your breath away. We will definitely be coming back to visit! Thank you so much Will!"},{"_id":"348187172","date":{"$date":"2018-11-12T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17639835","reviewer_id":"86462752","reviewer_name":"Quinn","comments":"Will‚Äôs space was such an amazing experience.

His shuttle service is available 24/7 and he was always courteous and punctual when it came to pick up or drop down us for the day. The photos cannot show the most beautiful view from his villa! Sunrises from the balcony were breathtaking. In the evening you can also submerge in jacuzzi and watch the stars. Community is safe and very quite. We never even locked our door during stay.

The pool definitely had not been cleaned for quite some time and the jacuzzi did not heat up. The bathroom does have a jacuzzi, but when we went to turn it on, there was debris coming out of the jets as it hadn't been used since who knows when. Will is a very nice and accommodating host, but its unfortunately not enough considering how much the room costs and the fact that you're in Hawaii. I'm also quite disappointed that we had to be shuttled in and out of the property throughout the whole trip. Although Will was available anytime to give us a ride, it definitely took time out of our trip, especially if we just wanted to head back to our airbnb just to freshen up before heading back out. If you were hoping to avoid paying more for a hotel, evaluate your budget and try to go that route instead. The location is quite far from Waikiki, the amenities were either not working or not clean, and its quite inconvenient to be shuttled in and out of the property."},{"_id":"369231000","date":{"$date":"2019-01-09T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17639835","reviewer_id":"227079022","reviewer_name":"Daniele","comments":"Incredible House on top of the hill.

However I found the reviews on the listing to be inaccurate. There are two long term male residents that live within this apartment listing. I would not recommend this listing for hypervigilant travelers/single women as there were no locks on the bathroom, nor shower doors. The doors on these two are sliding doors which made me uncomfortable that anyone could have entered at any time while I was inside. The bathroom and shower are separated by a frosted window, which I could see the outline of the person's body in the bathroom while I was in the shower. \nThere is a reason why the bathroom and shower photos are unlisted, please be aware of this before booking this option."},{"_id":"244560885","date":{"$date":"2018-03-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17663877","reviewer_id":"20205968","reviewer_name":"Vikki","comments":"I would definitely stay here again.

And unfortunately, that review got posted only a couple days prior to my arrival. Because of my personal work and travel and visiting circumstances, I decided it was too difficult for me to try to find a new place and I stayed for the duration of my planned visit (6nights). I find many of these reviews and the description of this posting to be inaccurate. However, the 3 hosts (2 males and Katherine) running this place were kind and responsive. I personally also manage short-term and long-term sublets and vacation rentals and an inaccurate listing to book more guests is, as nicely as I can say it - not cool. There were some good things here and I did stick out my stay. See below for details. --This is set-up like a hostel. 4 rooms total - 2 male residents and 1 other Airbnb room. (When booking on the Airbnb App it does not say \"hostel\"! This is an App issue) --This is NOT an apartment (as is described), nor is this an apartment complex (my assumption). There are many apartment complexes in this area and so I was fooled. And with real estate booming in Honolulu, it seemed reasonable for a commercial building to be transformed. This was NOT transformed. --This is an office/commercial lease. Within an office/commercial building. --This space is not and was not intended for living. --The kitchen is really a kitchenette (per reasons listed above). --The kitchen was dirty and smelled mildewy. When I asked for the kitchen to be cleaned they did, very kindly, do their best. But because this space was not meant for living, it was difficult. And new dish rags / drying towels were needed. --(per reasons listed above) There are no windows in the room or space. This was hard for me. --Even though the room is listed as non-smoking, the shared space smelled like smoke (smoking occurred in the space). The room itself did not smell and was fine. --The parking lot is NOT $6! This is intentionally inaccurate. The parking guard told me that by mid-April the lot would be 'automated' pay, which will increase the hourly rate. There will not be a guard in this lot (who currently only works daytime). Currently the $6 refers to business hours (9am-5/6pm) on business days when the guard is working. After that and on weekends and holidays, the cost is pre-pay $1/hour/cash, paid into a drop-box. Again, this cost will be increasing. Makes sense since this is for a commercial parking lot and is not residential. You'll have to be comfortable playing the parking game, finding street parking and moving your car around. I did OK, but I wish this was more honestly stated. Fixes/improvements since past reviews: --The translucent glass on the bathroom and shower doors got painted. Thank you. --Locks were placed on the doors. --The shower got cleaned. The good: --The room itself was accurate. Decent. Cleaned. --The toilet..."},{"_id":"256495152","date":{"$date":"2018-04-22T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17663877","reviewer_id":"123520393","reviewer_name":"Aria","comments":"Good pace for this price!"},{"_id":"257601454","date":{"$date":"2018-04-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17663877","reviewer_id":"7265451","reviewer_name":"Chandrasegaran","comments":"Katherine,  Am I glad that you accepted my request fo my brief Stay in your lodging.I shall look forward to meeting you  next time.

Both times were pleasant!  The rooms are not fancy, but they are comfortable.  If all you need is a place to sleep, then this place offers a great value.  Even though the bathrooms are shared, I rarely had to wait to use them.  The other shared spaces (kitchen, etc.) are on the older side, but they still have the basic conveniences, including washer/dryer if you bring your own detergent.  The neighborhood can be a little noisy and the walls are kind of thin, but this did not really bother me.  Plus the rooms have air conditioning, which is not always offered in other places.

Showers is small thus i dont reccomend for a heavier person. I hit my head n shoulder twice.\n\nPro: Family was kind. The room beautifully decorated. The location is convenient (10 mins walk to metro) and safe. The room cleanliness is overall ok. Private parking next to door aka side of the house. The bed is medium firm, lots of pillows, tv has verizon cable but tv volumn cannot be changed and stayed medium to low volume. Mini refrig and microwave was a great touch and very clean, instant krogers coffee, lil complements, and steam water pot was provided.\n\nOverall, we enjoyed our stay which could be 5 stars if the house alarm was not the issue."},{"_id":"223740932","date":{"$date":"2018-01-01T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17665996","reviewer_id":"39874541","reviewer_name":"Zoraida","comments":"Linelle‚Äôs place was very cozy, clean, and warm.

We did not feel cramped at all. \nLinelle responded promptly to communications so since this was my first time using airbnb, she took the worry out of the experience. \nI would definitely be open to coming back here again and would recommend this spot to other travelers."},{"_id":"261490769","date":{"$date":"2018-05-06T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17665996","reviewer_id":"157984794","reviewer_name":"Grace","comments":"Linelle's place was an excellent weekend getaway. She had stocked the apartment with linens, snacks, drinks, bath and body needs. I wasn't expecting for her to have half of what she did. She was very quick when responding to my texts. The area itself was okay, but the street Linelle lives on was very quiet. We were 5 minutes away from the beach, and 10 minutes from town where there were lively restaurants and clubs. I would recommend checking out Cabana or Speakeasy for dinner if you are visiting this area. We had such a nice stay. Thank you Linelle!"},{"_id":"271515660","date":{"$date":"2018-06-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17665996","reviewer_id":"28629445","reviewer_name":"Leonid","comments":"I rented this space just for one night, it was perfect get away for me from my my apt in Harlem.

Not only because it was literally blocks away from my boyfriends relatives but the location made it so easy to access the beach \u0026 the train. It was also a quiet location. I am big on SLEEP. I‚Äôm a light sleeper and I wasn‚Äôt disturbed once the 4 nights I stayed here. \n\nSo there is a train station that is literally 2 blocks away from this place. It took me about 3 minutes to walk there. The entrance to the beach is actually right next to the train station. You can either go to your right and walk up the steps or keep straight and walk onto the beach once you turn on the block of the train station. \n\nLinelle gave clear and specific directions on where the room was located and how to gain access. It has its own entrance which was perfect. Coming in late wasn‚Äôt an issue because we didn‚Äôt have to worry about disturbing anyone in the home. During the day you could hear footsteps upstairs being that the room is at the lower level but it wasn‚Äôt a concern. If you‚Äôve ever lived in an apartment on the lower level, that‚Äôs what its like. Our privacy was respected which was greatly appreciated. I did get the pleasure to meet Linelle coming in from dinner one evening. Very nice \u0026 welcoming. \n\nThe neighborhood seems like a neighborhood where everyone kind of knows each other. The neighbors were respectful and spoke when you walked by. \n\nAs for the room, it was gorgeously decorated. I felt right at home. The bathroom was stocked with different shampoos, conditioners, \u0026 body washes. There was a wardrobe that was also stocked with clean linen \u0026 towels. There is a dresser to store your clothes and belongings. A fridge and microwave as listed. On top of the microwave were little snacks like popcorn as well as condiments. I didn‚Äôt think there would be an iron so I packed mines but turns out there was an iron as well as an ironing board. \n\nOverall my experience here was amazing. Highly recommended."},{"_id":"293554058","date":{"$date":"2018-07-20T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17665996","reviewer_id":"186480834","reviewer_name":"Murvyn","comments":"A nice cozy place to stay and have your privacy."},{"_id":"298550574","date":{"$date":"2018-07-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17665996","reviewer_id":"56408159","reviewer_name":"Darius","comments":"Definitely a home away from home.

The water in the kitchen is not connected to the hot water cylinder. If you really need to wash something with hot water, will need to boil the kettle and add to sink.

Airbnb. experience. EVER. The studio was perfect for us, with kitchen and patio space. The host is the sweetest I've never met :-) The location is silly, you can't throw a rock without hitting a Michelin rated restaurant, many of them reasonably priced and even doable with a toddler. Yes. Toddler.  There are two grocery stores just on her block, though again, with the restaurant options, why bother? Oh! because sometimes it is lovely to just relax on her patio with a glass of wine and snacks and a moment of privacy in this busy and beautiful city. There is some construction happening in the area, so if you like to sleep in that might be the only *minor* hesitation. But honestly, you're in Hong Kong - sleep can happen when you go home ;-)\nAnd Katya was beyond thoughtful and accommodating with all of our questions and late arrival. How should I wrap this up?

We were only able to book the place a few days before our trip, but we were lucky to have chanced on this gem of a house. \n\nWhile most apartments in Hong Kong are small and have just enough space for sleep and daily activities, Katya‚Äôs space was slightly larger than the norm and had a beautiful terrace that overlooked a quiet street. The apartment was opposite a construction site during the time that we rented the space, it also meant that the street was secluded while still being in a central location in which most of the bars and restaurants were within walking distance. The construction also only started at later times and our sleep was never disturbed! \n\nWe were in Hong Kong for the art events that were taking place and we were happy that the apartment was near H Queens and we could access Art Central and Art Basel by walking (although that was of a slightly longer distance so we took Uber instead.) The apartment was also near some of the cool, hip shops and cafes which meant that it was easy to drop off items that we bought before heading to another location. \n\nKatya also left little notes around the house and a booklet which made us feel welcomed and comfortable at this space. She also provided some bottles of water and some snacks which was really nice after a tiring flight. \n\nThis was definitely one of our best experiences in an airbnb in Hong Kong and would love to stay in this great place if we ever visited Hong Kong in future!"},{"_id":"251031959","date":{"$date":"2018-04-07T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17672629","reviewer_id":"44177381","reviewer_name":"Chirayu","comments":"Excellent location and nice room though the room was a bit too dusty and did not have any shampoo or soap."},{"_id":"298080148","date":{"$date":"2018-07-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17672629","reviewer_id":"10959050","reviewer_name":"Thomas","comments":"Great location, surprisingly quiet.

Bed Stuy boasts some of the most classic architecture of Brooklyn and beautiful tree lined streets and is the destination of many film makers. Countless TV show and films set in NYC or BK has been filmed, at least in part, in Bed Stuy, often transforming the streets into a scene from the late 1800's because that's when all of these homes were built! Boardwalk Empire, The Knick and countless other shows are filmed here.  We've got a great selection of hip restaurants and cafes in the neighborhood and one of NYC's finest restaurants, Saraghina, is just around the corner. We've also got a French restaurant just on the next block!

It makes for a great bed for one person and if you are a party of five or six we will make it up as a bed with linens and pillows. It's like sleeping on a cloud!","transit":"We are only 0.6 miles away from two different metro stations serving three different trains. Our favorite is the Halsey street J train which runs above ground on parts of Broadway so you get a rare view from on high using our favorite train! Using the A/C trains you can get to places in Manhattan like the 9/11 memorial in 35 minutes door to door or be in the heart of the Lower East Side (Essex Market) in just 30 minutes! Other destinations further north take a little longer but everything is within reach of our house! Williamsburg is 20 minutes away using the metro.","access":"You'll have exclusive access to everything you see in the pictures including the deck.

Savannah was great and very helpful. I'd definitely stay here again! My family and I all had more than enough room in this HUGE home! I always have pretty great experiences when I stay in Airbnbs, but this was by far the best I've ever seen. The value for the amount of space and all the amenities (washer and dryer! Score!) felt like I was let in on a little secret of Brooklyn. Thanks again, Savannah!

We didn't use the kitchen but it was lovey and seemed ready to prepare a feast if that's your fancy. We really appreciated the washer and dryer as it was super hot and humid while we visited, so we threw clothes in the washer once we arrived home from exploring for the day. The neighbors were friendly and we felt safe walking anytime, morning and night. Savannah and Carsten were super helpful and answered all of our questions quickly. They also suggested the Honduran restaurant when we requested a recommendation. We ate at Milk and Pull and Natural Blend around the corner on Malcolm X and enjoyed it. We also ate at La Perla Del Ulua a short and cheap Uber or Lyft ride (less than $10) away. The restaurant is authentic Honduran, we enjoyed the carne asada, baleada, and tajeditas con carne. It is cash only and the a service was a little inattentive but the restaurant was slow and the waitress was quick to respond to any of our requests. My Honduran husband was please with the traditional cuisine and we always appreciate being able to get a little taste of home.

Pics depicted exactly as her home is and would move into a home like this tomorrow, very quirky and lovely design features.\nSubway about 15 min walk from house which was no problem in morning but in the evening after shopping / sightseeing felt like a hike.  One of the three nights we stayed we had comments made at us by people on the stoops as we passed by which was a little uncomfortable.\nReally lovely outside area at the house but would benefit by table chairs on the deck as downstairs area felt as if it belonged to downstairs neighbours and weather would encourage outside living which we couldn't experience.\nThe house felt like someone else's home and that we were somewhat intruding, there was food left in the fridge and freezer, yet the dinnerware available was not suitable for 4 guests or cooking dinners.  Aircon in house very noisy but nothing good earplugs won't sort out.\nOn our last night there was what sounded like gunshots outside the house with a police helicopter hovering above for most of night and next morning when we left.  This may have just been an isolated incident that we were unfortunate enough to happen upon.\nPutting the negatives aside, we loved the house."},{"_id":"184383007","date":{"$date":"2017-08-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17681470","reviewer_id":"45135740","reviewer_name":"G√∂rkem","comments":"Savannah's place is located in the heart of Brooklyn.

We were traveling to Porto in a rental car. It happened to be a national day of celebration and many businesses were closing early. Our attempts to contact the car rental car office in Porto to confirm their hours were unsuccessful. Out of desperation we contacted Vanessa and asked if she could possibly find out for us. She actually took time out of her day and dropped by their office and very quickly let us know that they would be closing two hours earlier than the hours posted on their website. When we thanked her she said it was no problem as she was in that part of town anyway, but her without her kindness we would have been faced with a late car return the next day. Vanessa's gracious hospitality did not end there as she had lots of insights and suggestions that she shared about restaurants, sights and transportation that made our stay even more enjoyable. The welcoming port wine and cookies was also a nice touch.\nRosita house is on a quiet street within easy walking distance of great restaurants, shopping, sightseeing and public transportation.

You can get woken up by drunken tourists (mostly) yelling or giggling. As we‚Äôre young, we just fell right back to sleep but now you know. \n\nBut the flat is so well situated that can‚Äôt miss the opportunity just for the light and noise: we were at 15min tops from anything in Porto! From the bridge, riverside, any attraction you want or restaurant! The other way around is quite longer because of the hard slopes! :-) But it‚Äôs Portuguese style! We loved it! The direct street is really calm and silent, just behind a busy neighborhood which you can get in maybe 45sec. A must!\n\nVanessa is charming and really accommodating! She takes care of everything, even got us a cab for our way back to the airport! :-) She also left us Port and biscuits, an all the necessaries you could imagine: sweet, salt, toilet paper, sponge, etc.\n\nWill recommend greatly!

Eigentlich perfekt. \n\nLeider hat der in der Wohnung zu h√∂rende L√§rm den Aufenthalt teilweise zur Qual gemacht, so dass ich diesen vorzeitig abbrechen musste (s. unten). Die noch einige Zeit existierende Gro√übaustelle im Nebenhaus wurde in der Beschreibung leider verschwiegen. Ab 7:30 Uhr morgens sind Bohren und H√§mmern oft durchgehend bis abends in teils unertr√§glicher Lautst√§rke zu h√∂ren. Aber auch ohne diese Baustelle sind Vibrationen und Rumpeln der Metrolinien bis 1 Uhr nachts und ab ca. 5 Uhr morgens zu h√∂ren. F√ºr Personen mit leichtem Schlaf sicher eine Herausforderung.\n\nDer Gastgeber AB Apartments (Eva \u0026 Jacques) ist ein gewerblicher Apartmentverwalter von fast 200 Apartments und kennt daher zwangsl√§ufig nicht die tats√§chliche Situation jedes einzelnen Apartments. Bereits die Frage, ob das Schlafzimmer zur Stra√üe heraus liegt, konnte nicht beantwortet werden. Nachteilig ist ebenfalls, dass man die Schl√ºssel zur Unterkunft nur im B√ºro von AB Apartments abholen kann und nicht direkt am Apartment. \nAB Apartments konnte mir immerhin eine deutlich g√ºnstigere Ausweichunterkunft anbieten, verweigerte aber die Erstattung der Differenz. Nur durch die Mediationsstelle von Airbnb konnte eine Erstattung erreicht werden.\n\nDamit √ºberwiegen die negativen Erfahrungen mit Eva \u0026 Jacques leider die positiven.\n\n\nENGLISH\nThe apartment is very well furnished and has a good view to the Placa de Catalunya. Nearly perfect. \n\nUnfortunately, the noise to be heard in the apartment made the stay partly a torture, so that I had to cancel the stay prematurely (see below). The construction site in the adjoining house was unfortunately not mentioned in the description. From 7:30 in the morning, drilling and hammering can often be heard continuously until evening, sometimes at unbearable volume. But even without this construction site, vibrations and rumbling of the metro lines can be heard until 1 o'clock at night and from about 5 o'clock in the morning. A challenge for people with a light night's sleep.\n\nThe host AB Apartments (Eva \u0026 Jacques) is a commercial apartment manager of almost 200 apartments and therefore inevitably does not know the actual situation of each individual apartments. Already the question whether the bedroom is facing the street could not be answered. Another disadvantage is that the keys to the accommodation can only be picked up in the office of AB Apartments and not directly at the apartment. \nAfter all, AB Apartments could offer me a notably cheaper alternative accommodation to the noisy apartment, but refused to refund the difference. Only through the mediation center of Airbnb a refund could be achieved.\n\nThus the negative experiences with Eva \u0026 Jacques unfortunately outweigh the positive ones."},{"_id":"331343345","date":{"$date":"2018-10-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17726001","reviewer_id":"6407331","reviewer_name":"Beth","comments":"We had great communication from the host \u0026 the check in (located at an office near by) was really efficient !

In the streets that surround Casa Flores you will smell the aroma of the worldwide famous nectar, Port Wine. If your going for a tasting you just need to walk out the front door and go for a few metres to the most renowned cellars: Offley, Sandeman, Cal√©m, Ferreirinha, etc. And if you enjoy good food as much as good wine try the typical restaurants in the neighbouring streets. Or you can always buy some genuine produce in the grocery stores next door, take it home and cook your own portuguese inspired meal.","notes":"","transit":"We suggest that you walk and explore the surroundings, go across the river through the D.

We really enjoyed chatting with her and all the suggestions she provided us with of places to visit in and around Kona. Also, we loved playing with her cute and friendly dog. The place is located in a good  spot in Kona that was fairly quiet and close to the beach. We would still recommend having a rental car or using the trolley to get around the rest of Kona. The condo itself is old and there was a few plumbing issues and leaks during our stay which wasn't so fun to deal with while on vacation. Now saying that Dominique was very quick to have the problems resolved and acted professionally. The bed was comfortable and we slept well but the curtains are thin and a lot of light shines through the windows around 6:30am, it didn't really bother us as we are early risers but to others it may be annoying. A lot of guests buy beach chairs, umbrellas, mats etc. during there stay and then have left it at the house which you are able to borrow when going to the beach.

The apartment was very modern and equipped with all the necessities a family of 2, 3, or 4 may need.  It is located in one the most beautiful locations in Barcelona. Every morning we had the options of a cafe right downstairs or fresh fruits or an upscale supermarket 2 blocks away. Our son is very finicky with food so it was cool to have chicken wings and fries as an option at the corner (lol) You are in walking distance of all the local transportation (metro). Taxis are readily available right outside your door which are affordable when going to the city. My husband actually ran 3 miles to the beach took a swim and ran back, that's how convenient this location is. Just wanted to say very special thank you to Jacque For making our first time using air bnb a superb experience. You are what one dreams of when doing business from abroad or locally. You were consistent, punctual, caring, alert to our concerns and most importantly and this where most people doing business fail......you communicated consistently and made us feel like you genuinely cared about our well being. For that my my family and I thank you considerably. We look forward to contacting you in the near future for other trips abroad...btw we will be referring you as we have already begun to do to many of our close friends and associates.

E\u0026J are very responsive to any requests, and answered all of our questions very quickly through email or text. A few very minor things were highlighted and E\u0026J sent maintenance people that day to sort it out. very impressive.\nApartment is located in the Eixample District which is positioned between the hubub of the main town, and the Sants and Placa d'Espanya areas, so generally well located for all needs. It is ideal for families as it is a quiet area, although there can be some traffic noise as the apartment is on a busy road (but for children this is better than party people shouting and bottles smashing you would get in the centre of town, and the combination of very good double glazing and air-conditioning was not an issue at all). \nOur kids loved the offset bunkbeds, which meant bed time was a synch.\nThe area seemed to be in the process of a regeneration, and we even noticed a BrewDog on the corner one block away which could be a good or bad sign! but in general a lovely friendly neighbourhood.\nThe only minor negatives (as mentioned by others) the shower was rubbish and needs replacing, and the kitchen could do with a few more basic utensils.\nBut to sum up. we are already planning our next trip to Barcelona, and we plan to stay with E\u0026J. thank you Eva \u0026 Jacques for a great introduction to a lovely city."},{"_id":"308338907","date":{"$date":"2018-08-16T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17742384","reviewer_id":"197541395","reviewer_name":"Rauni","comments":"Mkt bra l√§ge!

This is a one bedroom apartment with three tiny balconies overlooking to a small street perpendicular to the greater street passing along the beaches. The ocean is near and one can see it from the balconies just turning head to the left. And definetely one can hear the ocean from the apartment. There was not much furniture in the apartment, but all the necessary  items (double bed, tables, chairs, sofa, wardrobes, etc.) were there. The apartment was equipped with electric stove with oven, dish washer, microwave oven, coffee machines, washing machine and TV. Although the last one didn't work (I suppose because of unpaid cable subscription) - but who needs a TV when the ocean is nearby!\nThere was no Wi-Fi, but there was excellent coverage for Vodafone 4G prepaid SIM card in the apartment.\nWe stayed in the apartment at October and it was quite cold in it. The problem is that the sun never looks at the narrow street and the apartment windows. Although I suppose it may be a good feature during summer hot weather. As for free parking near the beaches - this feature is definetely better during cold seasons - during summer it might be crowded.\nFor me the bed matress was too hard and be prepared that one night you may be attacked by mosquitos (get ready a fumigator).\nWhen I was booking the apartment via Airbnb I corresponded with Natalia who spoke Portuguese only, but when I arrived I've got a phone call from a man (speaking English and French) who said that he was owner of the apartment. The keys were given to me by the man's sister who provided me very good introduction in plain English (I'd like to thank her again here!). Unfortunately I could not contact the owner directly because the phone number given at the site was unreachable. A day before leave I was visited by a Portuguese only speaking man who said he was another owner of the apartment. In result I little bit puzzled, but anyway I enjoyed the staying there! Thank you very much, the misterious owner!"}]}

Eixample was designed by Catalan-born urban planning visionary, Ildefons Cerd√†, who took traffic and sunlight (amongst many other things) into consideration when creating the plans for this new district. Eixample is now characterised by its octagonal blocks and its grid-like pattern, with wide streets and both commercial and residential areas. It is split into two parts, Eixample Esquerra (Left, or in Spanish, Izquierdo) and Eixample Dret (Right, or in Spanish, Derecho), both of which are home to some fantastic restaurants and stores. Eixample Izquierdo is delimited by the grand, Passeig de Gr√†cia, a paradise for shopping and dining, and Pla√ßa d¬¥Espanya, where the Montju√Øc Magic Fountain and one of the biggest convention centres in Barcelona can be found.

Comfortable beds and living area.  The shower stall is very small in the second bathroom and the hot water was somewhat erratic when people were getting ready in the morning.  Quiet at night and excellent window blinds to block light.\n\nYou will be using Metro a lot as this neighborhood is not itself full of sights or shopping.   Metro stop is about 8-10 minutes walk away.  The Barcelona metro system is excellent and clean.  \n\nThis place is managed by a large rental company which does make it seem a bit impersonal.   For checking in, you have to go to the rental office, then it is a long walk with luggage (especially in the heat) to get to the apartment.  The city blocks are really long in Barcelona!  Also, there were a couple strange things like having service personnel enter the apartment without asking or notifying us, and requiring guests to empty all apartment trash at checkout and put it into a dumpster down the street.  They did solicit guest input so I do have hope that these issues are addressed.  \n\nJacques and Eva, the Airbnb hosts, were outstanding and very quick in responding to our questions and offering assistance.  They checked in with  us via the Airbnb throughout our stay and offered to arrange a taxi if we needed it."},{"_id":"280956904","date":{"$date":"2018-06-24T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17757695","reviewer_id":"45764860","reviewer_name":"Paul","comments":"Definitely great value for money.

It was updated and big enough for a couple and a third traveler. The rooms were not very big but for a city apartment, not too bad. It's probably helpful to know that one of the showers is European size which means if you're over 6 feet with broad shoulders, you probably can't fit in it. The beds were ok but  not super comfortable. We hoped the two single beds could be joined for extra room but they were different heights. Also, we were surprised to see that the courtyard (one of the main reasons we booked this space) was not on the room but in the middle of the apartment complex, on the ground level, and surrounded by other apartments. The only important issue we had during our stay was lack of internet for four out of the five days we were there which affected our ability to research and plan activities. The property management company attributed it to a building-wide issue. Lastly, only one person at a time could shower. There seemed to be very little cold water so one person ended up showering with excruciatingly hot water.  I notified the host for this issue but there was no acknowledgement of the issue or action taken."},{"_id":"292943334","date":{"$date":"2018-07-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17757695","reviewer_id":"13470495","reviewer_name":"Laura","comments":"Eva and Jacques were very responsive to questions. The apartment manager was very helpful and responsive, and are available 24 hours/day to sort out problems and answer questions. The keys are picked up from an office which is at a different location from the apartment, some renters may need to take a taxi if unable to walk with luggage (although the distance is walkable for some people). The apartment is well-located and easy walk to Placa Catalunya,  there are many restaurants, stores, taxis outside your doorstep. It is quiet at night. Be aware that there is a cat in the lobby and with that comes cat hair, litter box etc, which may not be desirable for everyone. The inside of the apartment was very clean, sparsely decorated with 4 dining chairs and a small couch. It has clean, comfortable beds and bedding/towels. Plan to bring own soaps, laundry, cleaning supplies,  etc as the limited supplies provided will not last for longer than a day or two.

Our only issue was that the heater in the bedroom has a very loud fan that came on frequently during the night and kept us from having a restful sleep at night. A white noise machine was offered, but that in  itself is constant noise. So if you are a light sleeper,it might not be the place for you during heating season. If you do stay, try the arepas or breakfast bowls at nearby Tinto.

I provide a 24 hour point of contact for guests. I do my best to keep the place perfectly maintained and hire professional cleaners  to make sure the place is in impeccable condition for incoming guests.

Several parts of the apartment are in a state of disrepair including the blind in the main bedroom which is hanging by a cable tie and  is completely dysfunctional.

There is a bit of noise from the upstairs tenants and from the street as the apartment/bedroom is located along the street path.

At first we were a little bummed to not get a courtyard, but the new unit was very spacious and well decorated with brand new appliances and features so we were ultimately fine with the switch. The location of the place is fantastic with restaurants, shops, and transportation just a couple of blocks away. However, the street its located on is fairly busy so if you're a light sleeper bring some ear plugs with you as cars and people pass by at all hours of the day and night. Also while the bathroom in the unit was nice and new, the floor does tend to get wet from the shower so bring some flip-flops to use in there! But overall we had a nice stay!

What initially started as a bad experience because of the overwhelming cigarette smell was improved when our host Elise came to freshen up the place that same night. Overall, an okay experience until the last day when it ended up being awful because of Elise‚Äôs passive aggressive and rude attitude. We asked Elise if we could leave our luggage after we checked out because we were gonna be in town all day and didn‚Äôt want to keep our luggages with us. In my messages I repeated multiple times that I would pick up my luggage in the evening. Elise agreed and in my thank you message I said we would swing by at night, she said have a good evening. Her instructions included washing the dishes and taking out the trash (which to my fault I didn‚Äôt see but we only left two dishes and left the trash in the basket). She stated we should be out by 10, we left the Airbnb at 9 and left our bags packed. I received an incredibly passive aggressive call at 3 asking why we hadn‚Äôt picked up the luggages and saying the place looked like a pig-stye (actual wording she used). The message had never stated a time to pick up the luggage and I had said evening/night at least three times in my request. She was extremely passive aggressive and disrespectful on the call. She asked when we would pick up the luggage because she had a dinner party that she would have to leave early from if we came in the evening. After stating that it would be incredibly inconvenient for her to leave her dinner party early multiple times, she then said she would have to charge us for keeping our luggage there. I firmly disagreed because it was not something she had mentioned before or something we had agreed to. I simply stated that if she had wanted to charge a fee she should‚Äôve stated that before. She then began to ask if we were gonna leave a bad review, which genuinely came out of nowhere. I said no and she said that if we were gonna leave a bad review we were to come and pick up our bags immediately, but if we were gonna leave a good review we should chill where we were and we could come at night to pick up our bags. I thought this caveat was unprofessional, especially considering no time was set for us earlier. We were unhappy with this caveat so we said we would come pick up our bags immediately. She said that meant we were gonna leave a bad review and so she was gonna leave the Airbnb because she felt ‚Äúthreatened‚Äù (actual words again). The phone call was an awful 9 minutes that I would never repeat again. The phone call sourly ended with Elise saying she couldn‚Äôt wait..."},{"_id":"270942510","date":{"$date":"2018-05-30T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17829178","reviewer_id":"10047214","reviewer_name":"Bohan","comments":"Great place!

She was helpful and easy to reach, especially since she lives in the same building. The appartment is beautiful, clean and comfortable. It must have been renovated very recently, as everything looks brand new. It is located close to the river, the restaurants, bridge, etc. The location is ideal but it is also on a commercial street so bear in mind that it gets active pretty early in the morning as shop owners prepare for the day. The seagulls and other animals also get going early so you may have to get up and close the windows if you want to sleep in.  The area is quite peaceful at night, though.

He met us and directed us where to park.  The parking garage is just across the street from the apartment.  We then all walked over to the apartment where he showed us to our home for the next 3 days. The first thing I noticed was how amazing the apartment smelled.  Everything was spotless and even better than the pictures described.  The bed was extremely comfortable and the black out shades allowed us to sleep in which we hadn't done on our vacation until then. The location of the apartment was perfect and quiet although close to everything.  In the morning we would heard fado music as we walked down the street.  Such a quaint area of the city.

Because of omissions in the listing and events that occurred after my arrival, I chose not to stay.\n\nFanny offered to email a list of places to eat. I left the US on the 19th. The email was received on the 20th. Because of limited internet access and Data Roaming Charges, I was not checking my email after I left home.\n\nI left my bag at the room while I was searching for parking. The room is off the kitchen. It was 83 degrees outside that evening and the room was even warmer. The bed and a fan were next to the window. I could see the patio table and chairs from my pillow. Fanny apologized, saying the comforter was in the dryer. We laughed thinking it was not needed. \n\nAs I have done many times before, I prefer to park my car and walk a city. Parking here is limited to parking meters or Resident Permit parking. There are no parking garages. There is no off street parking. Construction on side streets further reduced available parking. While walking I was bumped by a motorist coming out of an alley and hit a second time by a bicyclist traveling in the wrong direction. I spent 20 minutes circling the neighborhood looking for parking. Meanwhile, the police, a tow truck, and an ambulance were collecting a motorcyclist at the corner of Av Laurier and Saint Urbain in front of Lio Fratelli. \n\nI invested a considerable amount of time planning my trip to Montreal. It was not my plan to spend a beautiful summer evening driving in traffic translating No Parking signs. Had I known in advance that there was no parking, I would have spent the $200 for air conditioning, room service,  and parking elsewhere. It was not worth the risk to stay. I was looking forward to seeing this great city. After driving seventeen hours, I drove another five and I arrived at home in the the US at 12:30 AM\n\n"},{"_id":"296366871","date":{"$date":"2018-07-25T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17861859","reviewer_id":"6608056","reviewer_name":"New","comments":"Fanny's place is very cute, clean, and homey.

I have to thank Philip in particular for helping me check in their apartment when Dominic was away.  Having taken a greyhound bus departing quite late from NYC and arrived just too early in Montreal, I was just dying for an early check-in to lay my head down. Philip made my bed and gave me many suggestions about the city as he could, sorry Philip, I know I let you get tongue-tied many times;) Dominic was also very nice and responsive. He handed me complementary blankets just in case I might catch a cold at night. As to public transportation, it was  only 2 minutes walk to bus station 94/197, the former takes you to Station Frontenac on Green Line and the latter to Station Rosement on Orange (Website hidden by Airbnb) could always rely on STM to go to all the tourist sites, like the old port and Mont-Royal etc.There were also several grocery stores like IGA and restaurants and bars nearly.

The apartment is located in a very nice, tree-lined neighborhood with supermarkets, restaurants, a park, and other amenities nearby. The bus stop to connect you to the metro is only half a block away and the metro station is only about a ten-minute bus ride away. Once you hop onto the metro, the center of the city of Montreal is only about five stops away.\nThe apartment is very clean and simply decorated (if you are the \"Bells and Whistles\" type of person, you won't like it as much as I did). The room is a very nice sizable room with a big window. The only drawback is that the window opens to a Boulevard and there is no escaping the outside noise whether from street traffic passing through or otherwise (if you are a light sleeper, beware of that fact and be prepared to get awakened by noise in the early hours of the morning). \nThe host Dominic is very nice, very welcoming, easy going, hospitable beyond delight, and, above all, super accomodating. He gave me access  to everything in the kitchen, the livingroom, the back patio, and the bathroom. I really enjoyed my stay at Dominic's apartment and I highly recommend it to any travelers passing through Montreal (whether it's for a short stay  or a long haul)  DOMINIC  WAS  A  FANTASTIC  HOST..........!!!"},{"_id":"311598910","date":{"$date":"2018-08-21T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17892346","reviewer_id":"42188820","reviewer_name":"Nadine","comments":"dominicains nous a tr√®s bien accueilli, on se sent tr√®s vite √† l'aise comme a la maison.une adresse que je recommande.

To get downtown or Old Montreal you need to take a metro though or drive. It is listed as having parking, however, parking is in the back alley on the parking lot of a store above which the loft is located. To get to the car you have to go around the block. Upon our arrival we were greeted by the maid who was  unsure about the parking situation. It did get sorted out quickly enough. The loft has a nice rooftop patio but we weren't able to use it since there is a constant noise from the store's big AC units located right next to the patio. Also, in the bathroom we had 4 little bottles of body lotion and 5 little bottles of conditioner, but no shampoo or body wash - we had to get our own. The host was a bit slow to respond, I was using SMS so maybe it's a problem with the app. Overall, we had a pleasant stay (3 nights)."},{"_id":"162161295","date":{"$date":"2017-06-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17922322","reviewer_id":"12775618","reviewer_name":"Jared","comments":"The apartment was clean, accurate pics and a cute part of town.

It was clean, great location, FREE parking in the back (though the back is not easily accessible), the owner was very responsive, and the location was great.    A few things to mention would be that the bedrooms do not have doors so if you are needing privacy, you would have to be mindful of this.  Also,  the listing doesn't show the stairs leading from the main entrance.  What you see in the photos are the stairs in the rear that lead to the roof down below.  If you have difficulty climbing very steep stairs as we did (grandmother) then it's quite an inconvenience.  Though it would be fine otherwise.  \n\nI did like the fact that it's close to a \"Jean Cotou\" store so you can get all your toiletries there.  It's 1 min walking distance along with other little stores and restaurants.  If your a coffee drinker,  \"Caffelinni\" is 3 mins away walking which we enjoyed.  Free parking (in the back) was a huge plus since parking in Montreal can get pricy.    That alone adds a lot of value to the overall cost of the place.  We were able to Uber when needed and drive to other places if we wanted without having to worry about garage fees.  \n\nSo overall, we were more than satisfied with the place and thankful to the owners for letting us stay there."},{"_id":"204129840","date":{"$date":"2017-10-16T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17922322","reviewer_id":"52010728","reviewer_name":"Ebiere","comments":"This was my first Airbnb experience and it was great.

She was very pleasant and she said she would be in touch closer to check in. I didn't hear from her so I followed up two days before and she told me that she would share the key code with me the day before. I didn't hear from her with the code. I sent her a message early the morning of check in and did not hear back, then I continued to message as we got closer, but still nothing. I read in reviews that she had a furniture shop as shown in the pictures so when we arrived I went into the store but she wasn't there. Someone at the shop knew the code for the key so we were able to self check in. I sent Doris Mel another message to ask where to park and she replied and apologized for a problem with the Airbnb app. I never received any information from her about the apartment, the key code, wifi password, check out, so we guessed our way through. The apartment is very spacious and nice but it had some quirks. The street the flat is located on is a hodge podge mix of shops and feels more urban than the rest of the area. I love Jean Talon and Little Italy so I was happy to be so close and the parking was a bonus but that was a little bit awkward too."},{"_id":"214841302","date":{"$date":"2017-11-26T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17922322","reviewer_id":"18836752","reviewer_name":"Gabrielle","comments":"This is a modern luxurious flat just like the review claims.

Very clean. Spectacular neighbourhood, the strip was as if it was Christmas again. It was a bit difficult to find because the number isn‚Äôt visible on the front. Free parking but was hella hard to find it. The parking is located on the street prior to the actual street address.  Drove around atleast 3 times before we figured it out. At least 15-20 minutes away from downtown. If you have heavy suitcase or luggage, the stairs won‚Äôt be your best friend . You cannot, I repeat cannot enter from the back, so you have to park and walk around to the front. I would only suggest a mat at the front door for our shoes especially because it being winter, hand soap and hand towel to dry our hands would be nice.

It's a short walk to the metro and bus - there is a great little grocer a couple doors down and an excellent bodega selling regional craft beer. Plentiful restaurants a short walk or metro ride away.

The space looks exactly like the photos, and it‚Äôs a perfectly sized apartment in my opinion. There are a few great bars and restaurants within blocks. Bed was comfortable. \n\nThe main thing lacking was communication. The hosts never responded to my messages on Airbnb asking about check-in, all the way till the morning of our arrival. I texted both numbers listed in the House Manual and one of them finally answered hours before we got there. Doris was helpful and friendly over text but I wish there would‚Äôve been better communication from the beginning and throughout our stay. On our last day, I asked about the details of checking out (wanting to know if we had to do anything specific before we left), but I never got an answer, so we just kind of guessed.\n\nOther things to note: This is definitely more of a businesslike Airbnb, rather than someone‚Äôs actual home. I think they could use a fan in the bedroom. We weren‚Äôt sure if the towels or linens were 100% clean. The TV doesn‚Äôt have cable and you‚Äôd need to bring your own HDMI cord if you want to connect your computer to it. WiFi was good. Neighborhood is kind of a funny mish-mash of shops, but it has its charms.

We were not made aware that there were 2 lockboxes (1 for us, the other for the unit next door also rented out by the same host). We spent a lot of time trying to open up the wrong lockbox, as the other one was on a side wall which wasn't very noticeable (especially at night). Our calls/texts/messages to the host were not getting a response. The neighbors also came out to try and help us, and it took all 5 of us another 10 minutes of trying to reach the host before the neighbors noticed another lockbox on the side wall. This was the only time I've ever been frustrated with an Airbnb check in process.\n\nI'd still recommend this place, as it was very nice and reasonably priced.

Marina and Anuki were also very helpful for us to check in and out, and we were able to leave our luggage until late in the afternoon on our last. \r\nHowever, I cannot rate this place more than 2 stars, and here is why. When we got to the apartment, Anuki welcomed us and told us that she opened the window in the room because the heater was broken and we would be too warm to sleep. But when we went to bed, the noise from the street was too loud and we couldn't sleep, so we tried to close the window, and it turns out the window was broken too and could not be closed. So we basically slept in a hot and noisy room for 3 nights... Also, the oven isn't working in the kitchen and there is no microwave, which would have been nice to have instead of using the stove to warm our food up.\r\nHopefully, these will be fixed for the next people staying there...\r\nThank you both anyway, we still got to enjoy the Big Apple!"},{"_id":"12428616","date":{"$date":"2014-05-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"179428","reviewer_id":"7663259","reviewer_name":"B≈ôetislav","comments":"I stayed in the apartment for almost five weeks while visiting a university in NYC.

Both of them are very nice and thoughtful. They care about the place being clean, about being hospitable and making everything very clear and easy for you.\r\nI didn't see much of Anuki as she gets up early for work and I often got back late... as a tourist in Manhattan you definitely don't stay in all that much, but if you do, you're sure to feel at ease here.\r\nThe bathroom is absolutely fine, the kitchen too, everything is clean, and practical. The bedroom was a nice size and had storage to put your things away, a desk to sit at, a very comfortable bed, and in the daytime it gets the sun and you have a nice view over the street and a church.\r\nI got a little cold one evening when the temperature went down, but there were plenty of duvets and quilts to be cosy under.\r\nAnother minor glitch, I did have some work to do one evening and the wifi was not all that reactive. I actually had to abandon trying to send some files, the signal was just not strong enough.\r\nHowever if anything had been a real problem I'm 100% sure that Marina or Anuki would have found a solution, but I didn't actually get the chance to talk about it! Too busy running around New York and trying desperately to get as much input as possible :)\r\n\r\nI was visiting for just under a week and found Anuki's place to be practical for all the things I wanted to do and see. Very easy access to subway and possible to get down to Times Square in 20 minutes on lines 2/3. And when you've had too much of the action down in the south, it's nice to come back \"home\" and grab a bite at the Red Rooster or Amy Ruth's. I also tried and loved BLVD Bistro, not far at all. \r\nIf you're into gospel, this place is great for getting up on a Sunday morning and going to church, loads of choice.\r\nAlso a short walk to Central Park which I actually walked all the way through, down to the bottom, it was such a beautiful day.\r\nThank you Anuki and Marina for your welcome and for opening your home to us visitors :) \r\n"},{"_id":"54444448","date":{"$date":"2015-11-20T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"179428","reviewer_id":"5456442","reviewer_name":"Radek","comments":"I had a wonderful stay in Anuki and Marina's apartment, can highly recommend it!"},{"_id":"56396550","date":{"$date":"2015-12-13T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"179428","reviewer_id":"48370713","reviewer_name":"Jeffrey","comments":"Highly recommend the hosts Marina and Anuki who were 100% accommodating for arriving guests.

The apartment is convenient - one block from the 2 \u0026 3 subway, and four blocks from the 6. As a solo female I always felt safe in this lively East Harlem neighborhood. I often was coming home late - after 10 PM - and always felt safe walking from the train to the apartment. There was usually an open restaurant or food truck available for a late night meal. There's a very nice neighborhood coffee shop \u0026 restaurant across the street. The apartment is cozy; and as Marina stated. It faces the main street, which can get a little noisy, but wasn't that bothersome for me; If you're a very light sleeper, earplugs were provided. Whenever I asked for something - an extension cord, a lamp... Marina supplied it quickly. \r\n\r\nSince I stayed for 6 weeks, I took yoga classes one block away. I walked to the Apollo Theatre on a Saturday night; had dinner as a local restaurant, and did all my grocery shopping in the area.  It was great to have a laundry room in the building! There's no 'commom area,' in the apartment. There is a building yard, but I didn't have time to use it. Having a kitchen was a major pluse for me. Coffee in the AM, and the microwave for heating up food came in super handy.  A shared bathroom for three roomies, wasn't inconvenient, since I was on an early schedule. Bottom Line - Manhattan Cozy Room worked well for me! I'd recommend it!

The apartment was even more beautiful than the pictures.  This was a last minute (the night before) reservation and Diogo was fast and accurate with all communications.  We actually have never stayed at an Airbnb with a designation of  \"SuperHost.\"  We were spoiled and may never book another without the SuperHost label!  \n\nWe were greeted by the ever smiling Jose when we exited our taxi at the front door.  He helped us up to our amazing apartment and showed us around the place.  Everything from furnishings to the artwork on the walls was perfect.  The apartment is modern and has all the amenities you would ever need  for a 3 day weekend stay or longer!  \n\nThe view, the view, the view!   We sat on the balcony with the plate of Pastel de Nata and a bottle of Port, both graciously left as a welcome gift on the dining room table for us.  We ate the pasties and drank the wine while soaking in the amazing view!\n\nThe entire weekend was amazing!  Thank you Diogo and Jose for your hospitality and offering such a beautiful apartment to us!

Die Schlafzimmer sind sehr ger√§umig, die Innenausstattung der Wohnung sehr modern. K√ºche mit K√ºhlschrank und Herdplatte ist bei Bedarf vorhanden; nur Gew√ºrze, √ñl oder √§hnliches fehlte. \nGro√üer Pluspunkt ist die zentrale Lage (vielleicht 200 Meter zur Ponte Dom Luis). Man ist mittendrin, ohne direkt im touristischeren Get√ºmmel zu sein. Der Blick von den Balkonen aus (wir hatten die Wohnung in der obersten Etage) ist schlicht atemberaubend. Besser geht es wohl nicht.\nVis-a-vis f√ºhrt eine Treppe zu einschl√§gigen Kaffees und Restaurants. Ein Supermarkt ist leider nicht direkt um die Ecke. Ebenfalls hervorzuheben ist der kostenlose Parkplatz in einer ansonsten von Parkpl√§tzen nicht gesegneten Gegend. Der Parkplatz ist direkt sehr nah an der Wohnung und wir bewacht. Jose war ein wirklich gro√üartiger Gastgeber, der uns mit unserem Gep√§ck half und uns sogar ein paar Besichtigungs- und Restauranttipps gab. \nKleine Kritikpunkte (die wirklich haarspalterisch sind): Die Zimmer erm√∂glichen einen fantastischen Blick auf Porto, sind allerdings auch sehr laut. Die Stra√üe vor der Wohnung ist der einzige Anfahrtswerk zur Br√ºcke. Da die Scheiben/W√§nde eher schlecht isoliert sind, ist der Lkw- und Motorradl√§rm durchg√§ngig wahrnehmbar. Wer diesbez√ºglich empfindlich ist, k√∂nnte ggf. Probleme bekommen. Die vorliegenden Kissen sind etwas hart und eher f√ºr R√ºckenschl√§fer geeignet.\nAber das sind Kleinigkeiten: Alles in allem ist die Unterkunft sehr zu empfehlen.\n\nMuito Obrigado, Jose!\n"},{"_id":"306285017","date":{"$date":"2018-08-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17960308","reviewer_id":"178696084","reviewer_name":"P","comments":"Great place, great location, beautiful view.

If you‚Äôre going by car, you are able to park at the car park just a couple of minutes away (host gives you a card to have free access). There is no parking outside the property, so you won‚Äôt be able to unload there. One little thing that happened to us on last day was that the power went, but it was a matter of host pressing a button to have it working again.

It was also our first time using Airbnb and visiting a Hawaiian Island and we would definitely do it all over again. Early in our planning we intentionally made the decision to avoid the big resorts and seek out something that felt a little more like the \"real\" Hawaii. Eve's rustic cabin provided just that. The cabin was clean and comfy, with a great amount of lighting and windows. One of my favorite parts of the cabin was the large window high above the kitchen that looks into the jungle across the stream. It almost looks like a framed painting every morning when you wakeup.  The chirping birds in the jungle made it that much better. The property is close to Makawao and Pa'ia, both of which have great dinning and shopping and a great small town feel. We still visited the big resort towns for the beaches which weren't too far away. A baby beach protected by a reef is also just 10 min away! We found the cabin to be a great central location to see just about everything on the island. \n\nTip: We bought the book \"Maui Revealed\" before we made this trip and used it religiously the entire time we were there. Kula Bistro is a must, Makawao fresh morning doughnuts in the white building with green trim and usually a line (it's quick I promise!) 808 Cafe has great food and is across the street from our favorite beaches. Drive to Hana takes all day if you go all the way around, but is so very worth it. Get out and see everything! Bring food!\nThe Gingerbread Cottage is a perfect central location to everything on the island, but far enough from the hustle of the towns. Be sure to do the labyrinth walks on the property, it's a great way to prepare your mind to enjoy your vacation, also go sit by the river and read a bit, it's very relaxing. We will be back next year!!!"},{"_id":"15029968","date":{"$date":"2014-07-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1796816","reviewer_id":"6930819","reviewer_name":"Heidimarie","comments":"Steve met me when I arrived.

The location was secluded and romantic, but still within a short drive to many towns and more busy areas.  We felt at home right away.  The kitchen was stocked with all of the appliances we needed to cook meals, and shortly upon arrival Eve (our most gracious host) handed us a packet of recommendations and directions, as well as telling us where the nearest local market was.  We explored the whole island, and never felt like anything was too far since it was such a central point.  We definitely had to apply the bug repellant liberally, even when going to bed, but that is what happens when you stay in the forest!  Even though the property has other houses and a workplace on it- we never felt crowded or infringed upon.  Also- right now the property has liliko'i (passion fruit) blooming like crazy and we were able to gather and feast on it daily! The gardens attached to the property are also very beautiful and worth a look.  We were very sad to hear they were having a full moon walk on the eve of our departure!  All in all I would HIGHLY recommend staying at any one of the properties that Eve and Steve run, but we will definitely be returning to the Gingerbread house the next time we make it to Maui!!"},{"_id":"19412818","date":{"$date":"2014-09-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1796816","reviewer_id":"6717481","reviewer_name":"Tony","comments":"Eve was super helpful and suggested several locations to check out.

Moments later Steve popped in to introduce himself as well. The place was INCREDIBLE. A beautiful, upscale little cottage that looks like it was just built. It had a faint, refreshing smell of fresh cedar from the walls and was spotlessly clean. It was cozy and felt like we were staying in our own little home. Everything we needed was provided from extra towels, to bath products (in an awesome bathroom), to coffee and cookies to start our stay off deliciously.\r\n\r\nThe grounds of the property were epic and because of a recent rain the stream was in full force. We watched it flow over coffee every morning and picked a few tangerines from their tree for breakfast. In the afternoon we sat stream side and read for hours in what might be the most peaceful setting we've ever encountered. We also wandered their adjacent property, The Sacred Garden to take in the labyrinth and nursery as well as the organic farm.\r\n\r\nIt's a huge property that feels like you're secluded from the world yet it's only a few minutes drive to the quaint historic Makawao town with plenty of restaurants, or Paia, the coolest beach town on Maui with shops and some of the best dining on the island. It's also the beginning of the famed Road to Hana which is a must-drive while you're there.\r\n\r\nWe only saw Eve a few times during our 5 day stay but she checked in regularly via text to make sure we were happy. She stopped by just before we left to say goodbye and give us hugs. \r\n\r\nAs much as we loved the other places we stayed this is easily the best of the bunch. We plan to return again next year and hopefully make it an annual holiday trip to Maui. Highly recommend a stay here! \r\n\r\n"},{"_id":"25011342","date":{"$date":"2015-01-05T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1796816","reviewer_id":"9878086","reviewer_name":"Katie","comments":"Our stay at the Gingerbread House was amazing.  eve met us at the property and was very thorough on explaining everything.

Husband and I have been to Hawaii many times and wanted something different, away from the wall of condo buildings by the beaches. \r\n\r\nMakawao is a charming Upcountry town and the cottage at the Sacred Garden, a short drive away from town, was comfortable and quiet. It is very well appointed with cooking implements that allowed us to make breakfast every morning and dinner many nights. Large bathroom and good storage for our gear. The cottage is perfect for two people and perhaps a young child but any more would feel crowded. \r\n\r\nThe Hogans recently added wifi capabilities so you can check your email and post updates to make your (Hidden by Airbnb) friends envious of your visit. There is no television but a monitor with a DVD player for movies. Beautifully dark at night, we had spectacular star gazing every evening. We had not realized that there was a washing machine and dryer available to us -- a great surprise. \r\n\r\nEve welcomed us when we arrived in the evening and gave an overview of the grounds, what fruits were in season and ready to pick (tangarines and avos!) and offered any support we may need. Otherwise, we never saw her or Steve. There is a working nursery on the property and so a little bit of car traffic right by the cottage around 9 AM and 5 PM. By little bit, I am talking about three cars. \r\n\r\nOn Maui, you need to drive everywhere. The closest beach is in Paia, about 20 minutes away. Being in Upcountry, you are on your way up to Haleakala, a short drive from Kahului where you can get whatever provisions you need and we learned shortcuts to Kihei and the East Maui beaches. \r\n\r\nThe cottage (and the spirit of Jimi) was a memorable stay on Maui. If you are looking for the road less travelled plus want approving nods from the locals when asked about where you are staying, check out the gingerbread cottage. \r\n\r\n"},{"_id":"26207219","date":{"$date":"2015-02-07T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1796816","reviewer_id":"23945330","reviewer_name":"Evie","comments":"My husband and I had an AMAZING time, our only regret is that we didn't stay longer!

Be sure to check all the drawers and cabinets because we kept finding more and more goodies all over. The one thing worth mentioning is the hot water.

Its set in a tropical garden so we felt part of our surroundings, especially at night when we'd leave the windows open so we could wake up to all the natural sounds outside. The house came fully equipped with kitchen facilities so we could cook our own meals plus a good sized bathroom area. The host also left instructions which were helpful. A couple of minor things we would've liked - one was wifi in the room. Even though this was a minor issue, there were times when it was raining and we'd have to walk out to the gazebo to use the internet. Also, during out 4 day stay, because Eve and her partner were on holiday we didn't meet with anyone the whole time we were there. Even though we arrived late at night, we thought someone would've dropped by to introduce themselves some time during our stay. This wasn't a huge deal though as our overall stay was fantastic.

It is the perfect private retreat in the middle of Maui. Quiet, beautiful, and really feels like your own home. When we left, we were disappointed at the thought of someone staying in \"our house\"! Eve is one of the kindest ladies you could have the pleasure of meeting, and she went above any beyond to accommodate any of our needs. Beach towels in the house are a huge plus as you are in Maui, and any little thing you have don't have to pack is an advantage. Full sized working fridge and appliances, fresh bag of coffee, and fresh cookies were all there on our arrival. The dog on the property is a sweetie , and is a nice touch of pet therapy in a home away from home. The Sacred Garden on the property is breathtaking, and my husband and i loved the local advice given to us by Eve and some of her employees. Upon leaving we had forgotten a pretty expensive bluetooth speaker, and she was kind enough to text us and keep it in her home so we could retrieve it before catching our plane. The backyard is much more beautiful than the pictures, as they have added a patio and outdoor fireplace. We can't rave about this place enough, and are planning on coming back next summer with our children! You won't regret staying with on this property, and hope others will fall in love with it the same way we did!"},{"_id":"72923717","date":{"$date":"2016-05-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1796816","reviewer_id":"116921","reviewer_name":"Rosa","comments":"What a magical place!

My wife and I booked the week about 6 months in advance and were treated so well from day 1. Eve and Steve were wonderful hosts. Eve extended every courtesy from the week before our arrival to our final departure. The cabin was fully stocked with everything two honeymooners could want and the kitchen was well equipped for cooking light meals throughout the week. The back patio was perfect for reading and eating breakfast in the lush garden environment. There is even a small stream running through the back of the spacious property. The entire place is set up for serenity and privacy.  For those of you who care about such things, the shower was AMAZING and easily fits 2 people. Everything about the stay was serene, romantic, and deeply peaceful. My wife and I wanted to explore Maui a bit and Eve was very prepared to recommend restaurants, excursions, massages (she has a massage therapist on location), and she even set up a snorkling tour of Molokini for us. We loved every minute of our stay. During the snorkling trip I met her husband Steve, the captain of the boat. He is a master of scuba diving and provides dive tours around the island as well. He was very nice and easy to talk to. All in all, my wife and I couldn't have been happier. If you are a party of two without children, this is the place for you.

The gardens surrounding are gorgeous and the house itself is adorable, as stated in the description. \r\n\r\nCons: We realize that this is the jungle, however the listing said there would be Wi-Fi. Upon arrival, it was out and didn't start up until I had to find the router (next day), and reset it myself.\r\n\r\nThe biggest con, which actually caused my wife and I to leave a day early and go to a resort: CRITTERS! On our second night, we encountered two gecko lizards in the house as well as one of the largest spiders I have ever seen. Although gecko's inside a Hawaiian home are often considered good luck, I'm not sure we subscribe to that belief! \r\n\r\nIf little things like that send shivers down your spine, stay far away from this place.

The cottage is charming and Eve welcomed us warmly right away. The space had a variety of great conveniences (big fridge, microwave, coffee maker with yummy coffee provided.) The house was clean and well decorated. For a couple the bed was a good size, but not super supportive (if you need a firmer bed). Unfortunately, the week we were in Maui there was an excessive amount of rain resulting in a lot of mud on the property and a sort of constant dampness in the older cottage. The major problem was a lack of internet connection. There is a LINKSYS router in the cottage but it never had a reliable connection to the internet. I was able to load no more than a couple webpages at random in total. Troubleshooting/restarting the router didn't help. This was a pretty significant bummer when trying to plan your day before leaving the house since we also didn't have any cell coverage (AT\u0026T iPhone 7s). According to some previous reviews this is a persistent problem. You could find it on certain parts of the property, but rain \u0026 mud made that a bit tricky/inconvenient. Of course, we know no one can control the weather, but if we‚Äôre being honest, it put a damper on our stay here, leaving us with a fairly neutral experience. That being said, Eve herself was a lovely host offering tips, helping deliver a package we had to have sent to the house and allowing us to do laundry. If you‚Äôre looking to really ‚Äúget away from it all‚Äù the Gingerbread House is a great spot for you and it is conveniently located to the airport, Road to Hana, Paia, Upcountry and even the Wailea area.

It was perfect for us because we had already spent 10 days on the island and just wanted time to relax. The wifi wasn't the best but we didn't mind at all. It forced us to go outside and actually relax without the distraction of technology. She provides a DVD tv and DVDs for entertainment if needed. \nMy partner and I caught Eves full moon labyrinth session last night and it was really inspiring to hear her talk and to walk the labyrinth.

When we arrived, we were promptly greeted by Eve and one of the members of her cleaning staff. The property was ready right when we arrived. We talked with Eve and she showed us around the property. We quickly learned that what we read in the great reviews would be confirmed. She walked us around and showed us the fruit trees and said we were welcome to help ourselves to all of the fruit growing nearby. The tangerines were perfect and the lemons were HUGE (great for morning lemon water). The property includes a large house, the gingerbread house, Eve and Steve's house, and the Sacred Garden of Maliko (hope I'm spelling that correctly). Though there were other people renting the larger house next door and Eve and her husband were close by, we definitely felt that there was plenty of privacy. Eve was very clear that if we needed anything, we could contact her right away and she would respond, but that she wanted to give us our privacy otherwise. We did contact her a few times during our stay and she responded instantly. The gingerbread house is absolutely perfect for couples. It is very spacious on the inside and quite stylishly designed. The bed and sheets are totally comfortable and the bathroom has much more space than it appears from the online images. It is great that you can rent this property for less than a standard hotel room in Lahaina considering it is so much larger and more convenient. One item from the previous reviews that concerned us a little before we arrived was that the wifi did not work very well on the property. I will say that the first few days we were here, we could not get any wifi or data connection in the gingerbread house. I was able to walk a few steps to a small gazebo area, though, where the wifi was strong enough to send some emails. To ease future travelers' worries, I am pleased to report that in the middle of our stay, we received a message from Eve that the wifi in the gingerbread house had been fixed. When we returned, we found that the connection was lightning fast. We were able to easily use it for browsing and email and we even found that we could connect to netflix without any problems at all. The best part of staying on this property was the location. You can't possibly find a place to rent on Maui that is more central than this. It is definitely a bit further from Lahaina if you are more interested in hanging out at the beach every day (though Kihei is only about 20-30 minutes compared to Lahaina, which is more like 50-60), but everything else you would want to do on Maui is much closer to Makawao.

Because it's in the middle of a jungle there are wildlife which I think Eve mentions in the description, roosters crowing, little critters making noises and lots of birds and such. The hot water is a little short sided but that might depend on how many other occupants are on the property, the week we were there it was full.

Feels very secluded but is not far from town. Location was central to the many activities we planned that were spread out on the island. We had a moderate drive to most of our destinations. The perfect blend of convenience and solitude. \n\nI was travelling with my 12 year old son, but this would also be a nice choice for couples. Quiet, beautiful property, nice breezes,  the wonderful sound of rain on the tile roof, sounds of nature. The time we spent just lounging in our room was far more relaxing than a hotel room or condo could have been. \n\nFor me the lack of air conditioning was not ideal. Being from Texas I am accustomed to enduring much hotter temperatures than Maui also with very high humidity. But I am a person who likes my indoor climate cool and comfy. I do not put on a sweater or jacket at the hint of temps below 70 degrees. The indoors was certainly tolerable. I was never uncomfortable. Especially when I was able to open both doors for nice cross ventilation. But if there had been A/C I would have run it at times. If you prefer your space well conditioned this could be a consideration. \n\nOverall, wonderful trip, great property, and an accomodating host!"},{"_id":"174998162","date":{"$date":"2017-07-27T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1796816","reviewer_id":"11869863","reviewer_name":"Chris","comments":"Perfect place to get away and unwind.

Fiona was kind and very helpful, greeting us when we arrived and offering help and assistance when we needed it. The house is cute, we enjoyed how secluded it was and the pretty views out the windows. The property has a ton of fruit trees and chickens and roosters. We should note the roosters crow at any time day or night, but they were usually relatively quiet until dawn. I used ear plugs which helped. We also visited the Sacred Garden and enjoyed the peaceful greenhouse and walked the labyrinth. Truly a unique experience which added to our trip to Maui. Also note, the wifi is not very reliable and I would consider yourself unplugging for a few days while you are staying there.  We were there at a rainy part of the season as well and it rained a fair bit the whole three days of our stay.

The first part was our stay on the Hana side of Maui in the gingerbread house and the second part was on the resort side in Lahaina. Being on the Hana side of the island for a few days was breathtaking! It is so lush, green, and beautiful! \n\nThe Gingerbread house sits amongst the beautiful lushness of Maui's east side. It is secluded, and quiet. The property is on an acre or so of lush green gardens and we were even lucky enough to see the stream come in the back of the property! \n\nIf you want a place that is away from all of the tourists, is quiet, peaceful, and beautiful (think Jurassic Park lush green), than this place is it!\n\nThere are two things that are worth noting. 1. There are chickens and roosters on the property. Maui's east side is full of animal life, cows, horses, and chickens (you will find wild chickens everywhere). So this is to be expected and really does add to the ambiance of you being in the environment. We enjoyed it.\n2. There are two other homes on the property, but we never ran into anyone or were disturbed in any way by others. Again, this place is quiet and private, but you are not the only one on these couple acres.\n\nI thought those two things were worth mentioning. They are not downsides! Just information to help your decision, that's why you're reading this review isn't it?\n\nWe loved our stay here and would highly recommend it! Plus, Eve is excellent at communicating and so so hospitable! \nIt was a pleasure staying here!"},{"_id":"214736123","date":{"$date":"2017-11-26T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1796816","reviewer_id":"112032349","reviewer_name":"Briana","comments":"This was the cutest little place and on an amazing piece of land.

From the moment you step inside you immediately know that this is a very special place. Just outside the backdoor is a small patio area with table and chairs, and a free standing chiminea fire pit.\n    Outside you are surrounded by lush forest, plants and fruit trees. A stream flows through the property depending on the amount of rain received. It is is both peaceful and relaxing. Inside, a gentle breeze comes in through the windows throughout the day. On a cloud free and moonless night you can see lots of stars through a large picture window above the kitchen area. \n    One point of interest is a painting of Jimi Hendrix hanging in the bathroom. Rumor has it that he once stayed there while filming Rainbow Bridge. Ask Eve about that! There is no television but you won't miss it. It's a vacation after all. Everything else is there that you could possibly need. \n    Warning. There are a lot of roosters on the island (there seems to be three for every hen) and you will hear them crowing not just in the morning but also at night. The sound carries in a eerily way so if this is a deal breaker then you may want to stay in a hotel on another island. \n    Finally, this is our second stay here and we plan on coming again. You will find that Eve is a delightful host with a cheery smile! She greeted us with open arms and made us feel both welcome and at home.

We thoroughly enjoyed our first trip to up country rather than spend all our time as usual at busy beach resorts. What an eye opening experience of time to be spent on the island. Our choice to try One of Eve's cottages, in this case the Gingerbread House, was the highlite of our long trip. Her Photos and explanation of of the property were right on but being there yourself is something else! The peaceful surroundings, island feel, and beauty everywhere you look (or wonder) was really special. The location, next door to The Sacred Garden and short drive to the small local villages was an experience we WILL revisit and we WILL reach out to Eve for accomidation.

We were really surprised with the amenities that Eve made available in the house. From the beach chairs, games, goggles, towels to the toiletries it was the little things that made our stay welcoming. The lot is beautiful and the people are very friendly.  A couple of tips to make your stay even better are to bring ear plugs. The roosters are great but they crow very early in the morning. Use the mosquito repellent. No explanation needed. No AC unit so the house can get warm during the day. You can open the windows and use the fan but the house will still be warm. Other than that we enjoyed our stay and definitely recommend it."},{"_id":"315817641","date":{"$date":"2018-08-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1796816","reviewer_id":"1191289","reviewer_name":"Jordan","comments":"The minute you walk into the gated  property you are surrounded by beauty.  Eve took the time to sit down with Camelia and I and explain so many things about the island of Maui which was great for a couple first timers. Our cute little cabin withstood hurricane Lane so do fear that it doesn't have strong bones. Eve also runs a snorkeling/scuba trip which I would highly recommend. You get a great local feel vs. getting onto a large boat with 50 other tourists. The accommodations in the small cabin are endless. If you are looking for a more local upcountry feel and don't need to be next to a beach this is the place for you. The labyrinth is a great piece of art, there is endless amount of work done to it and is a very cool piece to an already beautiful area. I cant enough about how wonderful our trip was to the cabin.

We wanted a relaxed environment, a chance to meet locals, and see the island.  So as we made our way from the big city airport, up roads that became more rural, with vegetation growing right up to the edge of the road, we knew we'd made the right decision.  And then you see the cottage; it is every bit adorable as you see in the photos.  The fainting couch is the best seat to view the monkey pod tree from the very large window.  We ate most meals out but we made coffee and had cereal at the cottage.  There are two grocery stores in Makawao and Haiku, two very close towns. You must walk the grounds to appreciate life in a rain forest:  bananas, pomegranates, coffee beans, and I think other fruits are growing within 50' of the cottage door.  The trickling stream came alive one night from a tropical storm that flooded parts of the beach areas but at 1000', didn't bother us; we were still acclimating to the time change so it just made for good sleeping.  We were very grateful for Steve's two minute Hawaiian language course.  Between the land and the language, you really know you're someplace else.  We had a car so getting around the island from Makawao was really easy.  \nIt's all true about the tropical climate (that things don't dry well) so get yourself some breathable tropical clothing.  People there mostly wear bathing suits/coverups anyway.\nIt's also true that the chickens are wild and everywhere on the island (except the volcano).  They're just like squirrels where we come from except some of them crow and not just at sunrise.  But we loved our chicken family and I swear we saw the three baby chicks grow in the week we were there.  They're not afraid of humans and were like a welcoming committee.  \nMaui, Makawao, this cottage - it was all perfect for us.  My favorite bumper sticker said, \"Slow down.  It's not the mainland\".  Maui's really laid back so come to this cottage and relax.  Mahalo, Eve \u0026 Steve!"},{"_id":"333888118","date":{"$date":"2018-10-07T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1796816","reviewer_id":"130165342","reviewer_name":"Jodi","comments":"The Gingerbread House is truly a delight.

It was extremely clean and had almost everything we needed. the bed was super comfortable and we had access to a washing machine and dryer every single day at no additional charge. Eve was even kind enough to leave Tide Pods for us to do our laundry. The bathroom was super roomy and we had plenty of storage space for our belongings. There were plenty of pots pans dishes and goodies for us when we got there. I thought it was very kind that they left Maui macadamia nut cookies and Maui coffee for us at no additional charge because hotels would charge you an arm and a leg for those additional amenities. we were also provided with boogie boards and yoga mats as well as a beach umbrella which was awesome because many resorts or hotels charge fees for those things and we thought it was really cool that Eve provided it with no additional charge. the property is nice because we truly felt like we were living like the locals but because of our location we were still close enough to enjoy all of the touristy Maui activities without having to travel too far. The gingerbread Cottage is literally like living in a jungle and the property is just gorgeous. there are mosquitoes and cane spiders ( which are huge) but we never saw a spider in our room and as long as we remembered to put bug spray on we never dealt with any mosquito problems. whenever we needed anything from toilet paper to ear earplugs to printed out boarding passes for a boat that we signed up to go for a sail on, eve was right there..... always responding within minutes of us reaching out to her and always helping us out within the hour. She was truly a very attentive host. She also has the sweetest golden retriever puppy we really enjoyed loving on and a secret garden that's open to the public that my husband and I really enjoyed visiting which is a must see when you're there. there are only a few things worth mentioning that might be bothersome for some people depending on what you expect out of the accommodations and I will mention those here. first thing is the shower. Everything on Maui is expensive so everyone has energy-efficient everything. Therefore, the shower only heats up for a couple of minutes. Eve says in her welcome book that the hot water lasts for 6 minutes but it feels a little shorter than that. she also says it only takes 10 minutes to heat up again after it gets cold but that's not true either. It takes a lot longer than 10 minutes to heat up again. So if you're the type of person that wants to take a nice long hot shower or if you're a couple and you guys want to shower immediately after each other, thats not going to happen at this Cottage. If my husband and I didn't take a shower together, we had to put aside about an extra hour or hour and a half so we could both have hot showers before we headed out. next, We were on our honeymoon so we didn't need a TV. But we were informed there was a TV and while there was no cable there was a DVD player so we thought we could watch our movies. but when we got there, there was no TV or DVD player in the room. so there is NO tv whatsoever. people should also know that there is no air conditioning and while Makawao is usually 10 degrees cooler than the outer parts of the island because it's UpCountry, there were still nights that I woke up in a sweat because I was hot. We weren't miserable or anything but there were definitely some days that especially when trying to sleep it would have been nice to have access to air conditioning and not just a stand-up fan. the only other thing that might drive people a little nuts is the Roosters. Wherever you go on the island of Maui there are wild chickens and roosters everywhere. So there's tons of these feathery guys on Eves property as they are a farm. we truly loved our feathery friends and we truly felt we bonded with them and they really didn't bother us initially..... but after about day 6 or 7 of waking up to our favorite rooster doing his morning rooster call at 4 a.m. we we're starting to get a little Punchy because we were losing sleep. So we had to reach out to Eve and she was kind enough to give us earplugs which helped me a lot but didn't really help my husband. so anyone that would have a problem with a rooster call at 4 am, you should reach out to eve before you get there and let her know that you want her to lure those chickens and roosters to another part of the property before you get there. also it's a little hard to get a decent Wi-Fi signal out there. like I said, we were on our honeymoon so the things I mentioned in here were very minor for us and didnt bother us at all really.... but depending on what you're hoping to get out of your stay we thought we should mention them because technology and basic things like long hot showers are taken for granted and people may not realize how important it is to them until they don't have access to it. We really like to be detached from everyone and everything and we don't like to be doted on and we aren't Resort people, so the things I mentioned were fine for us but for people that are typically Resort people, it may be quite the adjustment. personally, we absolutely loved our stay and we're talking about trying..."},{"_id":"344120275","date":{"$date":"2018-11-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1796816","reviewer_id":"55723386","reviewer_name":"Sally","comments":"Eve‚Äôs cottage is great if you  are looking for a peaceful place to stay in Maui.

They kept us on a great schedule for the week, especially since the sun goes down early in Maui. Eve added extra touches, such as coffee, cookies, beach towels, and bug spray, which were all very much appreciated and used.

Because It wasn't only a great apartment that made my boyfriend and I have a great time in Rio but Sergio as a host certainly made the difference. What a sweet, smart and friendly guy. Sergio is a retired doctor that opens his house for the pleasure and fun of having nice people around to share experiences. He's a very wise man and we felt like visiting family. Sergio' studio was just great! Very spacious, nicely decorated and cozy. A fantastic bedroom with terrace, a small salon with couch, dinning table, TV, private bathroom and kitchen. The whole studio is very bright and we heard birds singing every single day. The view to the Pavao Pavaozinho Favela is also very pretty and interesting specially If you have never had a contact or seen a Favela before. During the night with all the lights is just gorgeous. The studio was always tidy and clean. Bed sheets and towels were often changed by his staff. Sergio always put some nice and fresh fruits on the table, some goodies in the fridge, chocolates, the cabinets have more than just necessary things. Everything we needed for coffee and thee and even some cookies we found there  as a courtesy, just for Sergio's pleasure of making our stay the best experience possible. We stayed for 2 weeks and he helped us from our laundry till the best tips on where to eat or have fun for a good price. The building is very well located near Posto 5 in Copacabana and Its a short walking distance to Ipanema (only 10 minutes).Taxi cabs are very cheap as well compared to European cabs so we easily took a cab at the building's entrance to Gavea, Lagoa, Favala do Vidigal for 10-20 reais only (5 euros). The access to metro station is even a better and a cheap way to go places, only 3 minutes walk from the building, tickets cost 3,60 reais (1,20 euros) per trip and we visited Botafogo, Flamengo, Lapa, City Center and Maracana Stadium taking the metro. Much easier, faster and cheaper. We took buses as well to a few places such as Barra da Tijuca, Sugar Loaf and city center and It's only 3 reais (1euro) per trip. Public transportation in Rio is extremely cheap and take you everywhere. Copacabana beach is 5 minutes walk. Sa Ferreira street is beautiful with  lots of green and it is a safe area. Sergio is extremelly friendly, warm and he really puts some effort to take care of the guests as much as he can. He was always there for a nice conversation but at the same time respecting our privacy. There were always a nice flower in the bedroom, delicious fruits and some drinks. My boyfriend and I enjoyed our stay in this lovely and cute studio a lot and we just can't wait to go back to see Sergio again and have a great time in Rio!"},{"_id":"12242257","date":{"$date":"2014-04-27T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1797689","reviewer_id":"7421520","reviewer_name":"Tys","comments":"Sergio is the perfect host for his guests: very friendly and hospitable.

The studio itself is a little paradise in the heart of busy Copacabana. It is located around five minutes walk from Copacabana beach and ten minutes to Ipanema. There are lots of shops, restaurants, juice bars around - you will find everything you need within just a couple of minutes. The studio itself is spacious and simply stunning. There is a terrace attached to it and the bedroom has aircon and a private bathroom. It is very clean, safe and homy. Sergio spoiled us by providing fresh fruit, yoghurt and coffee each day and he gave us chocolate treats each night too - pure bliss. There is no better place I could imagine to stay at in Rio and if we come back (which we will for sure) we will definitely stay with Sergio again.

He definitely made us feel at home in his lovely apartment, and we are very thankful to Sergio, for making our time in Rio so lovely and easy! \n\nThe apartment itself also could not have been more perfect! The location is excellent. It is safe, very close to the metro, very close to both Copacabana and Ipanema beaches, as well as close to many lovely restaurants. \n\nThe apartment is great because you have your own space- a nice bedroom, a bathroom, a separate lounge and kitchen/dining area, and a lovely courtyard. It is an excellent space for relaxing. \n\nI definitely will be recommending Sergio's apartment to anyone I know who is heading to Rio de Janeiro.

From the minute we booked the reservation, he responded promptly and accepted our request.  He provided very detailed information and directions to his apartment in Copacabana.  We found the apartment without any problem. Upon arrival, he accommodated us with an early check in.  He stocked the fridge with beer, soda, water and several fresh fruits and snacks.  He placed chocolates near our bed! I cannot say enough about how kind and considerate he is.  He thought of everything.  He even gave us a farewell gift!\r\n\r\nThe location is very centrally located.  The metro is only a block away with quick access to other parts of the city.  The metro is really the way to go to venture to different neighborhoods in Rio and is very safe and efficient to use.  You will save a ton of money on cab fare!  If you feel like walking, Copacabana beach is about 3 blocks away and Ipanema is about 8-10 minutes walk.  There are fabulous restaurants within walking distance from his apartment.  It is also located near a grocery store if you need to get some provisions.  \r\n\r\nThe room feels like its own apartment.  You enter the apartment through a common area, but you have the upstairs all to your self.  There is a living room, bedroom, bathroom, kitchenette, and terrace all just for you!  It is very relaxing just to sit on the rooftop and drink a beer or glass of wine.  The bedroom has a ceiling fan and air conditioner just in case it gets too warm.  The apartment is extremely clean.  \r\n\r\nThe neighborhood is lively.  Music can heard until the early morning sometimes and there is a lot of construction going on in Rio at this time.  That can be a drawback if you are looking for peace and quiet.  After all, this is a very bustling city!  \r\n\r\nSergio called us a cab to the airport which was much cheaper than what we would have paid if we called one ourselves.  \r\n\r\nSergio, thank you so much for a memorable stay in Rio.  Thank you for all the helpful information you provided.  We were able to navigate the city quite well with your help.  I hope we meet again someday.  Please call us if you every find yourself in California!\r\n\r\nMost Sincerely, Grace."},{"_id":"46128639","date":{"$date":"2015-09-08T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1797689","reviewer_id":"35880031","reviewer_name":"Karine","comments":"A melhor op√ß√£o que poder√≠amos ter escolhido para nossa hospedagem no Rio de Janeiro!

One Sunday we were at the apartment and Sergio invited us to join him and his family for Sunday lunch, which was very nice of him. \r\n\r\nThe apartment is spacious and clean and it is very well located.

His knowledge of Rio is extensive and he was instrumental in us finding great places to eat, and fully understanding the easiest ways to navigate to and from  our venues and excursions.\n\nSergio even stayed up until 2 am with us to ensure we had a taxi ready for pickup.

It worked out fine for our group of 6, but might not have worked out as well if everyone was going to share the bathroom.  We needed a second set of keys and she was able to arrange for someone to drop them off. Although we never got to meet ÊñáÊñá, she was always within reach via (Hidden by Airbnb) . Every time I had a question/concern whether before or during the trip, I was able to get a response soon.  The apartment looks just as it does in the pictures.  The air conditioner in one of the bedrooms can be a bit loud, but being we were exhausted from our days out, it was not a problem.  The kitchen light was dim and a little dirty but there was no need for us to cook since we ate out every meal. Very central apartment, without being on a loud and crowded street.  A couple minutes walk to Temple St, Ladies Market, convenience stores, etc. The plus being right across the street from the Yau Ma Tei station exit B.

This area of the Big Island is lush and tropical and with that beauty comes an abundance of life, so attention must be taken when preparing or storing any kind of food, as the ants will be quick to make an appearance.

Rev Les was a sweetheart from start to finish and his furry hosts as well as the people working on the farm were very kind and fun to chat with as well.  Honey Girl (the golden) was a sweet greeter, but also so well trained that she wouldn't come inside.  So you can have all the pup you want.\n\nFor the price, you kind of wonder what you're getting.  The place was immaculate, tastefully decorated and made it easy to relax and enjoy the place.  Its an amazing value and more that I could have expected.  \n\nThere is construction and farming going on so its not like the Disneylandia properties of some resorts.  Its got natural beauty of a farm with ocean views, big sky \u0026 bright stars and really quiet at night.  \n\nLes's place a good home base for exploring northern and mid island.  We only stayed two nights as we stayed at several places around the island.  Wish we had stayed another night.\n\nThe host was also very generous with products grown on the farm.  Mahalo nui loa Rev Les!  We'll be back and be sure to recommend.  Your place was a great place to relax and recharge.  Our hearts are happier having stayed with you.

It is at a good location between MTR, multiple convenient store located surrounding it and flea market not far from it. The self laundry locates at L1 is also a convenience for those who wants to do their laundry like me. \n\nCONS: The place can barely fit 2 pax let alone with luggage. I've struggle within the small space to access my luggage and at the same time giving my partner her own space. 1 pax would be just nice for the room instead, my point of view. \n\nDue to the nature of the small size room, you won't feel comfortable lying in bed/hanging out in the room for 1/2 day just to rest/chill. Instead over time you will slowly develop claustrophobia.  (true story). \n\nThe only ventilation of the room is a 2 x A4 size window and a aircon. Most of the time you will be using aircon and there isn't any air/wind from the window in which your skin will be very dry over time. \n\nOverall the place is decent if you want to just sleep and move on to the next activities next day and repeat, otherwise it will be just mehhh. 1 pax is recommended per room instead of 2."},{"_id":"309928715","date":{"$date":"2018-08-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18004323","reviewer_id":"143278232","reviewer_name":"Wing John","comments":"ËøòË°å,ËêΩ‰∏™ËÑö"},{"_id":"313179433","date":{"$date":"2018-08-25T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18004323","reviewer_id":"205260025","reviewer_name":"Shaaaaaaay","comments":"ËõÆÈÄÇÂêàËøáÂéªÊ∏∏Áé©ÁöÑ‰ΩèÂÆøÂú∞ÁÇπ,Á¶ªÊó∫ËßíÂú∞ÈìÅÁ´ôÂæàËøë,ÊàøÈó¥Â§ßÂ∞èÁöÑËØùÊàëÂíåÊúãÂèã‰∏§‰∏™Â•≥Áîü‰ΩèÂàöÂàöÂ•Ω,Á©∫Èó¥ÊúâÁÇπÂ∞è,Ë°åÊùéÁÆ±ÁöÑËØù‰∏ÄÊ¨°Âè™ËÉΩÊâìÂºÄ‰∏Ä‰∏™,Êàø‰∏úÂõûÂ§çÊ∂àÊÅØÂæàÂèäÊó∂,ÊÄª‰πãÊòØ‰∏ÄÊ¨°‰∏çÈîôÁöÑ‰ΩèÂÆø‰ΩìÈ™å"},{"_id":"316281461","date":{"$date":"2018-08-31T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18004323","reviewer_id":"202373539","reviewer_name":"Âì≤ÂÆá","comments":"Á©∫Èó¥ËôΩÁÑ∂Â∞è,‰ΩÜËøô‰∏™‰ª∑Ê†ºÂú®ÂêÑÊñπÈù¢ÈÉΩÂæà‰∏çÈîô‰∫Ü,‰∫§ÈÄö‰æøÂà©,ÈôÑËøëÊúâË∂ÖÂ∏Ç,ÂæàÊôö‰πüËÉΩÊâæÂà∞ÂêÉÁöÑÔΩ°ÂÖ•‰ΩèÊúâ‰∏™Â∞èÈóÆÈ¢òÁ¨¨‰∫åÂ§©Êàø‰∏úÈ©¨‰∏äÂ∞±Ëß£ÂÜ≥‰∫ÜÔΩ°"},{"_id":"320043380","date":{"$date":"2018-09-08T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18004323","reviewer_id":"51858055","reviewer_name":"Xinglan","comments":"‰ΩçÁΩÆÂæàÂ•ΩÊâæ!‰πüÂæàÊñπ‰æø,ÊÄß‰ª∑ÊØîÂæàÈ´ò!"},{"_id":"320482945","date":{"$date":"2018-09-09T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18004323","reviewer_id":"143239702","reviewer_name":"Amway","comments":"Â∞è"},{"_id":"322356810","date":{"$date":"2018-09-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18004323","reviewer_id":"214592318","reviewer_name":"ÂòªÂòª","comments":"‰ΩçÁΩÆÂæàÂ•ΩÊâæ,ÂÆö‰ΩçÈáëËº™Â§ßÂªàÂ∞±ÂèØ‰ª•ÊâæÂà∞ÔΩ°ÊàøÈñìÂæàËø∑‰Ω†,Áù°ËëóÂæàÊúâÂÆâÂÖ®ÊÑüÔΩ°ÊØîÈ†êÊÉ≥‰∏≠ÁöÑÂñúÊ≠°ÔΩ§ËàíÊúçÔΩ§‰πæÊ∑®ÔΩ°ÁÜ±Ê∞¥‰πü‰æÜÂæóÂæàÂø´ÔΩ°"},{"_id":"326272951","date":{"$date":"2018-09-22T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18004323","reviewer_id":"214031887","reviewer_name":"Êª¢","comments":"ËÆ∞ÂæóÂ∏¶ÁâôÂà∑"},{"_id":"336122409","date":{"$date":"2018-10-14T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18004323","reviewer_id":"194615086","reviewer_name":"Alisa","comments":"‰ΩçÁΩÆÊå∫Â•ΩÊâæÁöÑÔΩ°Â∞±ÊòØÊàøÈó¥Â§™Â∞è,‰ΩÜÊòØÂæàÂπ≤ÂáÄÔΩ°ÈúÄË¶ÅÊ∑ª‰ª∂Ë¢´Â≠ê,Êàø‰∏ú‰πüËÉΩÂèäÊó∂ÂõûÂ§çÔΩ°Âë®ËæπÂ∞èÂêÉ,ÈÄõË°óÊ≠•Ë°å‰∏™ÂçÅÂàÜÈíüÂ∞±Âà∞‰∫ÜÔΩ°ÂØπÈù¢È©¨Ë∑ØÂ∞±ÊúâÂçéÊòüÂÜ∞ÂÆ§!ËÄå‰∏îÁ¶ªÊàëÊâìÈíàÁöÑÂú∞Êñπ‰πüÈùûÂ∏∏Ëøë"},{"_id":"338614353","date":{"$date":"2018-10-20T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18004323","reviewer_id":"160144876","reviewer_name":"‰Ω≥ÊÖß","comments":"Ëá™Âä©ÂÖ•‰Ωè Âπ≤ÂáÄ ‰∫§ÈÄöÊñπ‰æø ÊÄß‰ª∑ÊØîÈùûÂ∏∏È´ò"},{"_id":"341090076","date":{"$date":"2018-10-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18004323","reviewer_id":"218221300","reviewer_name":"Èõã","comments":"ÊàøÈñìÂü∫Êú¨‰∏äÂ∞±ÊòØ‰∏ÄÂºµËºÉÂ∞èÁöÑÈõô‰∫∫Â∫äÂíåÂ∞èÂ∞èÁöÑÊµ¥ÂÆ§,Â¶ÇÊûúÊúâÂÖ©ÂÄãÂ§ßË°åÊùéÁÆ±ÂèØËÉΩÊúÉÊúâÈªûÊì†ÔΩ°Âè¶Â§ñË¢´Â≠êÁúüÁöÑÊúâÈªûÂ∞èÔΩ°Âú®Êó∫ËßíÈùûÂ∏∏Êñπ‰æøÔΩ°"},{"_id":"341858210","date":{"$date":"2018-10-28T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18004323","reviewer_id":"45509178","reviewer_name":"Âá§Ê∏Ö","comments":"ÊàøÈó¥Êï¥‰ΩìËøò‰∏çÈîô ÊèíÂ§¥ÊØîËæÉÂ∞ë ÊäΩÂ±âÈáåÊúâ‰∏™ÊèíÂ∫ßËøò‰∏çÈîô Âç´ÁîüÈó¥ÊúâÁÇπÂ§™Â∞è‰∫Ü È©¨Ê°∂ÂíåÊ∑ãÊµ¥Ê≤°ÊúâÈó¥Èöî Ê¥ó‰∏™Êæ°Â∞±ÁâπÂà´Êπø ËøòÊúâÂûÉÂúæÊ°∂Âú®Âç´ÁîüÈó¥Â§ñÈù¢‰∏çÂ§™Êñπ‰æø Â∫äËøòÊå∫ËàíÊúçÁöÑ"},{"_id":"344560494","date":{"$date":"2018-11-04T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18004323","reviewer_id":"26025145","reviewer_name":"Joyce","comments":"Â†¥ÊâÄ‰æøÂà©„Å™ÔæéÔæÉÔæô„Åß„Åô"},{"_id":"415576425","date":{"$date":"2019-02-23T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18004323","reviewer_id":"95971273","reviewer_name":"ËØóÊïè","comments":"Âú∞ÁêÜ‰ΩçÁΩÆÂæà‰æøÊç∑\nÂú®ÂØ∏ÂúüÂØ∏ÈáëÁöÑÊó∫Ëßí ÊàøÈó¥ÁúüÁöÑÂæàÂ∞èÂï¶"}]}

This was disappointing for us as we had specifically chosen this location because of reviews saying otherwise.\n\nThe wifi does not work at all in the room. If you want any internet you need to go to the kitchen.\n\nThe room can get really HOT, so this was an issue for us as we had some very high temperatures during our stay.\n\nThere were a few people I interacted with. Helmut was not actually our host and it was Gerard who stays in the apartment. I had been asked to contact someone called Abdul before my arrival, which I did, but I never saw this person.

You can go to the weekly farmers market which is across the street every Saturday morning and then go on a morning hike, play tennis, basketball or soccer before finally laying out to work on your tan. Later you can watch the sunset over the Hudson River or perhaps go on a sunset hike. It really is nice up here!

Natalia of course was nice enough to let me stay at her place, and arranged a really close place to the Port Authority to pick up the keys to the place, which really helped me out.  I was quite happy with where her place was located, especially since it was in a spanish neighborhood and I love authentic spanish food.  Her cat was a good friend to me and enjoyed all the attention I gave her, as well as the company to.  Natalia also left me a list of local restaurants and where they were located, as well as where local grocery stores were which was a big help being from out of town.   I would highly recommend her place to anyone else looking for a place to stay in New York.  I will happily stay here again next time im in New York if her place is available to stay at.  The place looks exactly like the pictures she has taken and posted, but even roomier and tons of light and fresh air come in at all times of the day, and you also get a nice view of the local neighborhood you are staying in.

No, the car horn is everywhere to be heard all over this town. \r\nAnyway they did tone it down later in the evening. \r\n\r\nNatalia's cat Emilia is a very considerate roommate--she does not romp around the room, pester for food, beg to be let out (she's an indoor cat), or have any disagreeable aspects to her personality, which is friendly.  For a cat owner, you will appreciate this, and if you are new to cats, don't worry. \r\nThis cat is a class act. \r\nAs far as trying to rate the neighborhood goes, with a 5 being a Park Ave. address, or a nice tree-lined street in the Village, etc., near a station, it isn't that, but it doesn't cost 300 per night either. I don't want to be around that type of alien situation, anyway, so I'm not rating by numbers on that. It is not only by one station that has express service, but another subway line is nearby and across the street is a coffee shop that offers varietal coffees--they list it as \"pour over\" on the menu as opposed to the house coffee and espresso drinks, made by the cup in one of those glass coffee pots. You will taste the \"notes\" of various berries and fruits, as you do with varietal wines over on the East Side, with these different coffees. I could go on further with this. \r\n\r\nAll in all, we left feeling happy and well taken care of. We were so busy, we didn't get around to picking her brains about going thrifting and getting deals on things around town, but maybe next time...\r\nThank you, Natalia!\r\n"},{"_id":"2565667","date":{"$date":"2012-10-09T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"180653","reviewer_id":"11338261","reviewer_name":"David","comments":"Natalia was great at communicating with me ...

Natalia was very accommodating and told us to help ourselves to anything in the kitchen.  The cat, Emilia, was a delight - friendly and quirky.   The bed is comfortable.  Natalia has Direct TV, HBO, and an extensive collection of movies.   Cons:  It would be nice to have a sofa to sit on; one has to sit on the bed to watch TV or read.  This is a pre-war building; the radiator heat cannot be adjusted, and it was very hot in the evening.  We had to open the window and use the fan to keep it from being too hot.  This seems like a waste of energy, but this seems to be the way it is in any of the pre-war buildings in NYC."},{"_id":"3215835","date":{"$date":"2013-01-02T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"180653","reviewer_id":"1662899","reviewer_name":"Tom","comments":"Natalia's place was great!

I would definitely recommend  her place if you set a high value on a clean, big and tidy room in a cool area. Admittedly it takes a while to get to downtown NYC, but it is worth the ride. In case you are concerned about feeding the cat, please don't worry about it. You feed the cat in the AM and in the PM. The cat food is of course provided by Natalia. The turtle doesn't need to be fed, since it has all been taken care of by Natalia before your arrival.

Moreover, Manhattan was just one train ride away.\r\n\r\nLastly, the cat, Emelia is very quite and docile.

I even got my hand henna.designed in a small storefront operated by a woman from India. The hood is super safe. \r\n\r\nNatalia is a great host. A couple of things you may want to know is that the apt is not a one bedroom but has one big room plus kitchen and bathroom. There is no place to unpack.

It's a half hour ride on the express, so you have time to read your guidebook or observe the local New Yorkers on the train. We would absolutely recommend this apartment if you don't have to live on Time Square, the subway service is frequent and can be found almost anywhere you go.

The host was very easy to work with as far as being able to check in early and check out late, which was very appreciated considering we had two babies with us.  The only downside was that there was no AC. Given, it was my fault for not checking the listing, and although I thought we wouldn't survive a night there, you felt a nice cool breeze when you opened both front and back doors so the AC wasn't needed after all.  (One of the neighbors came to yell at me because one of the babies was crying so I had to keep the door shut) The location was perfect! It was walking distance to the very popular breakfast spot \"The Gazebo\" and to the Napili Bay that is very beautiful and you can see turtles.  There were a couple of issues with roaches, but it's inevitable considering they are condos and not everyone that lives in a complex is clean, although the condo was.

The kitchen is modern and well-designed, and is fully-supplied with equipment, utensils, crockery, cutlery, tea and coffee, spices, etc. The bathroom is unrenovated but the shower is hot with good pressure, and the space works well. The bed was comfortable.\n\nThis top-floor apartment is not overlooked, and has a pleasant urban outlook. The location is supremely convenient to Uni of Sydney, and just far enough from Parramatta Road that noise is not a problem. There are frequent buses nearby, on several routes. Next time I won't bring a car. There are only a few on-site parking spaces, and when these are taken or reserved you may need to park some distance away if you need unrestricted parking."},{"_id":"241151768","date":{"$date":"2018-03-08T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18082902","reviewer_id":"165114565","reviewer_name":"Á∫¢","comments":"ËøòË°åÂêßÔΩ°ÁΩëÁªú‰∏çÂ§üÁ®≥ÂÆö,Ââç‰∏§Â§©ÈÉΩÊ≤°Âèë‰∏äÁΩëÔΩ°Êµ¥ÂÆ§ÈæôÂ§¥ÊºèÊ∞¥,Êúâ‰∫õÂΩ±Âìç‰ºëÊÅØ,ÂÖ∂‰ªñÈÉΩËøòÂ•ΩÔΩ°"},{"_id":"243416932","date":{"$date":"2018-03-16T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"18082902","reviewer_id":"11527847","reviewer_name":"Glenda","comments":"Enjoyed my stay - good neighbourhood and very walkable for groceries, coffee, laundry, and transit.
