It is renowned for the fact that it has always managed to maintain an independent character from the rest of the city. The neighbourhood is richly cultural, from the diversity of people walking its streets to street parties, human towers, live music and fireworks, a wide variety of restaurants, and cinemas, theatres and galleries. The unique architecture also adds a charm of its own. The narrow streets, little squares and small buildings are reminiscent of the town it used to be, but the spectrum of restaurants, bars, shops and cinemas betray its status as a part of Barcelona, Catalunya’s capital city. Gracia offers the choice of quiet sleepy side streets alongside the life and bustle of its squares.","notes":"Prices are VAT included.

Sie bot uns jedoch eine andere (größere) zum selben Preis an, bei der es sich allerdings nicht um die hier bewertete, sondern um die der Anzeige 'Lovely 2 BD Wifi Gracia' handelte. An unserem Ankunftstag hatte unser Flug zwei Stunden Verspätung, was leider zu einigen Komplikationen bzgl. des Check-In führte und nur durch eine vor Ort wohnende Freundin gelöst werden konnte.\r\n\r\nDie o.g. Wohnung selbst befand sich mitten in Gracia, wobei es sich unserer Meinung nach um einen der schönsten und lebendigsten Stadtteile Barcelonas handelt. Es befanden sich diverse kleine Geschäfte und Restaurants in der Nähe und auch zwei Metro-Stationen waren fußläufig in 5-10min zu erreichen.\r\nLeider fühlten wir uns in der Wohnung nicht so wohl, da in den gesamten Räumen ein muffiger Geruch hing. Hinzu kam, dass es im Badezimmer insbesondere morgens und abends erheblich nach Abfluss stank (vermutlich aus dem Abzugsrohr)! Da die Klimaanlage nicht funktionierte und ein Lüften bei unserer Abwesenheit nur auf Kipp möglich war (Erdgeschosswohnung), ließ sich dieser Geruch überhaupt nicht vertreiben. Aber auch bei weit geöffnetem Fenster trat keine Besserung ein. Nach Kontaktaufnahme zu Silvia erschien sie jedoch sofort am nächsten Tag und versuchte, dieses Problem zu lösen, was jedoch während unseres Aufenthalts nicht mehr möglich war. Allerdings brachte sie uns nach unserem Hinweis einen neuen Duschvorhang mit, da der alte gammelig war und wahrscheinlich bereits sehr lange dort hing. Darüber, dass das Wifi nur im Wohnzimmer funktionierte, wusste sie Bescheid (kein Signal in den anderen Räumen aufgrund der dicken Wände). Wir konnten uns gut mit Silvia unterhalten und stellten fest, dass sie eine sehr sympathische Person ist.\r\n\r\nDa die Wohnung von Silvia selbst nicht bewohnt wird und mit weiteren des Gebäudes von ihr nur vermietet wird, ist es ihr nachzusehen, dass sie über bestimmte Gegebenheiten nicht Bescheid weiß. Dennoch würden wir als Pärchen die Wohnung nicht wieder buchen, da sie unserer Meinung nach eher für eine Partygruppe geeignet ist."},{"_id":"86658297","date":{"$date":"2016-07-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"790482","reviewer_id":"69171569","reviewer_name":"Ivan","comments":"Appartement idéalement situé dans une petite rue calme entre la Sagrada Familia et le Passeig de Gracia et pas très loin du métro.

When we tried to reach the \"host\" we had no replies via airbnb or the numbers provided until 24 hours after we tried to make contact. We had a snow storm that delayed our arrival and when we tried to communicate this to the host we never even heard back from her, making for a very stressful experience while on the road.

I chose the apartment because of the location close to my school.\nThere were no problems in the apartment: bathroom, heating, refrigerator all worked as they should.\nThe layout of the apartment is not optimal: the living room seems added to the apartment, and the cold gets in through the windows. Sleeping on the couch in winter is a cold experience - in summer it is no problem.\nAlso the apartment doesn’t have a table or a desk. This was no problem the first month or two, as I did my writing and reading in cafes, but it would have been nice to have the opportunity to work from the apartment after a couple of months in cafes.\n\nRight next to the apartment is a school and a schoolyard. The windows from the living room face the schoolyard, and the sound from the school is quite loud.\n\nThe neighbour upstairs has a cat that gets up early. From the adjacent apartments you  can hear everything from the neighbours, and they from me. The noise didn’t bother me, because I sleep well and am not bothered by noise, but take it into consideration if you are noise sensitive.\n\nThe laundry dryer had some problems, so for some weeks I had to find other solutions, but it was solved, and I could wash again.\n\nI didn’t cook at home. Kitchen is small, but clean. There are not many kitchen tools in the kitchen, but as I didn’t cook, this was no problem."},{"_id":"407463052","date":{"$date":"2019-02-02T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7918194","reviewer_id":"13979232","reviewer_name":"Alexander","comments":"Location is wonderful only 1 min. from Istiklal and 5 min from Taksim square. You can find all utensil and spices for cooking. The apartment is clean and big. There aren't independent entrance. The stairs is very narrow ( the apartment on the 3 floor) it will be uncomfortable if you have a big luggage. For me was a big problem a bad sound insulation. I heard all what happened in the apartment on the up floor. Neighbors from above did not sleep ( it's look like), they constantly walked, talked, laughed and this could go on until the very morning.

There were also lots of fresh fruits and delicious fresh bread from a local patisserie.  \n\nWe brought pop up soccer goals and a ball for my son to play a bit in the back garden and they didn't mind at all.\n\nThere are beach chairs, a beach umbrella and little extras left for you to use during your stay that makes the whole experience special and easy.  They've really tried to think of everything that you might need during your stay.\n\nThe house is a 5 minute walk to the beach and a short walk to town.  As I was with a little one I drove more than I walked and Palm and Whale Beach are also a short drive away.\n\nI have recommended many of my friends to stay here and I will certainly be staying here again soon!

We asked for an early check in which at this time of year (January)they could not do but to compensate there was a bottle of French Champagne in the fridge and a bottle of Aussie Red on the counter. But this was to be the first of many surprises. I then discovered a lovely selection of premium cheeses in the crisper. As well as selection of unopened French jams and spreads just added to the already extensive pantry. The kitchen – every need or requirement had been carefully thought of. Every type of glassware and china in the cupboards was of the highest standards in design and style and again very generously provided. The kitchen appliances, fridge, washer/Dryer, stove was all of the highest specification and all as new. Entertaining was a so easy. The generous designer lounge spilled out onto the terrace. State of the art technology provided many hours immersed in the latest movies. The windows featured an electronic block out blind for privacy and to mange the sun. Internally a thoughtful arrangement of blinds managed the totally privacy of the areas. Again, premium appliance including a Bose sound System and Jet Master Fireplace. Designer furniture, Interiors books and magazines. Picture windows opening on to the stunning tropical garden. As well as delightful collection of original artwork from the region. The Terrace – again every need had been carefully thought of. Centering on a delightful table for 8 the designer flagstone floor flowed seamlessly via concertina doors opening into the lounge. A huge 4 burner BBQ, ceiling mounted outdoor heating. Generous collection of Comfortable premium garden furniture to enjoy the stunning garden. Stylish beach mats provided. In the main bed room good design was again present in everything they had chosen. The premium beds and linen and towels were all immaculate. Stylish bathroom, double sink and huge European bath, heated towel rails, hair straightener and hair dryer, Spare Razors, makeup removal pads, cue tips and designer toiletries. – again, everything carefully provided. Double hanging and 30 black velvet covered hangers – generosity again. A fresh arrangement of orchids on the Dresser. Generous selection of fresh designer Turkish towels and Beach bags. Generous designer bath and beach towels provided. The second bedroom featured a double bed and again generous hanging and storage. It features a generous library of classics and current design and food books that kept me entertained for hours. Another large stylish en-suite bathroom with every need again considered.

The size and facilities for our family of 4 was perfect ( the washing machine, dryer and lovely garden was especially handy having two young kids) Our privacy was not at all compromised yet Angela made sure she was available for any questions or help we may have had. The amenities located around the beach house are excellent and all within walking distances. I will say pushing a stroller with a toddler in tow was particularly tiring when returning back from the beach as the beach house was located at top of a relatively steep hill. I would bare this in mind if you plan to not hire or take a car.

Also had a high which we didn't end up use during our trip.  We were really only there to sleep as our trip to Maui was short and we were trying to see the whole island so we didn't get to take advantage of the beach across the street which would have been fun, especially with all the beach gear that is provided.  To sleep 6 people, 2 must sleep on the pull out bed in the living room which was not the most comfortable.  That was a little disappointing, other that that, I would recommend it and come back and stay again.  Next time, I'd save a day to enjoy the beach across the street with it being so easy to come back to the condo by a short walk.

Our teenage boys LOVED snorkeling all morning with tons of turtles and boogie boarding all afternoon in perfect little waves. The beach isn't crowded because there aren't any big resorts - it feels very \"local\". \nEveryone at the condo complex was very friendly. The pool is nice and it was great to have the BBQ area within the pool area so we could grill and relax while our kids swam. \nIt's perfectly located just south of one of the main beaches in Kihei where took surf \nlessons. It's also walking distance to the Kihei Caffe... one of our favorite places!\nRebecca was very responsive by text.

As our flight was early, Gavin kindly made arrangements for my friend \u0026 I, to be able to check in early.  \r\n\r\nThe location of the apartment is amazing. It is literally less than 5mins walk from Central Station. The room is much larger than what we expected from the pictures, it had plenty of  room for our luggage. The apartment was clean, the room and bathroom immaculate, bed and pillows were comfortable and clean. Gavin even has a hair dryer for us ladies or guys with really long hair. \r\n\r\nWe spent the day wondering around Surrey Hills and coming from Melbourne I need my coffee in the morning, Sample coffee on Devonshire st  and Le Monde on Foveaux St has amazing coffee and it is just around the corner less than 5mins walk.   \r\nThat evening we spent dinner with Gavin and had a enjoyable conversation while watching my AFL team WIN, GO HAWKS! \r\n\r\nGavin is a great host making us feel welcome and comfortable, making sure we had everything we needed for our stay. Living in the area Gavin knows where everything is, is it spot on with recommending place to eat around Surrey Hills and its all within walking distance( I have said that enough already? lol). \r\n\r\nYOU MUST try the pie's at Bourke St Bakery and Churros from Movida.\r\nAs you can see I'm BIG on food. I Loved that we were only 5 mins walk away from china town, there is also a taxi depot in the next street so we had no issues getting a cab. \r\n\r\nIf you are down for the weekend over spring head down to The Rocks for the markets and eat macarons at la renaissance café and the food stalls there amazing food!\r\n\r\nIf your a foodie like me my favourite places to eat was: Din Tai Fung for dumplings, be prepared to wait but they are worth it, Gumshara Ramen for their thick tonkotsu broth and N2  ice cream in Chinatown, Ms g's for a twist on Vietnamese food in Potts point. Around Surrey Hills Morh fish, Bourke st Bakery, Ruben Hills and Chur Burger.\r\n\r\nAll in all , with our bellies full, our legs and feet exhausted we had a great experience in Sydney and staying with Gavin and would defiantly stay again without hesitation.

This meant that on the morning we flew into Sydney we could go straight from the airport to Central by train and leave our suitcases there for the day while we did some sightseeing, then we picked up our cases in the evening and walked round the corner to Gavin's. Easy! And the place was so central that we could easily get to all the tourist destinations we wanted to either by foot or by a quick train ride from Central Station.\n\nAnother great feature of Gavin's place was the bed - it was soooo comfortable! I actually came down with the flu whole we were there and had to spend a couple of days on bed, and having a cosy bed to sleep in all day really helped.\n\nGavin was polite and friendly and gave us lots of privacy, which we appreciated. The place was clean and exactly as advertised. It's not a luxury hotel to spend lots of time hanging out in, it's more a convenient base to sleep in for people who want to spend their days out and about seeing Sydney.\n\nThe only negative about the place is that we were there during an exceptionally cold and rainy week in Sydney, and the room had no heating so was very cold overnight. But I'm sure during a normal week of Sydney weather the room temperature would be perfect. We were just unlucky with the timing of our visit.\n\nAll in all we recommend Gavin's place for anyone wanting a clean, easy, convenient base right in the middle of Sydney. Thanks, Gavin!"},{"_id":"20157292","date":{"$date":"2014-09-24T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"794910","reviewer_id":"8584674","reviewer_name":"Andrea","comments":"Great location!

There are two subway stops at less than 10min from the appartment which is very convenient, the ride to Manhattan is about 40min. There are also buses directly to Williamsburg and Prospect Park, it takes about 20min to get there.\r\nWe found a delicious bakery (Albany Bakery) close to the subway which became our breakfast spot. In general it is better to buy breakfast, water, fruits in the neighborhood as it is way cheaper than in Manhattan.

Cerca hay muchas tiendas para comprar comida, en lo personal encontramos un mini súper mercado (Fine fare supermarket, sobre Kinstong av.) en el cual había un gran surtido y buenos precios. También a unas cuantas calles habia una lavandería. El barrio es muy tranquilo y seguro, en ocasiones llegamos después de la 1 am y nos sentíamos muy seguras al regresar al departamento.

One night we connected our computer to their tv via HDMI and enjoyed a movie.  The wifi was also strong allowing us to use it outside on the patio or front porch. We loved the neighbourhood too because it's close to Jean Talon Market and practically every street has a bike path so we biked everywhere (you can rent scooters and ebikes at Dyad to get around faster). There are a bunch of parks nearby, and Little Italy, Rue St. Denis, Mont Royal and Mile X are a short bike ride or walk away. We also found parking on the street right in front of the house without issue. Geneviève was a great host too. She was very responsive. The key exchange was easy since she left the key in a lockbox (much safer than the usual mailbox method). And she wrote down a bunch of amazing restaurant suggestions that we tried...

He provided us with lots of detailed information on his apartment and the area.  When we arrived we were greeted by Eric's parents who checked us in and took us for a walk around the neighbourhood, showing us where to find bus stops and supermarkets etc.\r\nThe apartment itself is only around 400sq ft so it was a little cramped for myself and my husband, but it had everything we needed - was well equipped and there was room to put clothes away and to relax.  I particularly liked sitting at the desk looking out at the views towards Kowloon.\r\nThe Neighbourhood is very local, peaceful and quiet.  It is a little trek to the nearest MTR (Lok Fu) - I would say around 15-20 minutes which isn't so bad but if you want the convenience of having the MTR around the corner this apartment probably isn't for you.  If you want somewhere away from the bustling crowds then this is perfect.  The clubhouse facilities are great, I used the gym many times, always very quiet.  We did not get a chance to use the pool but it did look lovely and would be perfect on a hot sunny day.\r\nI would definitely recommend Eric's apartment, it was very clean, with a comfy bed, well equipped kitchen, spacious bathroom in a welcoming and friendly building.  Lots of great places to eat in Kowloon City and Lok Fu market is up the road which has a great choice of fresh fruit/veg/meat and fish.\r\nEric was always on hand if we needed to text him and he always provided help straight away - a good host."}]}

There's a 7-11 store across the building. Checking in was easy! Helen provided us with the building code and all the instructions. When we got there, no one answered the door so we had to call the contact number Helen provided. The building guard was nice enough to let us use their phone so we were able to get the door code quickly. When we got inside, our assigned room was open and was ready. The room as small, but it was okay for the price. There was not enough room to move around but it was perfect for budget travelers like me who just need a place to crash in after a long day of touring around. No towels provided but I already knew that so I brought my own. They had a hair dryer inside, adapter, tissues and shampoo and bodywash inside the bathroom. There's also a Flatscreen TV. Bed was comfortable and I slept like a baby! Our room has no window, so if you're claustrophobic this might not be the room for you. Overall, We had a pleasant stay. Will definitely stay here again.

Its location is so convenience, you can find drug store, 711, good restaurants, taxi stand, MTR stations nearby. You should try dimdimsum restaurant, Woosung street hawker bazaar, those two were my favorite restaurants there and their price was reasonable.\r\n\r\nThe room size was decent and can fit some people just like described on the listing. I booked 3 rooms for 8 people and we stayed for 5 nights in Austin Inn. We didn't spend much time on the room, just for resting at night, and cleaning ourselves so I think it's really a good deal and the price is pretty reasonable.\r\n\r\nYou can get taxi if you want to get to HKIA fast for around HKD 240-250.\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed my stay here.

Usually for this price you would be forced to share a room. WiFi is fast. Staff are friendly. To access the hotel it requires a swipe card and then you have your own key to the room, I felt like my items were secure. As an added bonus the outlets were universal so I could plug my electronics straight into the wall, no need for a universal converter.\r\n\r\nIt seems a little disconcerting at first, especially to those not used to HK, as the place is tucked away. That's fairly normal for HK. Follow the directions to get there, as a lot of HK intersections are crossed using tunnels underneath the road, so if you are catching public transport use the directions provided. Really friendly staff. I would stay there again. It's in a nice central spot, close to Temple street for night markets, close to Jordan station which is a lovely central spot.

She quickly reply to us regarding about our problems and try to fix things for us. However, about the place, we were very disappointed, since we found things to be quite out-dated from the ones shown in the pictures. Our room had some humidity problems on the wall as well as a slight odor inside the room and bathroom. She told us they are going to fix it asap so, I really hope they put things up to date because at this moment, seems like the have forgotten a bit, keeping the rooms in good conditions. We never expect everything to be brand new, neither to find the place exactly as shown in the pictures, but we do expect to find things in the same conditions as the ones shown in the pictures. The building itself, which has nothing to do with the room, it also a bit rusty and dirty in the common areas, which is quite important for us, but we agree it is not important for everyone. At the end we cancelled and went somewhere else. So, no complains at all about the host, but at this moment, won’t recommend the place, even though is well located and at a “cheap” (for HK standards) price.

Aracele's home is situated in the best place in Rio, Ipenema. Great security and walking distance to ipenema and copacabana beach! There is a park right opposite the building, this park transforms into something magical everyday! A flea market on a Sunday with amazing stuff to shop, fresh produce fruits;vegetables;Pork;meat and local foods on a Tuesday and on every other day it's a beautiful park to meet amazing Brazilian people and their dogs! \nThere are great restaurants around the park and bars u can just have a drink! The central shopping for havainas (a must buy ) and so much more is all just a hop, skip and jump! \nThe home is clean, warm and perfect! \n\nAracele as a host is the best ive ever been with! There is a reason why she is a super host! I travelled with no plan, no list of places to visit! On my first day she helped me with a list of places to visit and foods to eat. She welcomed me and gave me the confidence to go out there and have the best holiday I could have in a strange but beautiful country where no one speaks English!  \n\nAracele was not a host for me but became family, it felt like home and this holiday was my best ever and will always be remembered for a lifetime.

Cele’s house is the best choice in terms of quality/price, location, convenience ( metro, supermarket, restaurants, cafes and gym, yes Gym, are literally downstairs) and her hospitality. You will be amazed what a good deal you are getting.\n\n2) About the host Cele\nWords cannot even describe 1% of who Cele is and how Cele makes me feel and what this experience in Rio with Cele has inspired me. Cele is someone who is special, warm-hearted, super beautiful physically and soulfully. Our connection is so special that I feel like she is my long-lost sister from the other side of the world. ( I was born and raised in China. I could never imagine that there is someone who thinks, fights for life at the other side of the world the same way as I do). Airbnb is so magical that it connects people who seem have nothing in common but eventually turns out to be your best friend who makes you feel so familiar and close! \n\nI will come back for this beautiful city and more importantly for this beautiful and magical rencontre of Cele.

From relaxing on some of the world’s most beautiful white sand beaches to the more adventurous undertakings of zip-lining and paragliding. Kauhale Makai's location is such that there are many activities and attractions right at your finger tips. Some of Maui’s top attractions are: Maalaea Harbor - 6 miles - Many boats leave from Maalaea on snorkeling trips, deep sea fishing, scuba diving, whale watching (in season), sunset cruises, and more. It is much faster to leave from Maalaea Harbor than Lahaina Harbor when taking trips to Molokini Crater and Turtle Town. Other attractions include Maui Ocean Center, Haleakala Volcano, Shops at Wailea, Iao Valley, Wailea Golf Club, King Kamehameha Golf Club, Maui Tropical Plantation, and the Whale Sanctuary. The town of Kihei is a quant, laid-back beach town boasting some of Maui’s most pristine stretches of white sand and turquoise waters.

Nice green open space/lawn to play or set up a picnic to watch sunset.  Right by the water. Condo was on the first floor which was super convenient - our car was parked right around the corner from the condo.  Loved having the small ice chest, beach towels and plastic tupperware to pack snacks and drinks when we went out for long days exploring the island.  Ice maker was a huge plus, along with toaster, coffee maker, and all the cooking utensils.  It was super easy to get around and close enough to Paia, Walea, etc. Having air conditioning was a major plus for having a full night of sleep and rest.  My son slept on the sofa bed and he described it as cozy and comfortable.  Great having a movie night when we were tired from a long day of exploring right in the living room. Viktoria was very helpful in preparing me for our stay and answered all of my questions.  Really enjoyed receiving emails about places to visit and things to do - we got the \"local experience\" versus the tourist traps.  I hope to come back again to the same spot next year!"},{"_id":"97257328","date":{"$date":"2016-08-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8051911","reviewer_id":"81955267","reviewer_name":"Diana","comments":"Great host and place!

Lovely pool, hot tub and bbq area. No privacy as it is along the path to the pool. Anyone walking by can see directly into the unit. Unit generously provided beach amenities to borrow such as cooler, beach chairs, umbrella, beach towels, floaties.\r\n\r\nUnit was clean and sufficient but is in desperate need of updating. Outdated kitchen and bathroom - furniture well out of style. Badly needed black out curtains as the landscape lights beam into every window. Expect the stereotypical worn-out Hawaiian room/condo. \r\n\r\nThe price was right, however, and available when we needed it! Viktoria made our transition from unit to unit very easy.\r\n\r\nThis particular unit wouldn't be my first choice to stay in again, but the property is fabulous.

Kihei is a central point for day trips around the island.  It was quite windy while we were there but you don't have to drive far to find a sheltered beach.  We made good use of the beach chairs and took the cooler to watch the sunset one night.  There's plastic containers to pack food etc and cling wrap which is handy.  You cant actually see the sun set from there in June, it goes behind the western part of the island. You might want to take an eye mask if you like to sleep in total darkness because the light is on outside the glass door all night and the curtains are not blockout.  We got a great driving map from the tour desk at reception and the lady there was very helpful.  Being on the ground floor is handy for nicking out to the pool or for a walk and to the car but the balcony isn't that private because people are walking past.  We still ate breakfast out there every morning.  I liked that the unit is cool enough at night not to need the aircon.

Shower head was a bit low so some would need to bend down a bit to rinse out their hair.\nThe beds were not the most comfortable but still able to get a good enough sleep each night."},{"_id":"231360959","date":{"$date":"2018-01-31T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8051911","reviewer_id":"165963874","reviewer_name":"Young Wook","comments":"비교적 추천할만 합니다 위치 좋고 시설도 보통이상 이며 해변도 멋집니다"},{"_id":"234467820","date":{"$date":"2018-02-12T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8051911","reviewer_id":"161730647","reviewer_name":"Luli","comments":"Excelente lugar y muy tranquilo :) nos encantó, excelente tanto para la familia como para amigos.

I sometimes have difficulty keeping sand out of the house at the beach, but the vacuum provided picks it up like a charm. Food trucks and some open-air markets are a couple minutes away\n The beachfront is only a couple hundred feet away, and while that part of the beach is pretty short, it's still great for walking and putting your feet in. This is a good location for other activities, being equidistant from the great southern beaches like Big Beach, and the northern towns and beaches in Lahaina. \n\nSnorkeling at Molokini Crater, the Royal Lahaina Luau, and the Road to Hana were our favorite activities along with just relaxing at the beach."},{"_id":"347105195","date":{"$date":"2018-11-10T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8051911","reviewer_id":"143982103","reviewer_name":"Kayla","comments":"This Airbnb was sparkling clean and had all the amenities we could have asked for.

Additionally, this Airbnb was right on the local bus route, making it incredibly accessible.\n\nThe only thing to note is that travellers arriving after sundown should really familiarize themselves with the map provided before arrival. The garden paths to the buildings are moderately lit, but all of the numbers for the rooms face the inside of the complex. \n\nOverall, this was a fantastic experience that I would not hesitate to repeat. :)"},{"_id":"351164726","date":{"$date":"2018-11-21T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8051911","reviewer_id":"73982175","reviewer_name":"Zita","comments":"While the location is great, be aware that this is an older building.

Loved the emails with local tips of restaurants and things to do on the island. Check in was a breeze since it uses a door code so no keys needed. Bathroom was a bit tiny and could use some remodeling. Only issue was that we saw some cockroaches in the unit. They’re mostly concentrated in the kitchen but also saw one in the bedroom. Not sure if it’s due to the weather, the construction that was happening outside the unit, or the the fact that the unit is on the 1st floor, but we were a bit wary of leaving any bags open after seeing them within the first hour after arriving. Double check with Viktoria if roach traps have been placed throughout the unit before arrival.

They react fast to discuss and solve any questions. \n\nSecond, I want to underline that we had no issues with anything inside the apartment or building during our stay- everything worked properly.\n\nThird, as a mom of 2 kids (3,5 years and newborn) I found everything extremelly equiped in the apartment- furniture, technics, kitchen (all possible things you might even think about) which made my day-to-day life in the apartment easy and no stressful.\n\nFourth, location!!! Location is so great that you can't imaging. You are in the center of life, including central park for kids, skate rings, toys shops, theatres, shopping, restaurants and night life. Also have all subway lines available by walking distance which allows to be anywhere within the shortest time.\n\nI know that will remember the time I spent at this apartment with my family with positive only.

She is very prompt at answering emails, and is very helpful with planning activities while in Princeville and on the island. The location of the condo is very private and quaint in a luxurious area. The best par about it was how clean the entire place was. It made the stay very comforting and relaxing. The condo is very close to Hanalei Bay and the gorgeous Napali coast which we loved much more than the south shore. The description of the condo was very accurate to our experience although we were a group of 6 adults and the 3rd bedroom is a closed off office with a pullout couc (which we knew).  However, our only complaint was that this room is not sufficient for two adults. The pullout couch is full of springs, and when it is pulled out, there is barely any room to walk around, open the entry door or the armoire to access clothes. Also, it does not have A/C, and even with the oscillating fan it is still extremely hot and uncomfortable. It is better suited for children or kept as an office only. We didn't spend much time in the condo as we were eager to get out and explore the beautiful area. Otherwise, the condo was spectacular  "},{"_id":"42251843","date":{"$date":"2015-08-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8104448","reviewer_id":"26904268","reviewer_name":"Laura Cardarelli","comments":"Während unseres Aufenthaltes hat einfach alles gestimmt!

My husband and I found ourselves driving to the west or south part of the island everyday which was approximately an hour drive. However, a rental car was provided which made everything convenient. \n\nBe aware of a few things, 1) this group prefers to communicate via e-mail, not the AirBNB chat. 2) they give you a car with the company Alamo. I couldn’t figure out why everyone was running me over at the airport to get to the car rental area. I later found out it is because cars are “first come, first serve”. So if you want a nicer vehicle, you MUST get there early. \n\nAll in all, awesome place to stay, just not a lot to do in the area."},{"_id":"324344407","date":{"$date":"2018-09-16T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8104448","reviewer_id":"90546317","reviewer_name":"Phillip","comments":"This place was amazing!

Eg: Hanalei Bay was a 5 min drive and Queen's Bath was only a 3 min drive. There was also a grocery store, Foodland, that we stopped at countless times to either pick up a quick breakfast before an early hike or ingredients to take back to cook dinner.

The inside is quite accommodating, with a pleasing, spacious layout and comfortable beds. The hot tub was relaxing and quiet.  We could hear the sound of the ocean at night. It was pleasant to watch the birds on the rooftops from the outside upper balcony. Washer and dryer were large and functioned well. Laundry detergent was in the cupboard. The car rental was easy. We had no issues picking up or returning the car.  Everything we needed for the beach was provided: snorkel equipment, beach towels, surf board, cooler . . .Cons: The pool could have been warmer. The gated community had a lot of neighbors and light on every door that made it hard to see the stars at night though we eventually discovered we could walk up the road to the golf course and walk that path at night, which was nice. The biggest concern was the location, which required significant driving every day to get to the things we wanted to do such as hike at Waimea Canyon, take a boat tour of the Na' Pali Coast, and visit Poipu Beach. We drove a lot because of where we stayed. \nThis is a beautiful place to bring the family if you want to do activities near Princeville."},{"_id":"419423914","date":{"$date":"2019-03-03T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8104448","reviewer_id":"22345059","reviewer_name":"Kristen","comments":"This place was truly amazing and definitely met our expectations.

The complex itself was quiet, offered beautiful views of the mountains and was less than 5 minutes from the Princeville shopping center. The only downside was the internet was spotty at times.

This place was one of the best designed I've ever been in. I stayed for 2 weeks and was perfectly comfortable using it as a home base the entire time. It's not big at all though, but the layout flows so nicely you shouldn't mind. I think it's great for a single traveler or maybe a vey cosy couple, but I wouldn't recommend it for more (though Jenny also does the same). The building is centrally located and the halls are a bit dingy, but they open up to a really fun and bright apartment, like a nice secret surprise.

With that being said, I was very impressed with Carmen and Charlie as they were both extremely accommodating and friendly.\r\n\r\nTo begin, my flight was actually pushed back and so instead of arriving around 7pm, my friend and I ended up arriving 2 hours later (9pm). We mentioned this to Carmen \u0026 Charlie immediately and both were very understanding and even picked us up at the bus station because they were worried that we were going to get lost :) #YAY. In addition, both hosts were very helpful and gave us a map/directions so that we could get around HK. They gave us honest feedback on what places to go to when one travels to HK and gave recommendations on places to eat and shop.\r\n\r\nIn terms of location, we stayed in Mongkok and the apartment was actually right in the middle of ladies market, which were both convenient and lively. The apartment was clean and rules of the home were reiterated upon arrival, which served as a good reminder. \r\n\r\nThe room itself was definitely large enough for 2 people to live in, but I may be biased because my friend and I are both rather small and we enjoy the simplicity of a smaller room. If you're a larger person, you might enjoy a bigger room but I don't think large rooms are very common in HK to begin with. By the way, there is no elevator to get to the 4th floor (where you will be staying) so I hope you packed light and is ready for a short workout everyday!\r\n\r\nThe description that Carmen and Charlie provided on their profile was definitely accurate but I think additional information might be helpful such as the number of showers (they had 2!), number of actual rooms they had, as well as the high potential of living with other fellow Air BNB'ers (as this might be a turn off for some people who are looking into this space).\r\n\r\nOther than that, I loved living in this space and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to live in a traditional yet cute little home while staying in HK. Both Carmen and Charlie are super sweet and both tried their very best to make sure we enjoyed our stay. I plan on staying in touch with the both of them :)"},{"_id":"49996996","date":{"$date":"2015-10-08T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8144456","reviewer_id":"30943744","reviewer_name":"Cherie","comments":"The host is nice but we had issues with our agreement and she tried to over charge us which lead us to several awkward moments and unpleasant moments during out trip.

It's less than a 10 minute walk down to Poipu Beach and you can't beat the views! We enjoyed many breakfasts, dinners, cocktails and morning coffees out on the deck. The deck is shared with only one other unit so it's super private and exclusive. It was the envy of other guests at the complex! The pool is also right above the sea cliffs which is cool on its own but is also very well maintained and great for afternoon dips while listening to the sound of waves!"},{"_id":"187296696","date":{"$date":"2017-08-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8152655","reviewer_id":"10488377","reviewer_name":"Elizabeth","comments":"My boyfriend and I had a wonderful time at GVR's Poipu Shores 101B! The best aspect, of course, is the oceanfront lanai. We spent most of our time out there watching sea turtles swimming nearby or enjoying a glass of wine at sunset. Overall, the unit is exactly as pictured. The folks at GVR are also very responsive which we appreciated. A few items worth noting - the space wasn't as clean as I'd expect (floor of the bath tub is stained from so much use and front door handle needs replacing, there were also stains on the pillow cases of the bedding). There is also no cell service in the unit. This was difficult for us initially as there was a storm during our first day/night which disconnected the wifi from 3pm until about 10am the next morning (a fairly long time after the rain had stopped). We got our iPad and my boyfriend's cellphone to connect to the wifi afterwards, but my cellphone was never able to connect. A bit inconvenient for me, but since we had the iPad it wasn't detrimental to our trip. Nonetheless, we enjoyed our stay very much and would recommend to anyone. The lanai can't be beat!"},{"_id":"190287864","date":{"$date":"2017-09-03T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8152655","reviewer_id":"141754463","reviewer_name":"Casey","comments":"The location is wonderful.

We booked a different condo managed by GVR, but as soon as we landed in Kauai, we got a call stating that the condo was no longer available.  Poipu Shores 101B was offered as an alternative.  Poipu Shores had lots of issues for us, especially since we were traveling with a toddler.  We ended up leaving after one night and found a better place down the road for the rest of our vacation.  \n\nPoipu Shores 101B is probably ok if you're just looking for a comfortable bed, not traveling with a child, and can put up with a fairly run down condo with no cell service.  The pool was very dirty also.\n\nOur main issue with GVR is that they listed (and confirmed) a unit that wasn't even available to rent.  That was very frustrating to deal with during our vacation, especially since we were traveling with a toddler."},{"_id":"241130936","date":{"$date":"2018-03-07T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8152655","reviewer_id":"109060177","reviewer_name":"Ashley","comments":"Great location by the sea.

Gym on site and onsite underground parking available (though at an additional charge of $30/day). Laundry in the apartment was an added benefit. \n\nAlejandro was responsive leading up to the trip and very friendly. It was a bit harder to reach him during our stay, but he works with a company (Corporate Stays) that was reachable during their business hours, and Corporate Stays was able to assist with any of our questions/concerns.\n\nThough the apartment is a bit pricey, I thought the location was excellent and the space was comfortable.

It’s half a block from the best end of Waikiki Beach, right by the calm waters of the break wall. Duke’s Statue, considered central Waikiki, is a 7-minute stroll away. Kaimana, Queens and Diamond Head beaches are less touristy and within easy reach of the condo. Waikiki’s buzz of activity begins on the doorstep, the building is blessed to have an ABC store, cafes, coffee shops including a Starbucks, food trucks, restaurants, bars and retail shopping with seconds. Guests are well positioned to visit Honolulu Zoo, Waikiki Aquarium, Kapiolani Park, Diamond Head Crater and KCC Farmers Markets (Saturday 7:00-11:00am). Diamond Head Road and Monsarrat Avenue are streets within walking distance that offer spectacular ocean lookouts and local neighborhood shops.  Mopeds, scoot coupes (two person mopeds), scooters and bicycles can be hired from the condo’s side street at Hawaiian Style Rentals.

We provide earplugs to assist, but would not recommend staying if you are a light sleeper. Room rates are inclusive of the Hawaii general excise tax (4.5% on Oahu) and transient accommodations tax (10.25% statewide).","transit":"The seaside city of Waikiki is accessible on foot, and the key areas of attraction are within a comfortable walking distance from the condo. Waikiki Beach is less than 2-minutes easy walk.  Hiring a vehicle is a fantastic way to explore the rest of the island, as long as you are comfortable driving on the right side of the road. Rental cars can be picked up at Daniel K. Inouye International Airport (formerly Honolulu International Airport) or in Waikiki. There is a Hertz Car Rental depot at Hyatt Regency Waikiki Beach Resort at 2424 Kalakaua Avenue, 7-minutes walk from the apartment.  Our stay includes free undercover parking, which is a huge bonus because parking in Waikiki is expensive. Hotels and parking stations will charge between USD20.00-USD40.00 per night.  Shared or private shuttles can be pre-booked to take you from the Airport to Waikiki hotels. The closest hotel to our condo is next door at “Hyatt Place Waikiki”. Taxis are available on arrival at the Airport and are flagged","access":"Stay includes one undercover car space.

It was easy to get to from the airport, and an easy place to drive to anywhere you wanted on the island.  \n\nJust as described it does get busy and noisy at night and morning, so if you are a light sleeper, would recommed ear plugs.

A group of 5 adults stayed in this condo, and we had plenty of space. The bedrooms were both beautiful, the beds were comfortable, the apartment was clean and intuitively organized. Having a washer/dryer in the unit was so useful. The welcome guide gave us plenty of ideas on where to eat and go around the area. Ashlee was super communicative, constantly making sure we were settled and happy. This apartment was a stone's throw from the beach, and from awesome restaurants. The ONLY thing (and I want to stress, this is not a negative! More something to be aware of) is the noise level outside the apartment at all times of day. There were constant tour buses and trucks loading and unloading at the neighboring hotels. It did wake us up quite early in the morning, but hey, then we got to get an early start to our day! My suggestion is if you're sensitive to noise when you sleep, bring ear plugs. I'm sure this problem isn't unique to this unit, it's a city so something to be expected. It didn't detract from the wonderful time we had in this beautiful unit. Thank you so much, Ashlee! We will be back!"},{"_id":"65019791","date":{"$date":"2016-03-10T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8190277","reviewer_id":"46261983","reviewer_name":"Riya","comments":"Our family of 5 (me, my husband, elderly but spry parents in their 60's, and our 2 yr old) stayed in Ashlee's condo and we had a wonderful time. Ashlee is such a responsive and helpful host that she made this Airbnb booking a breeze. As previous reviewers have mentioned, you will hear noise but please keep in mind that you are in Waikiki and there is noise everywhere. Ear plugs were conveniently provided which my husband used and I just played some background sleep music which solved our problem since we are very light sleepers anyway. There was a small issue upon check-in with the air-conditioner condenser tube dripping water off the outdoor lanai (which didn't affect us directly), but Ashlee took care of it immediately while we were having fun at the beach and when we came back we were pleasantly  greeted with fresh pastries from a local bakery that Ashlee had left for us! Awesome right? \n    The condo was as pictured, very clean (I didn't have the instant urge to sanitize and wipe everything down when I walked in), and had a well designed use of space. We didn't feel cramped at all and loved having the new washer \u0026 dryer to use so that we didn't have to lug tons of dirty laundry back home. \n    The condo is conveniently located near everything and we had a blast walking a few minutes to \"The Pool\" which is a barricaded area of beach that is very safe for little babies/toddlers/ and anyone who doesn't prefer to swim in the open ocean with waves. \n  Another thing to note was that the condo was well stocked with many of the necessities and this may seem trivial, but nice toilet paper, soft bath towels, \u0026 Tide detergent were provided! With hotels cutting back we've stayed at 4 \u0026 5 star resorts recently where they provide what seems like sand paper for bathroom tissue and off-brand detergent that doesn't clean very well. Obviously we usually and can easily buy these things ourselves, but small details such as these is what makes a stay distinguishable.  \n   Overall, we would definitely recommend this condo due to the location, value, and Ashlee being such a warm, attentive, \u0026 great host. We look forward to coming back the next time we visit Waikiki. Thanks Ashlee for opening up your home to us and making our stay such a wonderful one!

The condo was perfect for what we were looking for, which was two couples who wanted walking access to Waikiki and close to the beach. They also offer a parking spot which is extremely helpful as we rented a car to take day trips to the other beaches.  There are two bedrooms, one of the beds is a Murphy bed. They also have two pullout beds located in the living room couch and ottoman. Both bathrooms are located in the bedrooms. Something to consider if you have people staying that aren't sleeping in the bedrooms. They will have to walk through a bedroom to use the restroom. I would also note that this condo is located in a very lively area. So it can be noisy on the streets. Ashlee does provide earplugs. Also there are no shades on the windows, so it is very open to natural light. Again, not an issue for our group as the sun does not rise in the areas the windows are, but if you are light sensitive sleeper, you may want to bring an eye mask. Overall the condo is really nice and modern. The appliances are all very new and all the furniture is comfortable and clean. They have AC and also a washer/dryer. You can tell Ashlee definitely pays attention to the property and cares about her guests.The location, quality, parking and space are extremely hard to find so close to Waikiki. I'd highly recommend staying here, and am planning on returning for my next trip.

She managed to do this while being low-key and honoring our privacy; hence a big thumbs up and many thanks to Ashlee!\r\n\r\nAmenities: There is not a thing that is missing here. Silverware, extra towels, extra blankets, snorkels, board games - you name it; it's there. As others mentioned, the washer/dryer set and the private parking lot space came in super handy and were a huge plus that cannot be enjoyed in regular hotels.\r\n\r\nLocation: A two-minute walk to Waikiki - what more can you say. There are lots of restaurants and a Starbucks within a couple of blocks. We've definitely enjoyed having meals with an unhindered view of the ocean.\r\n\r\nSound: Sound level could be an issue (the apartment is on a lower level of a twelve-story building), but earplugs provided by Ashlee solved the problem for us. However, I think future customers should be aware of this problem.\r\n\r\nAll in all, fantastic host, fantastic location, and fantastic condo.

So if you close the doors, the two BRs will run very hot.  Leave the doors open unless privacy outweighs temp comfort.  \r\n\r\nThere are also things for the beach, such as floating beds, towels, mats, and even a football.

Truly a host that cares about your experience. We had some issues with a fan, cable and internet that were quickly addressed. Convenient location and spacious condo, with great added amenities like a pack and play for our infant and a beach umbrella and mats. The only thing I would note is that there is only one AC unit in the living room, so the master bedroom can get stuffy if the fan isn't left running. Also the noise, which Ash does note in the listing, can be quite significant even with ear plugs that she thoughtfully provides. I did end up having to book a separate hotel room for my mother after the first night due to the noise, but my husband, infant and I did fine with a white noise machine that we brought."},{"_id":"126542444","date":{"$date":"2017-01-12T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8190277","reviewer_id":"30628979","reviewer_name":"Lin","comments":"Ashlee was amazing about communication and flexibility on check in/check out.

It's spacious, nicely decorated and in a great location. Check in/out was super easy. Ashlee was always available to answer any questions and was super helpful -even with trying to find a great sunset spot. I didn't have issues with noise in the front bedroom- mostly city noises.. if you are an urban dweller, you wouldn't notice anything. The \"master\" seemed more quiet perhaps. Everything was beautiful and clean. There were plenty of beach towels and mats, as well as kids beach toys if needed. There were also spare sheets and pillow for couch guests if needed. We used the laundry many times and enjoyed some evening drinks on the lanai. Apparently this part of Waikiki is very expensive so, the price of the airbnb is definitely more than fair for the quality and condition of this place. According to a local living in the area, this is definitely a beautiful place which could garner some very high rent as a residence. Parking onsite was terrific and made it easy to have a rental car.  Overall we were very impressed and would suggest this to anyone! We were single girls traveling in a group and we loved it!  As a bonus the ABC- store is right next door- so anything you might need is a block away.  Definitely worth the money, Waikiki is a pricy area and you get what you pay for. Loved it!!!!\n\n"},{"_id":"129707218","date":{"$date":"2017-02-01T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8190277","reviewer_id":"14780519","reviewer_name":"Haelim","comments":"위치가 매우 좋습니다.

The home was beautiful and very modern.   We really appreciated the large washer/ dryer set up to do towels, bathing suits, etc.    The home was tastefully decorated, clean, and welcoming!  The location was so perfectly close to downtown and all the local restaurants/ shops.   Ashlee was lightening quick in responses and was very helpful in keeping us up to date when the elevator in the building was inoperable.      Our teenage son LOVED having his own bed and bathroom.   Ashlee also provided a wealth of local knowledge and helpful tips and recommendations as well. \n\nMy only comment would be similar to those listed previously.   This location is very loud with city noise.  There are 2 loading docks for hotels immediately outside the window.   With earplugs (graciously provided by the owner) and the AC floor unit running in the bedroom, we were able to sleep most of the night.   However, it can get very noisy with horns, sirens, etc.   Like you would expect any living to be at 2 stories above a busy city block.  Again, NO FAULT of the owner at all  Ashlee was a tremendous host who shared excelled local tips which made our visit wonderful.  This was a great experience.

Ashlee was great at giving us tips on where to go and what to do.  She's very responsive.\n\nThe pictures are accurate and the street noise I found as acceptable. It didn't bother anyone in my group, probably because everyone was so exhausted from the beach so they slept like rocks.\n\nParking was easy and great to have. You are a short drive to all the great beaches on the windward side.\n\nBathrooms and kitchen were clean. No issues with the washer and dryer.  \n\nThis place is in a great location.

My family loved being able to unwind and play board games  or watch Netflix after a long day exploring or chilling on the beach. Location is perfect and yes oh so close to everything! We were picked up on the same street for most the tours we booked. \nThe unit is fully equipped and there was a lot more provided than expected for example Aloe Vera gel in the fridge and laundry detergent. Also, it was so convenient to have access to a large washing machine and dryer. It meant we didn’t need to pack as many clothes or come home with suitcases full of dirty clothes. Having the kitchen and large fridge meant we could buy groceries and eat some meals in. Eating out and feeding a family of 5 can get really pricey in Waikiki. \nAshlee’s place is fantastic for families and next time we will skip staying in a 5 star hotel and come straight here!

It is about a 15-20 minute walk to the most popular attractions/restaurants/shops on Waikiki. You might be closer if you stayed at one of the top hotels, but I think this is appropriate for an AirBnB location. 18 minute drive Honolulu airport. \n- Cleanliness. The apartment was very clean, and I felt very comfortable in it. Bathrooms were very clean, kitchen was spotless. There were some minor issues (see below for Cons)\n- The host (Ashlee) had exceptional communication. She replied within hours of my messages to her, answering all my questions. This made me feel very connected, safe and secure with where I was staying\n- Hosts thought of everything to make the trip successful and pleasant. There were beach towels, a vacuum machine for miscellaneous sand you might have brought in. Soaps, laundry detergent, shampoo/conditioner/lotion. \n- Very kid friendly apartment. There were beach toys for kids, a wagon if you needed it, high chairs, strollers, a pack and play, a newborn basinet. \n- Check in was VERY smooth. Great directions sent out by Ashlee\n\nCons:\n- We had issues with some broken windows upon arrival. When we landed in Hawaii after 11 hours of travel, all we wanted was to get into a cool apartment, relax and head to bed. However, our plans changed when we got to the apartment and realized that some of the windows were broken, allowing all of the air from the AC to get out, and it was hard to keep cool air in. My husband had to move some furniture as well as put up towels on the broken windows to keep the cool air in. \n- We also had issues with a bad smell in the master bedroom, I had to wash some sheets as well as move an air freshener into the room to make the smell go away. \n- Ashlee communicated GREAT with me about these 2 issues. She came to the apartment ASAP and fixed what she could.  Sounds like it was issues with previous guests in the apartment, not necessarily the apartment itself. She also refunded me a small portion of the cost to accommodate for these issues. \n\nOverall, I highly recommend this apartment for anyone traveling to Hawaii. We had a great time, all because Ashlee is an amazing host. THANK YOU for making this a memorable trip for our small family."},{"_id":"346209302","date":{"$date":"2018-11-07T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8190277","reviewer_id":"93240108","reviewer_name":"Marquez","comments":"Wow!

The ability to make your own meals, wash and dry laundry in the condo and  to have a parking spot at the condo building  for a rental car was a rare find.  Many other amenities like laundry detergent, dishwasher detergent, shower gel, shampoo and conditioner, regular linens and beach towels, etc. are provided.  There's boogie boards, and other beach toys you can haul to the beach in a very handy wagon that's provided.  Don't bring tolitries as there's ABC stores in every block that  provides the right tanning lotion (to protect the coral reefs) and almost anything else you need or want.  Save your receipts and take them in to the ABC store at the end of your trip for nice free gifts.   ABC stores sell snorkels and fins; snorkeling tours provide them - so don't bother packing them.   Waikiki beach was literally  a two minute walk from this condo so besides swimming and sunbathing,  it was fun to watch the sunset and Friday night fireworks from that stretch of beach.  We also walked to many of the nearby attractions, shops and restaurants.  We were able to travel all over the island in our rental car but go early in the morning as parking space is an issue later in the day.  Many tours will pick you up right across the street from this condo.  Ubers are also quite prompt - mostly within 2-5 minutes.  Ashlee provides a lot of written information about things to do, but one should plan ahead of time (before your trip) for any special adventures you don't want to miss like zip lining on the north shore or snorkeling off the Oahu coastline  or taking a sunset sail off of Waikiki as they fill up fast.   While the bus is a cheap way to take a group to the north shore of the island, if you use the bus for that be sure to use the express routes that only run a couple times/day.  Otherwise the bus running the regular route will  be stopping at every stop - and it will take hours. Bus is often not on time.    The food trucks at the North Shore are fabulous.  Leonard's Bakery with Portuguese donuts are to die for.  Ashlee's availability when we wanted to contact her was great - even when she had to be out of the country!  Oahu is a great island for multi-gen family experiences.  This condo is ideal."},{"_id":"402850782","date":{"$date":"2019-01-19T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8190277","reviewer_id":"79416453","reviewer_name":"Lee","comments":"What a great stay and Ashlee is a superb communicator.

Art and Ed were happy to guide me through parts of the city, help me plan my days etc. They are very kind and considerate, we had lots of interesting chats at breakfast and other times when going out together.\r\nI would not even think of any other accommodation when I return to NYC!

The location of the apartment in Chelsea, right next to the High Line, is absolutely perfect to explore Manhattan and the rest of NYC. If you plan to extend your trip, the Megabus station with many destinations in the North-East (we traveled to Philadelphia for $7!) is only a 10 minute-walk away. But all these comments on the room would not suffice to guide any future guests with respect to their decision for this place. Maybe more important are Art and Ed who were so much more than AirBnB hosts. They welcomed us like family/friends and were more than happy to share their experiences and recommendations for restaurants, bars, museums and all the little special things that you will never find in any travel guide. Thus, they helped us immeasurably to get the most from our lovely week in New York - thanks again for this!

Very close to the blue metro line A,C,E, ideal to connect directly with JFK Airport, World Trade Center, 42nd Street, various Broadway sections and Times Square, Central Park and the Museum of Natural History, The MoMa, 5th Avenue and Rockefeller Center... The high line, outstanding example of urban architecture and art, is right around the corner, allowing wonderful strolls down to Chelsea Market. Pharmacy, shops and restaurants, and the fascinating waterside are all nearby.  Ed \u0026 Art have prepared a nice colored map allowing you to find the right way to reach the most important places.  Their home is nice and cozy, the hosts are accommodating and relaxed, their cats sweet and quiet. The stairs are steep and narrow, take you time with bulky overseas  luggage. Air conditioning and fans in every room work perfectly and 24/7 round... but probably Europeans will have hard times to get used to the freezer effect and constant buzz (which is the norm all over the city, though, including trains, busses, boats). The room is not sterile or completely empty as in a hotel room, so their stuff and your stuff just look like being part of one family. (Just make sure you don't leave some socks or take away one of their coats). The mattresses were perfect for us, not too hard not too soft, with a thicker and a thinner pillow for those who the perfect height. Bathroom is all black without windows (could be claustrophobic for somebody) but well organized, especially a with spacious shower. What you need is available as in any real home, including books and brochures about the city, spare USA plug adapters, disposable razor blades or some aspirin. Should we come back to NYC sure we come back to Ed\u0026Art, and will definitively recommend it to all our friends.

Arthur gave us some exciting information about the city and advice what things to do and how to get there. If we had more time we probably would have learned more about them and their interesting family history and some more insider facts about NYC.

They have thought of everything to make one’s stay memorable. The spotless bedroom had cable TV mounted over one of the beds, blackout shades over the windows, and even a “white noise” machine to lull you to sleep. The bathroom is wall-to-wall black marble and included brand new toothbrushes and an array of nice colognes. Art made sure that coffee was set up for brewing each morning, coupled with juice, bread, bananas and yogurt. When I arrived the first evening, Art and I sat around the kitchen table with glasses wine and had a great discussion about our backgrounds and about my plans to explore New York when my wife arrived the next morning. I corresponded with Art prior to my visit in order to get suggestions on where the locals go for restaurants. We were not in NYC long enough to try out his long list of places, but we did have a marvelous dinner right downstairs at the Red Cat restaurant and also tried his suggestion for a discrete after-theater place virtually unknown to tourists. Since our plans included a Broadway play on a rainy night, Art and Ed let us borrow a pair of opera glasses and umbrellas to keep us dry. If you are avid walkers, the location is perfect for exploring both mid-town via the High Line, the Chelsea Market, and also lower Manhattan. We did an enjoyable walk all the way downtown to the 9-11 museum. You will also notice that you are surrounded by great little art galleries. We were amazed at the rich collection of Picassos virtually around the corner at the Pace Gallery. In summary, we experienced the perfect combination of interaction with our hosts and freedom to come and go. You will not find more gracious, friendly and helpful hosts as Art and Ed. We can’t wait to go back!"},{"_id":"23834931","date":{"$date":"2014-12-12T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"823520","reviewer_id":"8556383","reviewer_name":"Lou Ann","comments":"Arthur and Ed were terrific hosts, just the right ratio of assistance, advice and respect for privacy, on both host and guest sides, with some fascinating local history thrown in for good measure. Location on the Highline @ 23rd was central to easy subway lines to get to midtown, upper east side or Brooklyn.\nThat said, room was very private, as was the bath, and the main floor parlor/atrium/dining room was lovely. Richest, most lusciously decorated Xmas tree I've ever seen. Wish I was the lucky recipient of some of those gorgeously wrapped presents beneath.

From the initial booking right through to the day we left, our experience was nothing but exceptional! What a pleasure it was to stay with these two gentlemen in their absolutely gorgeous apartment in the heart of Chelsea. Extremely hospitable, caring, talkative without being intrusive and welcoming. \nThe knowledge of the cool places to go was exceptional also. From art and culture places, cafes, restaurants, cocktail bars... Anything we wanted to see or do Art and Ed had some great tips which you won't find in the Lonely Planet guide. \nI got the flu for a couple of days and Ed whipped up his amazing chicken soup for me - which was simply amazing and such a kind hearted gesture. The location is away from the noise and intensity of Times Square but only 1-2 blocks from the Subway, a bus station across the road and a 20 minute walk to Broadway. \nIn summary, Ed and Art are incredibly kind hearted and possibly the most hospitable people I have had the pleasure of meeting. It was certainly a pleasure to stay with them during our time in NYC."},{"_id":"24228770","date":{"$date":"2014-12-23T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"823520","reviewer_id":"21739967","reviewer_name":"Jill Christian","comments":"Arthur and Ed could not have been any more welcoming and helpful.

I cannot recommend Art and Ed's place enough! \nBeing next to the High Line is an interesting experience - you literally get to experience being a part of it ... The location in Chelsea is great and makes a good base to explore NYC. \nSo go ahead and treat yourself to an unforgettable experience and stay with Art and Ed!

I think your place is better than any hotel you could ever stay in. The seperate beds, the lovely bedroom, own bathroom an all those little details, the breakfast setup, the extra tooth brushes, I could go on... But the most important experience was meeting you two! I could have listened to your fabulous life experiences forever and I can imagine spending nights with you over discussing world politics with a good glass of wine.

Seriously, look no further. We could not have possibly chosen a better place to stay, location in the city, or better hosts. ESPECIALLY if this is your first time to the city, Arthur and Ed are so incredibly helpful. They're so prepared for their guests, with lists of suggested things to see/do and food to eat. Some of the best food we had while in the city we would have never known about without their suggestions. They were also very helpful in figuring out the public transportation system, which was SO easy to use from their place. Art encouraged us to text him with any questions throughout our stay, and he responded every time, usually within just a couple minutes, to help us out with suggestions or transportation questions.

Mum and I felt perfectly safe travelling to and from at all hours of the day and night. \nFOOD: We loved having so many great options for eating out right at our doorstep. Art and Ed kindly provided us with coffee and breakfast items and also recommended some awesome places to eat lunch and dinner. If you're lucky, they might even whip up their signature dishes for you - Ed, I'm still thinking about that Navy bean soup :) \nOUR ROOM: oh so comfy beds, perfect temperature, quiet (even though there was renovations happening in the building we didn't hear a thing), TV was great to chill out to, a big plus was power points everywhere for us to charge our gear, sufficient wardrobe space and the bathrobes were a lovely touch! We slept like babies. \nBATHROOM: Spotless, clean, our own space to use with everything we needed right next to our room which was super handy. \nKITCHEN: Personally, I loved this space the most as it was the hub of Art \u0026 Ed's place. A light filled, clean cozy area to have breakfast while watching people walk the highline, recount the day/night adventures to Art \u0026 Ed and if you're deemed acceptable, play with Castor \u0026 Pollux (the tabbies). Got my mum's stamp of approval for clean \u0026 tidy too :)\nLOUNGE: We used the kitchen area mostly but we loved the soft music in the lounge as we came home.  \nART \u0026 ED: Talk about raising the bar - my mum's bucket list trip to NYC was made extra special by these two stand-out hosts. Genuine care for our need for space and a willingness to interact with us, share their stories and listen to ours really helped us to connect with the new Manhattan. Art's communication from the start reassured us that things were organised! Art was instrumental in prioritising our sight-seeing (the UN tour \u0026 The MET rooftop was a great tip) - he's just a wonderfully kind person that we are so grateful to have met :) Ed is full of awesome stories and I wish we had more time to chat!! Thanks for the movie too Ed :) Castor \u0026 Pollux - the space wouldn't be fun without these gorgeous creatures. I'm not a cat person but I loved these two. They keep to themselves and are immaculately clean. \n\nVALUE: If you're looking for the best of NYC \u0026 Airbnb combined, you can't go wrong with these hosts. Can't recommend highly enough. \n\n"},{"_id":"172696637","date":{"$date":"2017-07-21T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"823520","reviewer_id":"68998438","reviewer_name":"Markus","comments":"Simply a wonderful experience and highly recommendable !

We picked Arthur and Ed's place for the location and all the positive reviews and were not disappointed.  Chelsea market, Greenwich village, Flatiron district can all be reached by foot or a short bus/subway ride away.  Since several subway lines have stations on 23rd St., it is easy to access all parts of NYC without the fear of getting lost.  We also felt very safe walking 'home' late at night.  Arthur met us when we arrived and provided a great deal of useful information for us and answered a number of questions we had.  We told him the sites we were visiting and he provided suggestions to restaurants that one would not typically find on tourist sites.  BTW, we texted Arthur for the name of a restaurant he told us about previously when we were in the Financial district and he immediately responded with the info!  He also recommended dinner at the Red Cat restaurant just below the townhouse since we were arriving in the evening and did not want to venture too far for a good meal.  The Red Cat was wonderful and we would definitely eat there again.  We can only second all the reviews about the wonderful accommodations, cleanliness, and  continental breakfast provided.  I especially enjoyed sharing a glass of wine and conversation with Arthur and Ed when we returned early one night.  As mentioned in other reviews, they will provide as much privacy or conversation as their guest desired.  Will not have to spend time looking for accommodations for our next visit to NYC, it will be at Arthur and Ed's."},{"_id":"186824886","date":{"$date":"2017-08-25T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"823520","reviewer_id":"104544063","reviewer_name":"Cindy","comments":"Nice host and location, definitely will visit again when back to NYC"},{"_id":"187829565","date":{"$date":"2017-08-27T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"823520","reviewer_id":"143404141","reviewer_name":"Sue","comments":"Whatever you're planning to do in NYC won't be nearly as good as staying in with Art and Ed over dinner and refreshments. Our only regret is that we didn't stay in every evening with them! They're amazingly generous, incredibly accommodating, and hilariously entertaining. We'll never, and I truly mean NEVER, stay anywhere else when passing through NYC again. You won't regret any of it!!\n\nMy fiance and I are the easy-going type from Ontario, Canada. We have family/friends in Toronto and all over GTA but we even try to avoid that bc of the crowds. So we weren't really looking forward to NYC, even though friends, family, and co-workers obviously gave rave reviews and plenty of suggestions on things to do. We were happy to find this gorgeous penthouse in Chelsea based on their 5 star reviews. Their hospitality is truly above 5.\n\nArt is prompt at getting to know you and eager to offer a true New Yorker experience. We were texting details about ourselves and our ideal NYC experience weeks/days before our arrival. We arrived several hours before check-in and Art nearly demanded we drop our things off and freshen up in their spare bathroom, even if we couldn't access our room yet. We felt so welcomed and ended up staying a couple hours that morning to \"catch up\". Our stay was almost 3 days and left feeling so satisfied with fitting several suggestions that suited us into our visit - nearly all of which were suggestions of Art and Ed's. \n\nThey have wild schedules but never failed to be amazing hosts when we saw each other, like we'd known them for years. And like their site says, they always left coffee and breakfast options available in the mornings, clean accommodations and fresh towels. The rest of their place is spotless and beautifully decorated with all kinds of art and photographs. Art and Ed do well in keeping out of your hair while there, which my fiance and I usually prefer, but we just couldn't get enough of our conversations with them! \n\nMy fiance proposed to be the day after we left Art and Ed's for our cruise and we both actually wished they had been there too to celebrate with us haha. They are, at the very least, the cherry on top of your NYC experience. But they were definitely our highlight!"},{"_id":"193688936","date":{"$date":"2017-09-14T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"823520","reviewer_id":"88280534","reviewer_name":"Karen","comments":"A fantastic place to say, both Art \u0026 Ed make you feel right at home.

Plenty of eating  places nearby, with great recommendations from the guys. Short walk to the Whitney art gallery and really interesting Chelsea Market, but only 2 stops,  on the subway then a couple of blocks walk from Times square or 5 minutes to the World Trade Centre stop and access to downtown.

The bedroom and bath are as shown and very nicely appointed with lots of extra amenities like spare toothbrushes, soap \u0026 shampoo for guests. The rest of the penthouse apartment is also beautifully done up and is a place of light and space. Both Arthur and Ed provided lots of tips for local eateries, transport, things to do etc. Thoughtful touches included provisions for breakfast, a little fridge for my use, bottomless coffee. Their two cats showed up occasionally but in general were too shy to stay in the kitchen and guest areas. Above and beyond all this, Arthur and Ed are very warm and welcoming hosts, and we ended up hanging out in the kitchen having great fun discussing the \"interesting times\" that the USA finds itself in under its 45th President over some food and wine. For me, this interaction was the real plus point of my stay - it’s something that I look/hope for when I'm travelling solo and staying at Airbnb rooms, but which doesn’t always happen. Another plus point was the anti-Trump art in the windows which is a mini-tourist attraction on the Highline - LOL!  Even though they were away for part of my stay, I felt completely secure and at ease in the apartment and with their house sitter. Arthur was always available if I needed to check anything and he also checked in regularly to see that I was ok. My brother and sis-in-law had travelled to NYC as well and there were no issues with them coming to the apartment to hang out before checking in to their hotel etc. In conclusion, I can’t recommend Arthur and Ed highly enough."},{"_id":"259737685","date":{"$date":"2018-05-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"823520","reviewer_id":"132686769","reviewer_name":"Bertrand","comments":"Ce que l'on peut trouver de mieux sur Airbnb à tous points de vue : \n\nAppartement fidèle à la description (calme / confort/ esthétique) \n\nLocalisation optimale en terme d'accès à pied ou en transports en commun à tous les quartiers de NY \n\nNos hôtes :  inégalables ! \nArthur et Ed nous ont accueillis de manière très amicale.

Dans mon cas ça n'a posé aucun problème mais je sais que de nombreux voyageurs auraient eu leur nuit écourtée par ce détail."},{"_id":"217490875","date":{"$date":"2017-12-09T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8238432","reviewer_id":"2045982","reviewer_name":"Stéphanie","comments":"Super appartement situé au coeur d'un quartier vivant.

The space is open and welcoming with large opaque windows and plenty of natural light. Anastasia is easy to reach and responds in a very timely manner if you have any questions or need recommendations. While freezing in the outside, the place stays nice and warm throughout each room which was a big plus for us, non-Montreal-natives. There are plenty of kitchen supplies and utensils, but they can be hard to find as the home has a very 'lived-in' feel and layout. Also, there is no TV, which wasn't an issue, but thought it should be mentioned (luckily there was a speaker with an aux to play some music). The shower can be a little tricky to get the right temperature and the shower door doesn't close fully (wasn't kidding when I said the space is 'open'). But, all of these minor details aside, this space is unlike any other airbnb or hotel you could find and it is absolutely worth staying in."},{"_id":"226240921","date":{"$date":"2018-01-09T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8238432","reviewer_id":"22591506","reviewer_name":"Jeffrey","comments":"Cute, quiet space close to amenities and the metro."},{"_id":"227602241","date":{"$date":"2018-01-15T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8238432","reviewer_id":"101764833","reviewer_name":"Kiralie","comments":"Anastasia was very sweet and kind!

Only a short walk from the Mont-Royal subway stop, which takes you right downtown, the studio is conveniently located in the Plateau, with short walks to some of the cities best neighbourhoods and streets, like Mile End, Laurier-Est and Boul St Laurent. Anastasia was quick to communicate with us, and we appreciated her flexible check-out times which worked so well with our flights. Just a note to future guests that the bed is a futon with a mattress pad, which we weren't expecting. It was a little small for my boyfriend and I and one side had a bit of a bump where the futon folded down which wasn't particularly comfortable to sleep on. That, and the fact that there were no coverings on the large windows (as indicated in the photos) would make it a little difficult for a sensitive sleeper, so I would recommend bringing a sleeping mask if the light at night bothers you as this is an open concept space and everything (aside from the washroom, which was great) is in one space. That was the one thing that was a little misleading about the studio, but otherwise, it was a great space to chill out in after adventuring around the city all day.

Nice, double-lock entryway right on the street. \n\nNote: This home is *genuine* Airbnb! Some Airbnb properties are permanent investments--the owner rents their property full time. This is not the case here-- Anastasia's home is clearly a part-time art studio and home, which makes it personal. The home is astonishingly clean and well maintained! But tourists who expect a sterile, empty hotel-room experience should look elsewhere. Also note that window treatments do not allow you to \"black-out\" the space, so if you need total dark to sleep you should look elsewhere. \n\nOtherwise, come and enjoy a classy, stylish little home! Great, instant communication from the host. Wonderful Indian restaurant and playground one block south. Easy walk to Chocolates de Chloe, Fruiterie  Plateau, Mamie Clafoutis, Park La Fontaine, and other Montreal favorites. Go get hibiscus ice cream at Cremerie Meu Meu!

There are a number of cafes and restaurants at Balmoral and it really is idyllic, whether you go for a stroll along the foreshore or take a dip in the ocean.  It's also an eight-minute walk to the heart of Mosman which is known for its boutique shops, wine bars, cafes and eateries. There is also an IGA supermarket and Franklins which are very close.  The apartment is 12 minutes by bus to the heart of the city. I get the bus every day to go to work and it's very easy and close.","notes":"I grew up in Sydney and I'm very social, so I'd be very happy to send you an email highlighting the best coffee shops, restaurants and bars in Balmoral, Mosman and across Sydney, and anything else you would like to know about Sydney before you arrive. I know all the secret spots:)","transit":"The apartment is very convenient to public transport and it's an eight-minute walk to Spit Junction which is the main transport hub for Mosman. You can catch a bus (they literally come all the time) from Spit Junction to the heart of the city to Wynard, Town Hall or Circular Quay (12 minutes) or an array of places like Neutral Bay, North Sydney New Town (M30), Manly or Chatswood.    There is also street parking and access to taxi services like Uber, but I honestly use public transport all the time.","access":"You will have access to the entire apartment, any essentials that you need like coffee, tea and sugar etc and access to the washing machine and dryer (on the same floor). There is also a small clothes line that can be automated on the balcony.","interaction":"I  will meet you to give you the key and I will be in Mosman. I'll be contactable via phone and text if you have any questions or need any help. More than happy to help you plan your holiday in Sydney and make suggestions!","house_rules":"No children please.

It's clean and bright with all mod cons and very reasonably priced for the fabulous location.\r\nMosman is a bit of a hidden gem of Sydney - one of the most beautiful and fancy spots yet so convenient and with not to much tourist traffic. The flat is right near Mosman shops and there are buses straight into town or down to Manly.\r\nBest of all you can walk down the hill and find yourself at gorgeous Balmoral beach.

One thing that rather caught us off guard was the bare bones accommodations. It's still a great value, but as one of the most inexpensive places to stay on Waikiki you do get what you pay for. (Keep in mind that the free parking is worth easily $20/day.) While it has a kitchen, there is no microwave and no utensils, dishes, or pots and pans. We got some aluminum pans to do some cooking in. Also, the toilet looks like it was designed for a child. And while it's not on the list of amenities, lack of WiFi is unusual. Also, there was construction on the buildings next door and the equipment rolled by right outside our front door, making it impossible to sleep in on a weekday in October 2015. In hindsight it may not have been the best place for us because we didn't spend a lot of time in Waikiki.

Awesome to have a fridge and stove and we used them since the grocery store is across the street. The construction across from the building was loud in the mornings but if you turn the AC on then it muffles it out, and the construction looks to be wrapping up soon anyways. There is no view from the Condo, but the beach and the mountains/canal are so close.

Owen \u0026 Jan were awesome, and so was their place.\r\n\r\nWe came late on March 24th, and Owen welcomed us with a short introduce to his unit and BEERS!!!!!!!! After a long flight, it was much better than what we could expect. He gave us a lot of advices, where to go, what to eat, etc. in Honolulu. \r\n\r\nWhen we entered the unit, we were surprised once again, because it looked exactly like in the pictures, but somehow better, larger, and more comfortable. It has almost everything you need in honolulu: beside cooking stuffs, showers,... it also has a small surfing board, snorkeling tools for two people. One of another plus is the parking lot and the location, grocery stores, beaches, coffees, restaurants, are extremely close and in walk distances.\r\n\r\nDuring our stay, Owen was always responsive, when we needed anything. Actually, we were a little bit careless, so we bothered him a lot, but he was always friendly and extremely helpful. If you have a chance you should also visit Owen in the farmers market. His cake was awesome!\r\n\r\nAll in all, if you are looking for a place, in the heart of Waikiki, with extremely friendly host, a free parking lot and everything ready for your adventure, this is the place you will choose.\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"_id":"72133827","date":{"$date":"2016-05-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8256435","reviewer_id":"65240188","reviewer_name":"Andrew","comments":"Would absolutely recommend staying here!

So many things to do around there! Just not enough time!!! Next time we go back to Waikiki we definitely would book here again.

Perto do mercado (food pantry fica do outro lado da rua), do shopping (Internacional Market), do ponto de ônibus, dos restaurantes e das ruas principais de Waikiki. A vizinhança é bem tranquila! \nTivemos uma intercorrência com a banheira mas foi prontamente resolvida. \nA comunicação com o Owen foi super fácil! Fomos com uma bebê de 1 ano e 3 meses e foi super tranquilo. Apesar de não ter berço disponível, conseguimos improvisar uma cama para ela e deu super certo.

After I confirmed my reservation, he sent me a message about how to make my stay in Waikiki much more comfortable. \n\nLocation - The location can NOT be beat for the price! His place is literally a block away from International Market Place and a couple of blocks away from Waikiki beach. There is a grocery across from the condo too. All the amenities you need is close to his place. We were there for the WAIKIKI Spam jam festival which closed KALAKUA avenue for this annual celebration. THOUSANDS of people packed the street and  although it was fun, there was a lot of noise coming from the free concerts/entertainment. The celebration was a block away but we did not hear any noise. His location provided a lot of guilt free happy hour bar hopping. :-) Lots of good restaurants within walking distance. \n\nGarage - Covered parking and included with the fee. No extra/hidden fees. This is such a rarity in this area. The cheapest I had found when I was doing my research was $20-25 per day. Most places will do valet. His is FREE!!\n\nApartment - extremely clean. We were pleasantly surprised. The condominium is not one of the high rise ones and his unit is on the second floor but nevertheless, there is an elevator. Basic amenities are provided. He even let us borrow his snorkeling equipment. \n\nThe best thing about the apartment is not the place BUT the host. He has been so accommodating of me and my bf. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. He would email me every couple of days to check if we need anything and I also had his mobile number, just in case. I think we were lucky to book his place because most of the time he is always booked so if you have an opportunity to rent out his condominium, GO FOR IT.

Parking can be difficult in Honolulu so having a free parking space was a definite plus.

Parking in this part of Oahu can be crazy so the parking amenity was a life saver and the actual condo was cute and spacious for two!

Jiawen and Ivan were friendly hosts, with great travel tips and stories to share. Their live-in helper made us breakfast each day, which we enjoyed on the lovely rooftop terrace. \n\nTheir home was clean and comfortable and our bedroom was quiet and had everything we needed. We didn’t have a problem sharing a bathroom with the student who rented another bedroom. \n\nWe are dog owners who enjoy animals, but the two large dogs Max and Mae were unpredictable. Sometimes we were their friends, and sometimes they barked and growled at us. \n\nThe surrounding area was beautiful, with green mountains and a little river that runs through the village. Marina Cove was a 10 minute walk, and it had a grocery store, a 7-11 and a coffee shop. From there, a 10 minute bus ride got us to Sai Kung, which has a large variety of restaurants. \n\nThis is a great place to stay if you want to explore the Sai Kung peninsula. We took a cab to Sai Kung pavilion, up in the mountains, and we went on an amazing 10k hike to beaches and a river with a swimming hole. It is also perfect for people visiting HKUST, which is easily accessible by minibus. \n\nWe recommend Jiawen and Ivan’s place, especially if you are willing to adapt to dogs and want an escape from the hustle and bustle of the big city."},{"_id":"214145396","date":{"$date":"2017-11-25T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8263542","reviewer_id":"117435849","reviewer_name":"小易","comments":"好喜欢家文家里的超胖猫咪Smudge｡交通也便利｡家里很安静､舒适｡超清洁｡"},{"_id":"216032566","date":{"$date":"2017-12-03T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8263542","reviewer_id":"160040123","reviewer_name":"Youping","comments":"房东家文热情好客,给人很舒服的感觉｡"},{"_id":"217640348","date":{"$date":"2017-12-10T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8263542","reviewer_id":"159801838","reviewer_name":"航宇","comments":"一个很温馨的住处,晚上在天台上赏月是件很享受的事｡"},{"_id":"229135477","date":{"$date":"2018-01-22T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8263542","reviewer_id":"161771569","reviewer_name":"Shenqi","comments":"房东很好沟通,耐心解答和帮助房客所需……"},{"_id":"241923426","date":{"$date":"2018-03-11T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8263542","reviewer_id":"76920567","reviewer_name":"Holly","comments":"很多巴士去西贡码头｡我们住一晚去麦里浩径,正常是没有早餐,但是家文很贴心的给准备了早餐,给装了一瓶水｡房子干净,安静｡"},{"_id":"246230690","date":{"$date":"2018-03-25T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8263542","reviewer_id":"149574049","reviewer_name":"婉婷","comments":"特别棒的入住体验,好可爱的猫咪,去西贡码头吃了特别好吃的海鲜,下次还来｡"},{"_id":"248197372","date":{"$date":"2018-03-31T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8263542","reviewer_id":"179472082","reviewer_name":"Ying","comments":"房东非常nice,房间很整洁,装修很温馨"},{"_id":"259401491","date":{"$date":"2018-05-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8263542","reviewer_id":"145272371","reviewer_name":"婉莹","comments":"在那里,相机镜头里看到的是别样风景:青山､菜园､小径､溪流､遛狗､游鱼､飞蝶……让人怀疑:这是香港吗?女主人周到的服务还是挺暖心的｡他们家的狗狗不是什么名种,在别人家是弃物,而在他们家成了宠物｡能把动物视为宝的人,肯定也能把你视为宝!"},{"_id":"262755592","date":{"$date":"2018-05-10T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8263542","reviewer_id":"16366441","reviewer_name":"Jennifer","comments":"Recommended place to stay!

Hay un portero durante la semana y 2 puertas para seguridad.  Xavier era un buen anfitrion y nos ayudo con cualquier cosa necesitamos.  El mejor!!!!!\r\n\r\nThe best!  The view is incredible!  We didn't want to leave.  The space is 2 blocks from the metro, 2 blocks from the Sagrada Familia, but it was not too loud still.  You are only a few blocks from the Gracia neighborhood.  The space was very comfortable and we were able to cook, work and relax.  The terrace was our favorite place to read and look at the church.  The place is perfect for 1 or 2 people but my parents stayed for 5 days and it was still fine.  There are lots of restaurants and markets nearby.

The pictures, in my opinion, completely undersell how nice of an apartment this is. The view is spectacular, and the neighborhood is *just* far away from the tourism of the Sagrada Familia that it's nice and quiet. Further, you're close enough that you can look out the window at the incredible structure each morning. The apartment itself is well equipped, and having a washer and a dryer is fantastic. Xavier made me feel very welcomed, and worked with me on my check out time, which was very early in the morning.

There was plenty of storage and wardrobe space to hang my clothes. I had my own bathroom with a walk in shower that was amazingly hot and powerful.  There is WiFi throughout, a kitchen for cooking meals and a lovely lounge area to relax in and watch TV. The apartment itself is situated just off Glebe Point Road with at least 3 buses running directly to the city centre and beaches. Get an Opal card and use the buses which stop at the end of the road. The apartment was really quiet with no outside noise. The hosts were in contact throughout if I needed help or advice and provided travel books and handy tourist information that I used to get about.

I was totally relaxed after the initial communication with her, she is very kind and warm, she kept on informing me what necessary matters, even including parking. \n\nWhen I arrived in front of her house, which is right behind the historical Valhalla cinema at Glebe, my eyes wildly opened, her place is sitting in an old-style building with a beautiful garden, a nice bobbling fountain. \n\nShe met me and lead to my place, when I stepped in the room, my jaws fell on the ground and it took me a few minutes to pick them up and closed. In a big room, sits a nice iron-framed bed, the bedding looks like an oil painting, very artistic. The space is much more bigger than I would expect. The owner hearted prepare fruits, snacks and even bottled water, that is so touched, everyone who lives in Sydney would know drinking water is not an issue at all, however she prepares the bottled water, when she realized that I drink more water, she prepared jags of them, you know what, she even used the food wrapper to cover it. \n\nThe independent bathroom is also big, she would clean it up everyday, when you step in it, it looks like it isn't being used at all, there is no a drop of water on the glass door, mirror, or wherever you would think it would be.\n\nBoth her husband and herself are super nice to the guest, even though I am a horrible one, hardly communicate with them, except basic greetings. How terrible I am. The night before I go back to China, both of them prepared a farewell dinner for me, but I bailed, you can see how a terrible guest I am. \n\nHer location is wonderful, next to Glebe point road, It's easy to walk around the neighbourhood, beautiful cafes, restaurants, stores and bus stops are within two minutes walking distance. \n\nHer place is so beautiful, I would wake up in the birds' singing every morning, sometimes, her cute house cat would come and greet you.\n\nStay at her place is a wonderful experience, like staying at home…this would carve in my brain for a long long time."},{"_id":"209748955","date":{"$date":"2017-11-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8277472","reviewer_id":"117022589","reviewer_name":"Gwen","comments":"Great location, very comfortable accommodation, own bathroom!

He was there to greet us upon arrival and was easy to contact during our stay. He provided us with some info on the public transit, a list of his favorite spots, and some great music too! The apartment is simple, neat, and clean with plenty of amenities. It is located in a quintessential Montreal Neighborhood with manageable parking around the corner. Be sure not to park right in front (Hutchinson), it is resident only and we got a parking ticket within 20 minutes because it's parking-by-permit only. Around the corner there is pay by space parking and some other free spots. We used Uber and our car to get around but the metro is close and seems very manageable.

There was a glitch on Airbnb's side and William worked with them to correct the problem within a few hours.  I never had to wait long for a response to any of my questions.

It was idyllic; tastefully decorated and comfortably furnished and with a lovely pool and outside lounging area which is totally private thanks to the landscaping of the garden.  There is also an upstairs sunbathing and eating deck where we had dinner under the stars a number of times.  A lot of thought has gone into equipping the place; there are beach towels, deck chairs and body boards to take along to the beautiful Waimanalo beach which is literally a 100 yards walk away.  There is a huge washing machine and dryer which we made use of throughout our stay.  The kitchen was extremely well equipped; being English we wanted to make tea and the only thing we couldn't find was a kettle.  We mentioned this to Gilles and a couple of hours later he arrived with one for us.  We absolutely loved our stay there and will miss the peace and the sound of the waterfall in the pool.  We'll also miss the lovely birds that came into the garden, including some small chickens! The Waimanalo area is not well served by restaurants (unless you like burger chains), so we rarely ate out, but there is a  small local supermarket two miles up the road and a larger Safeway store a couple of miles further on.  Gilles made it clear that we only had to phone him if we needed anything, but at the same time he was completely unobtrusive as a host and we thought that was a really good balance.  We did contact him a couple of times for advice about things like taxis, and he always responded quickly.  All in all a great stay in a lovely home that we would recommend to anyone.

The place was clean and spacious - we had more than enough space to fit our group. We loved having dinner in the kitchen area then having dessert and a swim over in the lanai. The morning views - AMAZING. You step outside and there is a breathtaking view of the mountain side. There are little lizards and one got into the house - but no big deal, it is Hawaii after all. This place is a little bit of a drive to a big city, but it was totally fine being away from that scene.But if you did want to drive, the drive was filled with beautiful scenery.

They have boogie boards, snorkling equipment, beach chairs, beach towels, and the ladies made me mention- even makeup remover!  You can't even get that in a fancy hotel.  We so enjoyed \"living\" in Hawaii for the week.  Because with this home you felt your time was spent relaxing and living- not just visiting.  My sons really loved the pool and they swam in it every morning and evening.  The outdoor lanai is a great place to sit and socialize or just hang out.  There are Sonos speakers outside and inside to play your music.  The propane grill came in handy a few nights which I loved!  Every room was decorated so nicely as well-It felt like we were the very first people to ever stay in the home.  We really enjoyed every part of our visit and hope to return someday soon.

The house is great and met all of our needs.  My elderly parents, my sister, and my family of four stayed at this house for 8 days and never felt cramped. \n\nThe pool is amazing, especially if you have kids, and Waimanalo is a great location to stay at. Kailua is 15 minutes drive away and offers a ton of great restaurant and shopping options. \n\nThere's really so much great things that can be said for this property and management team it's hard to capture it all. \n\nThe only negative we have to share is concerning the bed frame in the master bedroom. Within minutes of arriving my 70 year old father tripped and fell onto the tile floor after hitting his shin on the corner of the frame when he was walking in from the master bathroom.  Luckily he was not seriously hurt. Three other people hit their shins on the very same corner of the bedframe and have bruises to show for it.  \nAnyway, this did not detract from our overall experience at all but just wanted future vacationers to have a courtesy heads up.  We all agree this property and manager deserve a 5 star rating and we definitely would stay here again on our next vacation to Oahu.

When I first arrived to check in, Jason greeted me with a big smile! He showed me around the house and provided us with menus, maps, guides, two sets of keys and the wifi information.\r\n\r\nWe were provided with fresh and clean sets of towels. Ms. Doreen dropped by the second week to provide us with a fresh set of sheets/bedding and rolls of toilet paper (which was much appreciated)! She's an absolute sweetheart! There was one day where she was around and heard my friend coughing from the outside and she came back later in the day to bring him cough syrup and cough drops! \r\n\r\nThe apartment felt like home as it included everything that you'd possibly need to survive in a typical home (ex: knives, forks, spoons, cutting boards, pots, pans, plates, cups, bowls, etc) and it made cooking easy! Under the kitchen sink, there were tons of cleaning supplies, trash bags and whatever else you may possibly need! It definitely is a testament to how clean the home is! Though this might seem minuscule, there was a separation of trash bags for recycled items and actual trash which I thought was great! Jason also provided us with snacks and a clean fridge full of bottled water!\r\n\r\nAlthough we did not use the closet, there was a ton of closet space with hangers! We used the drawers instead and even that itself was enough for all of our clothing! The bathroom was clean, there was a hair dryer, pack of toilet paper and air freshener! Though there is only one restroom, it was super convenient to have two doors, one from the bedroom and one from the kitchen/common area, to access the same bathroom which could be both locked from the inside.\r\n\r\nThe location makes grocery shopping, traveling and eating very convenient as it is surrounded by several restaurants, grocery markets/delis and is less than a 2-3 minute walk from the nearest subway station. \r\n\r\nI would recommend this listing 100% and this was my first airbnb experience!

After what seemed like forever I found this lovely place. JASON saved our family vacation!!! With his opening and accepting our booking so late in advance (less than 24 hours) we were able to spend the rest of our trip feeling safe. The place was wonderful, open and clean. We appreciated the full kitchen and was able to cook dinner for our family each night. Jason is a great host and I would recommend him to family and friends if they are ever in the area.

The only problem we had was the insulation of some of the windows. Jason attached airconditioning mashines' pipes through the windows and that leaves some holes which disturbs the insulation of the house. Although it is not a big factor for people staying in summer or warmer months,it could be a problem during winter. I can say that the heaters are working quite good,but the windows may be checked for better insulation.\n\nJason is a great host. He is a very welcoming man.

Lägenheten ligger nära tunnelbana och buss och man tar sig lätt till övriga delar av New York. Vi hittade många trevliga ställen lokalt också. På kvällen kan vi dock rekommendera att man åker taxi eller alltid är i sällskap när man tar sig hemåt.

The photos on the website don’t do it justice - the actual house is mind-blowing! The view from his house is incredible, his treehouse is phenomenal, he has a fully equipped gym, a keyboard \u0026 drumset - just everything about his house is perfect. Sitting outside with a couple of beers and looking over into Honolulu/Waikiki during the sunset was a breathtaking experience - something that no hotel can provide. Jose and his family (and his cute little dog) are very respectful, and provided us with everything that we needed. The location is great (10 minute car ride to Waikiki), and the neighborhood is beautiful. It was almost a shame that we had so many things planned outside of the home, and we wished we could’ve stayed longer. It was an honor to be able to stay at his home even just for a few days - not many times in your life would someone be willing to share their beautiful home with strangers and be so accommodating. For anyone coming to Oahu, I highly recommend staying at this property; it will most definitely enhance your experience. Thank you Jose for being such a great host - I hope our paths cross again in the future!"},{"_id":"220761207","date":{"$date":"2017-12-23T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8341415","reviewer_id":"112560378","reviewer_name":"Jon","comments":"Beautiful location with great views over Honolulu.

All in all, the house was very spacious and pleasant to stay in (Website hidden by Airbnb) The house is also located in the city of Honolulu, but it is far enough that there is not much city noise. The location was very convenient for us as we were able to go into the city fairly easily as well as travel to other parts of the island with ease (Website hidden by Airbnb) My family and I enjoyed the stay here, and Jose was an excellent host. Jose not only cares about his house, but he also cares about his guests. He provided us beach towels and boards for when we went to the beach, and he also respected our privacy.

However Istiklal Ave is very close and convenient to get to locations if you enjoy walking around.

We opened a window and turned on the de-humidifier that was in the room, but it did little to get rid of the smell. The shower is only a showerhead over the toilet, however, it provided plenty of hot water. We used Airbnb for our entire two week vaction and this was the only one we had a bad experience at. We left early the next morning and did not get a chance to explore the neighborhood, however, we can’t recommend this room to future renters. Erdal did keep in touch with us and responded quickly regarding our concerns about the protests in Taksim square, however, she will use your e-mail for communication and we were receiving multiple e-mails a day from her and that became somewhat overwhelming as well.

If mold/mildew bothers you, you probably don't want to stay here.  It probably has to do with the fact that the drain in the bathroom is not at the low point of the floor.  There's a squeegee type thing in the bathroom which would make it easy to push the water in the drain, except that there's a bumpy sticky mat right in the middle of the floor that holds all the water and makes it impossible to move water to the drain.  You can tell this bothered me a little bit.  But!  Aside from musty smell and permanently wet bathroom floor, the place was clean and the price was fairly good.  If those two downsides don't bother you, then it definitely could be worthwhile.  Although there's only one burner, the kitchen is wonderfully well stocked."},{"_id":"5126276","date":{"$date":"2013-06-14T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"836433","reviewer_id":"3940875","reviewer_name":"Gerard","comments":"During our 3 week tour of Eastern Europe using Airbnb for housing, my girlfriend and I were least impressed with our stay here. To be fair, the place did look as it did in the photos and the communication and check in were second to none in professionalism. The reasons we were left unimpressed was because of the alleyway where trash was scattered around, the musty interior, and the shower and squeegee situation other reviewers have described. In addition, my girlfriend and I kept waking up in the morning with insect bites and found a roach in the sheets. We spent three nights here and never quite felt comfortable. As I said before, there were definitely positives such as the communication and very detailed information and tips the host gave us before the trip.

They are really professional hosts. They sent me a lot of useful information about Istanbul, it was really a great present, thank you! The apartment was incredible tiny, it's in fact a room with a kitchenette and a bathroom. It was a surprise but it wasn't a problem because we had everything we needed, the apartment was fully equipped. The bathroom is very new and nice. The bed is comfortable and we had an inusefully long blanket that was very comfortable. The house is in a good place but you need to walk a lot (it wasn't a problem for us) because the public transport is far and for the centre is better walking. There was good central heating in the flat. The apartment is clean and by night we could sleep well, there wasn't any loud noise in the neighbourhood. I recommend the flat only for sleeping but you will go to Istanbul to pass the hole day in the streets :). The description of how to reach the house and the map is a little bit misleading, it is better control the route for the house meticulously before starting off because there is another Burger King earlier in Istiklal street and we were confused. On Sundays there is a fantastic vegetable and cheese market in the next streets we found it by chance and it was really a plus.\r\n"},{"_id":"34789604","date":{"$date":"2015-06-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"836433","reviewer_id":"32820585","reviewer_name":"Simon","comments":"Aucun problème avec ce studio.

I am renting out one of the two rooms, which belongs to my mother but she's now away to the States till 24 Sept. (so the space is available till 23 Sep)","neighborhood_overview":"What Hong Kong people called \"the food street\", people often come here all the way just to try out many of these famous restaurants - a lot of korean and japanese food opened by Koreans and Japanese themselves, also hotdog, burger, Chinese \"yum cha\" restaurant, Chinese dim sum, Chinese hotpot, Hong Kong local fast food, 24-hours opened noodle shop... anything you want! A market nearby if you wish to buy ingredients and cook yourself as well. This is a neighborhood where you can find old and new blend in very well with each other - where you can find really cheap food, at the same time expensive or newly opened fusion restaurants. Of course, not only food, there are 3 supermarkets nearby, a famous Guanyin temple (good for career blessing), 10 mins walk to the habor (where people exercises in that area too)... basically it is a super convenient neighborhood in Hong Kong (not to mention how it is located in the centre of Hong Kong, just one station next to Tsim Sha Tsui, or Mongkok.","notes":"The room will only be available till 23 Sep, before my mum comes back from the States. And all the wardrobe are full, but if you need, you can always put your luggage in the living area, if you don't want to put them in your room. Female preferred. And the room can only accommodate 1  person max.","transit":"Apart from Mongkok, I would say it's probably one of the most convenient areas in Hong Kong to travel to anywhere you want to. There is a bus travelling directing from the airport to the building, a taxi station in another direction, 3 mins walk from the building, a mini-bus right at the entrance of the building, which will take you to the metro and Tsim Sha Tsui or Kowloon Tong.  Hung Hom, where the building is located, is also the area where all bus between Hong Kong Island and Kowloon side will pass by - so it is usually a 30 mins bus ride (max) from here to places like Causeway Bay and Central. Oh, and you can also travel to Hong Kong Island by ferry! If you are trying to visit the New Territories like Tuen Mun or Yuen Long for some great hike or organic farm day trip, you can take West Rail for less than an hour and you will be at your destination.  Travelling to China? The train to Shenzhen or Guangzhou starts also here at Hung Hom metro station.  And Uber has a lot of cars aroun","access":"I am renting out one of the two rooms, which belongs to my mother but she's now away to the States till 24 Sept. (so the space is available till 23 Sep). Other than that, you can use the bathroom, kitchen and living area as you wish. I will also be staying in the flat so we will be sharing the apartment during your stay. But usually I wake up and leave work from 9am and back at earliest 730 or 8pm, so it's basically your space during working hours. :) Sometimes, I may cook light dinners and if you wish to join, feel free! (not excellent cooking though...)","interaction":"I am a marketing personnel but somehow involved quite a lot in tourism (Hong Kong and China). So yes if you need any help, just let me know! I may not have time to show you around but can introduce you to some great shops, events and restaurant to visit.

Self-learned Japanese just for fun... :) Backpacker, occasionally meditate, and will eventually move from the PR field to self exploration and reconstruction + life reconstruction (to find out who you are, what do you want in life, etc.) If you also want to know more about social enterprise in Hong Kong, I may be able to share a bit.

Dirty linen, towels, ceiling fan was full of accumulated soot.  The shower was completely filled with mold and fungus. The linen and pillows smelled. The bed spread had \"stains\" and \"hair\".  Disgusting, just gross! This was my first time using Airbnb and all the reviews I read on hosts room seemed very positive. So I decided to get it.  I blame myself.... the old saying \"get what you pay for\" .  The host seemed nice enough BUT, my fiance' and I could not stay there and basically had to get a another hotel in Astoria (at an Additional cost of $800 on top of the host's of $300 + for 3 nights).  The host's room priced at $80 was not even worth $10 IMO. In New York completely \"stranded\" and looking for another Hotel... freezing cold, carrying luggage on a Friday night  while taking a 7 am flight to arrive for family and business trip.  Airbnb site is IMO not customer friendly about requesting a refund. I could not find a phone # on entire site for this kind of situation to get my refund or request some kind of resolution. I had to lookup up (Hidden by Airbnb) how to even request a refund. Basically my experience after my trip is that Airbnb expects you the renter to resolve your grievance with the host. Basically tell the host your're not happy or comfortable of the conditions of their home or room and resolve it yourselves if you can navigate around their completely complicated website when it comes to issues like mine. Basically tell hosts yourself that their house is in my case completely unacceptable  and disgusting and hopefully get a refund days later at the hosts discretion.  After messaging host which again I say seemed nice enough I got only $131 back at his discretion of fairness. I don't recommend the hosts room for anything more than last option resort rather sleeping on the street. A better option and cheaper option is renting a car and sleeping in that car if you don't get a parking ticket whilst parked overnight. If the hosts room, bed and shower are completely disgusting and can't be used than it's the same as a rented car without a shower. Everything always seems like a good idea till something goes wrong like this....then try looking on this site to find a phone # to get some kind of resolution or refund or compromise is like a puzzle within an enigma inside of a maze. Even now trying to upload pictures I took of hosts house to show other guests contemplating using host's room of actual bed sheets, bed, shower, bathroom seem impossible. Also, having to write \"required\" 500 essay or review about my experience seems like a way not wanting a guest like me to write a bad review... a way of having me shut up and take my $$$ loss without any say so and go away thanks"},{"_id":"120324516","date":{"$date":"2016-12-09T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8365172","reviewer_id":"92013206","reviewer_name":"Ararat","comments":"Probably one of the safest neighborhood in the city.Lots of Greek restaurants 3 min to N W trains.Chris is a really cool guy he works alot. you wont see him during day"},{"_id":"120928699","date":{"$date":"2016-12-12T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8365172","reviewer_id":"45803713","reviewer_name":"Kevin","comments":"Great host, great place, great location.

We also walked down to a beer garden a few blocks away. \n\nCristaino's apartment is perfectly quaint \u0026 secure for 2 people. Exactly what we needed for a day to explore the area.

There as a half-eaten carton of ice cream in the freezer without a lid with a plastic spoon in it.

Especially seeing that you’re a super host. However, we were very disappointed with our one night stay at Cristiano’s place. Not only was Cristiano unresponsive on the Airbnb app, but also on his person phone where I had to dig through Airbnb to find and call him. Furthermore, the condition of the place was a lot worse than we expected. Upon arrival, one of his neighbors came to us telling us someone broke into their place and flipped all their furnitures over. We felt unsafe literally the second we arrived to the place. What made it worst was when we found that the windows couldn’t even lock at Cristiano’s apartment. We ended up leaving our valuables in the car. In addition, there was left over food in the fridge, the door was broken in one the bedrooms, and the floor was extremely dirty. We could feel a thick layer of dust on the floor if we took off our shoes. The bed sheets also felt uncleaned and itchy to sleep on.  Overall it was a very  disappointing experience and I would not recommend anyone to stay there. I don’t usually like to leave made reviews but I do not want anyone to make the same mistake as us , thinking ‘Superhost’ would make a person/place more trustworthy."},{"_id":"319941988","date":{"$date":"2018-09-07T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8365172","reviewer_id":"131385928","reviewer_name":"Nicole","comments":"I would most definitely recommend this home.

Before arrival Jo was so helpful in sending through information in what could be done in the immediate surrounding area.\n\nDue to time restraints we couldn’t do everything but we certainly had a go at and discovered some little gems we other wouldn’t have known about.\n\nThe place itself was cosy and had a lovely warmth to it. Everything that we expected for our stay was met and exceeded. The accommodation of an early check in given the long flight in was especially appreciated.\n\nHighly recommended.

Nice to have two bathrooms though.\nIt is up a very steep hill in one of Sydney’s suburbs . You do need a car but you can walk to the main road to get buses etc. We were there over a heatwave at New year and being a top floor unit, it was very warm. There are fans but no A/C.

It's a real house where Joanna lives, so you really get the feeling of being in your home and not on holiday. There are tons of objects and arts (mostly paintings) everywhere, it's also possible to visit the art studio, if you love arts, you definitely have to pay a visit, it's definitely interesting.\r\nJoanna is a great host, always replying to every e-mail and message. We had a huge delay with our flight, due to bad weather in Europe, and she was so kind to wait for us until late night, even if she had to leave for the countryside. She also helped us to stop 2 taxis in the street to get to the airport on our last day, very kind of her!\r\nOn the negative sides, being a huge and very old house, full of tons of personal objects, books and arts, it's also dusty and cleanliness is not up to Italian standards, but, then again it's an historic brownstone building not a new built house, so we were expecting something like that. \r\nA tip for Italian people only, beware that, as usual in foreign countries, there's no bidet in the bathrooms!"},{"_id":"11392373","date":{"$date":"2014-04-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"840731","reviewer_id":"1119572","reviewer_name":"Dermot","comments":"There is only one place to stay in New York, and that is in this beautiful home.

So much to see and do, all well within walking distance, and the pedestrian traffic density is just enough to allow one to move to and fro effortlessly and with great comfort, even well after the shows and theatres have let out for the evening.\n\nDining experiences of all types abound, many close at hand or a short cab or train ride away, or hit the local markets (there are many to chose from) and make a feast to share with family and friends. Joanna's is well equipped to host a dinner party which we did (our first in NY) - sharing a wonderful evening with old friends and new. \n\nAll that it's described in her bio on her home is spot on and the photos do not do it justice. This is a well lived, well loved, oasis that will provide all the space and amenities one could ever need to experience life in New York.

The location was fabulous, right next door to one of the best cafes for coffee in NY. It was within walking distance of so many great areas ( Greenwich Village, Soho, Chelsea Markets, Little Italy etc) and provided easy access to two subway stations. We loved the fresh green market at Union Square and the numerous food stores minutes from the house. Joanna was prompt in responding to our initial enquiry and then all subsequent communication.

We enjoyed exploring the neighbourhood and especially the Union Square market with all its wonderful produce. Subway and bus stops were nearby making it easy to venture around Manhattan and beyond.\r\nThe house is a home, filled with objects from Joanna's life there since the late 1970s and the style of the home reflects her interest in art and the environment and felt a little like you might be in one of Woody Allen's films from the 80s (think Hannah and her Sisters). Family photos, paintings and books lined the walls and the kitchen was equipped for serious cooking.  The upstairs bedroom had a very comfortable bed, the second bedroom is a study with a pull out bed that would be fine for a short stay - that both rooms had their own bathrooms was very convenient and allowed us to feel quite self contained. \r\nThe weekend we stayed was a long weekend and there was a lot of noise in the street all night. Joanna has said she will provide ear plugs for her guests use in future and this will make a difference for anyone who hasn't adjusted to the hustle and bustle of NYC.

Plenty of first rate grocery, shopping and dining options within walking distance and close to a major subway station. Great coffee house next door too. Joanna had a last minute mix-up with arranging for someone to get us a key but it was straightened out with plenty of good communication by the time we arrived. This is our second Airbnb experience in NYC. The first place in Chelsea last year was great. This one was disappointing. First, Joanna runs a business from her residence and one of the employees has a key. Unknown to us, he apparently expects to be able to come by to pick up the mail. Joanna neglected to tell us about this (or even ask if this was ok) until I was at Whole Foods and got a text message from her that her employee was standing on the doorstep about to enter (apparently assuming the apartment was empty—it wasn’t; my wife and daughter happened to hear him outside talking on the phone; not knowing who he was or why he was there, they didn't respond to his repeated ringing of the doorbell). This was a very upsetting experience. If they had not overheard him telling someone he was going to use his key to go in and then taken it upon themselves to open the door and hand him the mail, it was clear he would have entered the apartment with his key on his own—imagine if you were in the bathroom or some other part of the residence and someone just walked in? Second, the unit was not clean. My wife had to scrub down the handles and top of the stove as well as the kitchen counters before being able to prepare and cook any meals. Likewise, the kitchen table (covered with small tiles) was filthy and had to be scrubbed before we could eat there. The kitchen chairs have wicker seats that are well-worn and not very sturdy (and there are several of the same chairs in the entry hallway with seats that have actually fallen through). The kitchen floor needed a good scrubbing (which we just had to ignore) and there was a film of grease throughout the kitchen walls and cabinets and on the pots and pans that were stored outside the cabinets. The bathrooms were not any better as far as cleanliness was concerned. The shower in the downstairs bathroom is only about 5.5 feet high and doesn’t adjust so if you are taller than that, taking a shower is a real challenge. Thankfully the weather was great as there is only central heating and it doesn’t appear that there is any air conditioning (a window unit is stored on the floor of the closet in the downstairs bedroom so perhaps Joanna pulls that out when summer arrives and A/C is needed). Lastly, Joanna wants her guests to follow her rules about trash, recycling and composting which are fine..."},{"_id":"153287622","date":{"$date":"2017-05-20T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"840731","reviewer_id":"37988117","reviewer_name":"John","comments":"We could not have been happier with this home.

Adequate for solo traveller who is budget conscious.  TST is great location to stay in and Metro entrance is just downstairs, many bus stops near by and ferry terminal within 10 mins walking distance.  Recommend future visitors to go across the road and check out the lovely Kowloon park.  It has swimming pool, bird aviary and MacDonald offering nice coffee and breakfast.  Great place for breakfast and a relief from the pace and crowd of TST.  All in all, this accommodation is good value for the budget traveller."},{"_id":"52114103","date":{"$date":"2015-10-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8414008","reviewer_id":"24890491","reviewer_name":"Cheng-Ming","comments":"房東人很親切, 房間有點小, 但設備還ok, 算符合性價比\r\n地理位置很棒, 在尖沙嘴站一出來就是了, 樓下有小熊餅乾, 對要買的人來說很方便.

It is extremely close to the MTR and the harbour, there are nice restaurants and cafes in the area, and the building feels relatively safe with night guards and such. It is really good value compared to other places that are located that centrally in HK. Also, my tiny room had its own tiny toilet and shower. \nHowever, if you’re planning to stay for a bit longer than a night or two, you might want to pay a little more and stay somewhere nicer, as there was  no window and it felt slightly claustrophobic at times. Also, the room I stayed in had moldy walls, which concerned me as I was staying for several nights (but otherwise clean!)."}]}

We finally found it and waited and it didn't work, NO HOT WATER. We immediately contacted her inquiring about the switch and letting her know it wasn't working, and had no response until after we checked out with just saying \"sorry, yes that was the right switch\", we had to shower with COLD water for three days, we didn't pay what we paid for cold water showers, that was a total scam and she was very uncooperative (from very quick responses during check in process to complete radio salience once we raised the hot water issue) and rejected any request for refund despite acknowledging that she didnt provide us with hot water.

The thoughtful host makes available pretty much everything you might need. The condo is located right in the heart of Kailua-Kona, so it's an easy walk to the \"King Kam\" hotel and the restaurants and shops around there, as well as the large commercial hub to the south along the water. We were in the area to Scuba dive; it's a drive of less than 15 minutes to the harbor. You have a guaranteed parking spot. There was a big parade in town during our stay, and to get to the main street you just walk out of your condo, take the elevator, walk a bit, turn left, walk a short city block past the farmer's market, and then you're on the main street. If you happen to be some idiot who loses the room key in the harbor - don't ask - the owner has a plan for that and we were back in the unit in no time. The kitchen is very functional, and other reviews sum up the rest, good Wi-Fi, AC, icemaker, etc. In summary, this place is as good as it gets.

The host was responsive to our calls and quick to show up, if we needed something.  The location is close to Kahala mall and has good access to areas near Diamond Head, plus quick access to the freeway. The living room is large with nice couches, and we enjoyed the airy, bright space it had. There is a new large-screen TV and good wifi access.\r\nThings we would like to see improved:\r\n1) The images portrayed on the website show more lamps and furniture than were present in the rooms.  Now there are only ceiling lights associated with the fans, and this limits lighting in the rooms. We could not read in our bedrooms.\r\n2) There is no indoor table for meals, and there appeared to be one on the website photos.  We did eat some meals on the outdoor lanai (deck), but we had hoped for a dining area indoors, as pictured on the website.\r\n3) There are two bedrooms with sliding doors that lack screens. Therefore. those bedrooms cannot have the sliders left open for airflow without risking having bugs fly into the house. Without cross-ventilation, the rooms can be hot and stuffy, even with the ceiling fans.\r\n4) The house is old, and we noticed ants and cockroaches in the front room, kitchen and master bath."},{"_id":"77163823","date":{"$date":"2016-05-30T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8427787","reviewer_id":"20744210","reviewer_name":"Aidett","comments":"Away from the hustle and bustle of the tourist areas but a close drive to them, i do believe that this was possibly the best air bnb that I could have booked for my parents, grandparents, brother and sister-in-law! My family was in town for 5 nights for my wedding and this, being their first time in Hawaii, I wanted to make them as comfortable as possible. The house had the perfect amount of space for my 6 guests with (possibly the best part of the house) a wrap around balcony overlooking Diamond Head and the ocean. The location of the house is in the hills, which makes it very peaceful and my family spent every night grilling and sitting on the balcony together listening to the birds and nature all around. I'm pretty sure that at least one person slept outside on this great balcony each night! The house was impeccably clean and had well kept furniture and appliances. To keep costs low, my family cooked as much as possible at the house and they found everything they needed in the kitchen. The house does not have AC but it was not needed, even during a particularly hot and humid week. The wind blew through the house nicely and there were also plenty of ceiling fans to circulate air. \n\nKaiser, our host, was very gracious and made himself available to contact during our stay but since my family was not in need of anything, we did not have to contact him. He greeted us the day we arrived, showed us around and said goodbye on the departure day. \n\nThis house is great for families who want some R\u0026R and/or to keep costs low by cooking at home.  I will certainly be recommending this air bnb to anyone who has a larger group coming to town and do hope that my family can stay here again. It truly was paradise! Mahalo to Kaiser for sharing his home and making it a comfortable and memorable experience for my beloved family!"},{"_id":"85495429","date":{"$date":"2016-07-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8427787","reviewer_id":"42850585","reviewer_name":"Matthew","comments":"We really enjoyed staying here. The lanai was beautiful (views of both the ocean and Diamond Head) and the time I spent out there was one of the high points of my trip. At first I didn't like the rather steep roads up to the house, but we all realized that being so high meant that it was cool at night--we visited relatives at a beachside rental house and it was too hot with no breeze. Although it was 90 degrees during the day, it was cool at night with lovely breezes. There are ceiling fans in all the rooms and that keeps everything cool. Everything was very clean, not a bug in sight (although I expect to see bugs in Hawaii, no matter how clean the house is). There were six of us so we were worried about having one shower (there are two bathrooms but one shower), but it turned out not to be an issue at all. Kaiser met us when we checked in and showed us around. The location is great because you are 10 minutes from Kahala Mall and Whole Foods, 15 minutes away from Ala Moana and Waikiki, and 15 minutes from the airport.

This was a booking that I made less than 48 hours from my scheduled arrival. I have been using this AIRBNB service now for 3 years, so I would like to think I’m pretty familiar with how things work. The raised eyebrows began when Carlos sent me a text message outside of AirBnB directly from a cell phone number to my cell phone number the day of check in requesting that I send him a picture of my US ID or Passport, as it is needed for self-check in. Again, since I have reserved with several hosts in the past who only did self-check in and never was asked this, I immediately asked him, “Do you not have a copy of my ID from the AIRBNB App?” I then told him to send all requests to me directly on AirBNB so I can have proper documentation of communication with the host. His response regarding why he needs a picture of my ID/or Passport is:    “ We require to have a valid US ID or Passport on file for all of our guest. This is our policy here in NYC as well as other properties I have in Asia \u0026 South America. NYC law requires that we have a valid ID on file for anyone getting keys to the property. Further this requirement is noted on our listing description. I understand you submitted ID to your AIRBNB profile; however that is for AIRBNB, not for us. AIRBNB is the system processing the reservation; not the owner of the property; me as the owner of the property also need valid ID on file.”   After his spill I proceeded to take a picture of my State ID, and forwarded it to him. He immediately responded stating that he would give the me self-check in instructions “SHORTLY”….which was around 2p est.  Around 8p EST still no self-check in instructions, at this point, I’m feeling uneasy about this guy as he claims to be such a professional with this Airbnb business bragging about all the properties he has worldwide, yet he doesn’t follow through on sending me check in instructions after he demanded I send him a picture of my personal information (ID). When I inquired with him about the check in information at 8pm that night, this man had the nerve to respond to me and say, “ your flight hasn’t even arrived yet” and he proceeded to send me a screen shot of my flight’s current status. At this point I’m irritated because now you’re just holding the information hostage, I don’t care if I said I wasn’t going to be arriving til 10pm, I paid for a check in of 3p, check out of 11a, therefore I should have had check in instructions within 24 hours of my paid check in time of 3pm OR at least immediately after I sent my photo ID. After I told mentioned to him how his process sounded fishy, he then responded bragging about how he has all of these properties and to read his great reviews on AIRBNB. Now to the good part when I arrived to the unit….I messaged Carlos via AIRBNB letting him know I gained access to the unit.  Now the cleanliness…first of all the hallway area, up to the stairway, to the front door of the unit is completely disgusting full of dog/cat hair. The pictures over exaggerate the size of the alleged “master” bedroom, the bed takes up 97% of the floor space in the “master” room. The TV mounted on the wall did not work at all, and I sent Carlos 2 messages asking him what was up with the TV, and how can I get it to work (within 30 minutes of when he acknowledged my access to his property). Surprisingly Carlos being a #1 rated host throughout the world did not respond….last form of communication through the duration of my stay was his acknowledgement that I gained access to his unit. He didn’t provide check out instructions. Oh and the bathroom, completely disgusting more so the shower/tub. I paid an inflated New Year’s season rate, so I really got played on this one.

Flat is NOT in the center or any touristical place, so you you will spend time (around 30 minutes with walking) and money (3 turkish lira for each person for 1 ride) to get to another side. Last ferry is around 22 o'clock, so you will be always time limited to go by it back home. But there is also (more far!) metro, what is also reachable.

No view to speak of, but you do feel that you are immersed in Rio life, particularly when you hang out the window and watch a Carnaval bloco going past .. fun!!!\r\n\r\nMonica was wonderful and very flexible and accommodating with our requests.  We had a few problems on arrival and Monica attempted to remedy them straight away even though we were smack in the middle of Carnaval and Copacabana was pretty much at gridlock.  She even posted some electrical adaptors to me that I had left behind - very helpful.\r\n\r\nThe apartment is only small, but large enough for a couple to move around comfortably.  Tidy little kitchen area and clean clean clean apartment. It is not what you would call a luxurious apartment however very much value for money.

Monica went above all my expectations for my first rental on airbnb.com.

She was also flexible on the check-in and out times which is important for travelers.  The apartment was spotless and EXTREMELY clean.  I highly recommend staying here over any other option in Rio during your stay (flexible check-in/out, clean, and prime location). Monica made the apartment feel like our home.  You are just a short walk from Copacabana post 5 and can easily walk to post 9 if you wish.  We walked everywhere and didn’t need to take the metro (Still closed).  We found a great salgado stop for a quick breakfast or lunch before hitting the beach or sugar loaf right down the street from the apartment.  You simply walk out the front door towards Avenue Atlantica and one block prior on the left hand side before crossing the street you will find awesome salgados for only R$3.00.  If you turn right here, a couple blocks down on the left you will find an awesome takeout restaurant as well and one meal feeds two Americans at R$15.00!  Note that Monica speaks excellent English for those of you that don’t speak Portuguese.

She greeted us when we arrived which was later than we expected, showed us into the apartment and made us feel completely at ease. The apartment is very nice - clean and functional with a modern kitchen and amenities. We loved the neighborhood. There is a Metro stop literally right out the door and we were just three blocks from Copacabana  which is everything you have seen and heard ---wonderful to walk and enjoy whiling away your days, swimming, sunning and people watching. It is also an easy walk to Ipanema with eclectic neighborhoods and famous beach.  Every morning we would walk to a coffee shop where we got to know the sweet little girl who served us and have a delicious espresso or cappuccino with a ham and egg breakfast and fresh orange juice. A great shopping street for clothes, shoes, bags plus plus at good prices. Taxis were always available and all the drivers know Monica's street and the apartment location. She was there to meet us when it was time to leave and we have nothing but good memories of our stay in Rio. Thank you Monica. A Happy New Year and good things always.\r\n\r\nJulie and Michael"},{"_id":"9404289","date":{"$date":"2013-12-27T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"846689","reviewer_id":"9571547","reviewer_name":"Giovanni","comments":"In one word: AMAZING!!!!!\r\n\r\nAbout...\r\n\r\nMONICA: she was so helpful and clear since our first contact by mail/sms.

She refounded us cause TV was not working normally (even if not necessary but sth appreciated and very nice of her).\r\n\r\nSTUDIO: the studio is absolutely well located, just between Copacabana and Ipanema, with Metro St at the house exit, with bus stop at 200mt, with nearby shops/bars/restaurants. There are maps and many important info in brochures. We found the flat very clean, bed/bathroom/kitchen are perfect as you can see from the pictures.\r\n\r\nRIO: it's big, multicultural, interesting city. Not as dangerous as people say.

Bem servido por transporte público, é possível conhecer os principais pontos do Rio pegando ônibus por ali: Cristo, Pão de Açúcar, Jardim Botânico, Maracanã, centro e muitos outros . Há também um metro na porta, mas não o utilizamos. Há várias opções de restaurantes na região, para todos os gostos e bolsos.

É super bem localizado com entrada de metrô em frente do prédio, e com menos de 10 minutos a pé das duas praias (Copacabana e Ipanema). Mónica já escreveu uma guia para quem interessa com dicas bastante uteis. Não tenho reclamações, não. Ela me recebeu pessoalmente o primeiro dia, explicou tudo e me deixou pra aproveitar da cidade. Quando tive perguntas ou duvidas ela sempre me respondeu pronto e com (Website hidden by Airbnb) certeza vou ligar para ela quando voltar ao Rio. Obrigado, Mónica! / What a great experience! This was my first time in Rio and first time using Airbnb, so I was nervous, but Monica put all my fears to rest. She was really professional, very responsive and super helpful. She even printed up a guide for tourists in various languages. The apartment is just as described and presented here. It's very well-located, with the metro right outside the front gate of the building. I always felt safe. It's 10 minutes walking distance from either Copacabana and Ipanema, and any groceries you may need to buy. I don't have any complaints. Without a doubt, I'll try book with Monica next time I visit Rio.

Monica is a very professional and polite host. She told us everything you need to know for a perfect start so that you won't have any questions and if there are any you can contact her every time. The appartment is very spacious and has got a modern interior. The kitchen gots everything you need and you are able to drink water from the installed filter. To visit the beach you only need to walk 10 minutes while you are passing a supermarket, restaurants and - absolutely great - a metro station just in front of the house (it's not visible on (Hidden by Airbnb) Maps but it's the General Osorio station). From there you get to all interesting places very easy, fast and cheap. The appartment doesn't have a nice view out of the window and sometimes it's a bit loud because of the noises resounding between the houses. But if I would recommend an appartment in the center of a vibrant city than this and if I could also give stars to the host Monica would get 5 of it.

The most organised and thorough host I have ever had, what a lovely person. She really made everything so easy. Maps, guides to restaurants and local areas, suggestions all in a file! Beach umbrella, cleaning products, kitchen essentials all great.\r\nThe area is great and very convenient to get to Copacabana and Ipanema areas. Right next to a train station. It was so brilliant!\r\nMy only problem was there is no hot water in the kitchen or bathroom sinks so washing dishes and shaving were difficult and the shower did not get hot enough. However i think this is a Rio thing and not exclusive to this fantastic place, Thanks Monica."},{"_id":"116202245","date":{"$date":"2016-11-28T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"846689","reviewer_id":"9815165","reviewer_name":"Carlos Raul","comments":"El departamento esta impecable.

This apartment was amazing for the 5 of us, it is more like a 4 bedroom apartment rather than 2.5, as there is so much space over the 2 floors. The best things about it include the amazing interior design and furnishings, the size of the space and the proximity to Central Park that is no more than 100 yards away (the subway is about 200 yards away). The apartment also has a garden and a BBQ grill which is remarkable considering the location.\r\n\r\n My only slight worry was the stairs that were quite steep for my 2 year old but that didn't matter as we put a sofa in front of them so he couldn't access them. \r\n\r\nOur hosts, Dirk and his family and Debra Jo were amazing. They left us some cookies which my wife and kids loved and made us feel really welcome. They even lent us a wide variety of toys and scooters to play with and my daughter ended up playing with our host's kids.

If you sit there for long enough, you will forget you are living in one of the most populous cities in the world. Oh, and if you decide that the patio isn't a good enough way to escape from the city, central park is only a 5 minute walk away.

I lived in Manhattan for many years so I can appreciate the quality of the space. Nowhere can you find a duplex on the Upper West Side with this much room, and all the included amenities, for this price. It handled my family of 5 easily . The garden space out back is a real plus. The place has everything you could possibly need. It's on a quiet block just steps from Central Park and the Museum of Natural History with easy access to the subway. Great restaurants abound in the area. The physical layout was quite nice and even though it was a garden-level apartment it was completely quiet at night; no street noise to speak of, and no noise from upstairs. The design is mid-century modern, with European flair, a pretty neat combination. The bottom part of the duplex was a perfect area for my 13 year-old to commandeer  as it is set off from the main area by a cool metal staircase. There is a 1/2 bath on the lower level and a nicely sized full bath on the first floor. Appliances were all relatively new and in good working order. \n\nI appreciatethe fact that the apartment is on a residential block of lovely brownstones; there is a real neighborhood feel to the UWS and its easy to slip into the day-to-day routines of the block. We live nearby on Long Island and spent three days here while some work was being done at our house. We will definitely be back on future occasions when we need a dose of Manhattan.\n\nDirk was very responsive to any inquiry I had about the space.

The next morning it turned out that the shower water was not draining properly. A quick call and a couple hours later it got fixed! Perfect! Only negative thing I can say is regarding the hotel itself. We asked whether we could store our luggage for a couple hours before heading to the airport and they said no because we were not registered guests. Same thing with borrowing a broom, beach chairs or making use of the free shuttle to Ala Moana. A little bit frustrating, but nothing the host can do about this, I guess. When I contacted Mark about the beach chairs and the broom, he was happy to bring them over the next day.

It does need to be made clear that this is a private suite in a hotel building, and the hotel staff won't do much for you. We had an issue with our in room safe where is stopped responding to our code and despite admitting they had an override device, it took 4 days and many texts, conversations and visits with Mark to convince them to come in and help...and they charged us $50 to do it!

I feel like I could have got more for my money, but it was because the building is old and smells very strong of cat urine and dead mice. The apartment itself WAS clean and true to description, but the smell was so strong, it just makes you feel dirty. \n\nAlso, there is a bit of a security issue. The front doors to the building don't lock and anyone can just walk in off the street. Then again, this is NYC, it's more common than not for old buildings have these issues because they are neglected by the owners. I lived in Harlem for 5 years and definitely experienced that before. \n\n"},{"_id":"153073125","date":{"$date":"2017-05-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"8474806","reviewer_id":"3169302","reviewer_name":"Rick","comments":"Stephens place was perfect for our stay.

They provide beach chairs, beach towels, plenty of room in the fridge for your food/beverages, and a sweet dog, Bindi, to keep you company if you wish. They're kind, thoughtful hosts, and yet allow you your privacy. They've made great updates to their home - the outdoor shower is wonderful, their yard is lovely and they're working on staining/finishing off a nice deck area as well. The room is perfect for a single traveler like myself. There was a basket filled with information on Kailua and surrounding areas, as well as amenities (toothpaste, shower gel, shampoo, etc.) I didn't do any cooking (my choice), but they have a nicely furnished kitchen. I appreciated the \"green\" choice of coffee pods for their Keurig! I loved having breakfast on their cozy, shady porch looking out over their yard edged with flowers.
