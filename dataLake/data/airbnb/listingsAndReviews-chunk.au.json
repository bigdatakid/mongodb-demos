The garden is great for having a meal or just a drink. Everything worked just as expected: the dishwasher, washing machine, and so on. Ingrid was very available and responsive and check-in and check-out were easy. I was initially a bit worried about the bars right outside but that was not an issue--they were not loud and they closed down at reasonable times. My only complaint--and it's minor and outside the control of the owner/host--is that the Metro runs right under the building and you can hear it. But that was more than compensated by the fact that the pedestrian street outside has less noise than streets with traffic would.

It's very well equipped, with all the little essentials like salt, sugar and coffee provided as well as all the crockery and cooking utensils you could need, plus other useful extras like hairdryer and sewing kit. It was spotlessly clean and in great condition, just like it looks in the photos. The beds were very comfortable, and having two bathrooms as well as the two double bedrooms was very convenient. It was really nice to be able to open the back door onto the courtyard and to sit outside to have breakfast. \r\n\r\nThe apartment is on the ground floor, with the bedrooms facing the street, so be aware that you will notice noise in the evenings, although this does quieten down overnight. The street outside is pedestrianised so the traffic noise is from a bit of a greater distance away, which helps. Yes, as other reviewers have commented, you can hear the metro going by underneath, but the rumble is quite low pitched and it wasn't that disturbing (the scooters are worse!). There are many restaurants close by and plenty of bakeries for morning pastries; also fruit and veg shops and a late-opening supermarket, all within two minutes of the front door. The Sagrada Familia is 5 minutes walk in one direction, and Sant Pau hospital 5 minutes in the other direction (also definitely worth a visit - absolutely beautiful, and less touristy). Ingrid was a great host, very accommodating even though our flight was an hour late in arriving due to thunderstorms in Barcelona. All in all a great experience and we'd definitely come back.

We cooked several meals at home (market about a block away) and found everything we needed in the kitchen. We didn't get to appreciate the courtyard due to inclement weather, but it looked lovely. Ingrid was an excellent hostess and worked hard to make our trip more enjoyable.

It's literally steps from the Sagrada Familia on a great, pedestrian-only street lined with outside tables and many bars and restaurants. The location suited us perfectly for our visit.

She was also flexible on the last day and we were able to leave our cases until 2pm which really helped as our flight was at 5.30pm. \r\n\r\nThe apartment was spacious and well equipped with really comfy beds and fabulous showers - always good. I would say the back garden needs a little tidying up/weeding to feel more welcoming. \r\n\r\nI'm a light sleeper and needed earplugs due to traffic and street noise (my partner and daughter slept fine!).

We arrived late (almost midnight) and she arranged for a transfer from the airport directly to her apartment, where she was waiting for us.  She pointed out places to buy food nearby, set us up on the private wifi, and the apartment had lots of brochures and travel tips for us.  She was very welcoming.\r\n\r\nThe apartment was centrally located and exactly as described.  Our only complaint is that the apartment is located on the first/ground floor with the bedrooms facing the street.  As such, there was a good bit of street noise at night (which is likely normal for Barcelona).  The apartment door is located off the main building entrance, so you could hear groups coming back late at night (3:00-4:00am).  The last night we stayed there, everything was quiet, so perhaps it was simply a busy weekend.  Overall, we enjoyed our stay.

The only negatives I would say is there was no shampoo, when it was listed on the profile. We grabbed shampoo from the supermarket which was extremely close, so that was not a huge deal. Make sure you are aware of the additional cleaning fee and tax that you pay in cash to her once you arrive, we thought the cleaning fee was a little high.

The apartment is well appointed and no matter how you like to make your coffee, the device is there.

Also, the metro runs under the apartment. We were there in January so the foot traffic was light and the metro noise really wasn't as bad as many hotel HVAC units.

It is located in a great area of the city - le Plateau - where you are surrounded by quiet streets for strolling, trendy bars, cafés and restaurants, and unique shopping that Montreal is known for.  We drove to Montreal and overnight street parking was readily available, once you figured out the signage and what sections of the street were non-permit.  The neighbours were also very helpful to point out when we got it wrong, saving us a potential ticket!!  Martin was nice to deal with.  Although we didn't get to meet in person, communication with him was easy - phone, text, email and thru AirBNB.  Check-in and out was easy, and we felt very safe and secure.  The apartment has an alarm system and we were introduced on paper to the upstairs neighbour, who we then met in person over the course of the weekend.  The apartment is clean and the beds are comfortable.  The  bedroom is large (king size bed) and is off the front side of the house, but the street is fairly quiet, so street noise wasn't an issue.  There is no central air conditioning, but a fan in the bedroom and portable a/c unit in the living room.  We were there on a very hot, sticky weekend, and didn't find the apartment overly hot, nor did we need the a/c.  Although well equipped, we didn't do any cooking in the kitchen, apart from making tea.  But we did prepare a nice snack of wine, cheese, crackers, meat, grapes… which we enjoyed sitting out on the quiet and sunny back deck area.  Having this outside space was very nice.  The apartment is also equipped with a washer/dryer - so handy for longer stays.  Decent shower/tub with good water pressure - there is no exhaust fan though, so the room does steam up, making it a bit hard to towel dry.  The only real quirk for us... the toilet is in a small \"closet\" at the front of the house - literally just room for the toilet - while the shower/tub/sink is in a separate room at the back of the house.  So you have to walk through the dining/living room \u0026 kitchen to wash your hands after using the toilet.  Looking back at the photos, we can see this now, but it is not obvious and was a bit of a surprise for us.  Overall though, we were very happy with the apartment.  Great price, great location, great weekend!"},{"_id":"100645669","date":{"$date":"2016-09-10T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2054110","reviewer_id":"21204064","reviewer_name":"Konstantin","comments":"The place is super cozy.

He is very communicative and available. Check-in was easy and the place is truly a zen house. I used to live in Montreal so new location was best for those wanting to live the local life but his place is truly next to everything. From wonderful brunch place less than 2 blocks away to fresh daily croissant to bars to restaurants to metro.. I can go on.\nWhen we arrived, Martin had left us personal notes about the place, with his phone number, map of the city, trash day during the week an other uselful information. We were able to find parking on the street without using parking permits but he had left us parking permits in case we needed them at a very affordable fee. The place was spotless and I felt is bigger than the pictures show. Lots of storage for your clothes as the closets are empty and ready to use. I will come back to this place next time I come back to Montreal for sure. Martin is very friendly and available and his place is wonderful. Some mentioned the toilet is a separate room than shower and sink, its true but didnt bother me. I didnt use the bbq but its a brand new big one, better than the one shown on the pictures.\nMartin's place is the best place to live the local life while staying in a stress free very quiet place next to absolutely everything. If you're into road noise, construction driving you crazy and high rises, go downtown. If you want true Montreal experience, stay at the zenhouse.\n\nThanks Martin for the wonderful hospitality and great stay!"},{"_id":"294782721","date":{"$date":"2018-07-22T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2054110","reviewer_id":"11523979","reviewer_name":"Chris","comments":"My family loved the apartment and the location.

I love the area of Volcano. It pretty much rained every night and most days but the temp was still in the 80’s. I’m from CA where it hardly ever rains so i enjoyed it. Kona Coast is 96 miles, easy day trip and back from house. Hilo and Rainbow falls just a short trip down the mountain.

Sydney is a bustling city and we're located right in the heart of it (which is part of the reasons why we love it!) so noise is inevitable. There is a construction going on from the right hand side of the complex so you might hear some noise during the day but hopefully it won’t affect you much as you’ll be exploring Sydney during daytime. This pad accommodates 4 adults comfortably but a max of 6 overnight. Any more than 4 adult guests overnight or extra sofa will attract an extra AU$30 per night, per additional guest. The sleeping arrangement for the 5th to 6th adult would be on a 2-seater sofa bed which folds out to a double with extra quilt","transit":"2 minutes walk to Central train station and bus interchange this apartment is perfectly located to get around Sydney. Leave the car and just walk everywhere! The City Centre is a 3 minute walk, Sydney Opera House 20 minutes and the Botanical Gardens 25 minutes. If you want to go further afield or just prefer public transport there are several bus stops within a 5 minute walk, which can take you around Sydney, including to Circular Quay, Bondi Beach or Centennial Park and of course you can get anywhere from Central train station. All public transport is close by. On street parking is available and the airport is literally 15 minutes away by cab or train.","access":"Everything is yours to enjoy so treat the apartment as your own. Up to 2 x Key Fob and apartment keys will be given to each party or individual to access the apartment, and I will meet you in person or make suitable arrangements if I can not make it.  FAMILY \u0026 CHILD-FRIENDLY Accommodation! Baby travel cot, high baby chair and stroller can be provided at additional cost. There is also a laundry/dry cleaners below and they're amazing at ironing! and you can store bags at this location before and after you check in and out. There is no left luggage or luggage storage available at the property before you check in and after you check out. There is a Storage Service in the Laundromat below this building (Sydney Laundry @ 234 Elizabeth St). Costs are definitely the cheapest in Sydney CBD: only $2/day for small bag, $5-6/day for large luggage. Another options: Across the road at Central Station called Smart Carte (5 minutes walk) or World Square Shopping Centre (4 minutes walk).","interaction":"You'll be the only guests staying, so enjoy the space!

Also, the washing machine was left on when we arrived causing a blockage and subsequently water all over the bathroom floor with no apology or explanation. The most confusing part was the host/cleaner knocking on the door and entering to grab a vacuum cleaner/put away some clean towels in the middle of our stay. We all stared in confusion as she walked in without saying anything, entered a bedroom and then left again. It doesn't seem like a huge deal but I keep thinking, what if I had been in the shower and exited to the bedroom to find someone in it - I would have been terrified.\nThere was also no dishwasher tablets, no clean sponge and no clean tea towels for us to use.

Great place to stay if you're just looking for a comfortable bed and amenities such as a washing machine and dryer. After the cleaning fee and airbnb VAT fees, it cost $307 AUD a night, which is quite expensive compared to a hotel. But in saying that, you won't get some amenities mentioned and location may not be as ideal as Surry Hills. I was a little disappointed initially (looked better in the photos) but if you take into account this fantastic suburb location and want a clean and comfortable stay, then look no further. Lastly, it's a bit of an inconvenience with one set of keys when the listing stated two would be provided.

The extra bed room is also cute and looks like if you are traveling with a child it would be perfect(even with out AC). The windows in the home are usually open letting in a very nice breeze off of the lake. The bathroom is aesthetically pleasing and very clean. The host (Jose)is very helpful and kind and informative. She has newspaper clips and brochures of things that are in the area and gave us tips on things to do. Her home is right at the shore and a windmill from 1709 so the walks always seem to have an amazing view, especially accompanied with some ice cream from a little shop around the corner from her place. The town seems to have a very safe feel, to the point that you could be comfortable sending your children out to play without worry. I would recommend this home and host to anyone.

A pesar de estar en un edificio relativamente antiguo el apartamento ha sido remodelado y tiene un ambiente acogedor y moderno. El baño y la cocina son prácticos, renovados y muy limpios, la sala, comedor y habitación ofrecen espacios agradables y confortables.\n\nAl llegar Maria Lucía nos recibió con gran amabilidad y nos explicó al detalle las condiciones y recomendaciones del apartamento, nos tenía agua embotellada, galletas y otros detalles. Realmente su amabilidad merece 5 estrellas.  \n\nFue inesperado que nos hiciera firmar un contrato durante el hospedaje indicando las fechas de estadía y el valor de cada uno de los artículos dentro del apartamento en caso de daño. Esto nunca lo había hecho en oportunidades anteriores. Esto no fue problema toda vez que devolvimos el apartamento en las mismas condiciones pero fue curioso.\n\nEl Sector: Es una zona céntrica de  Copacabana, con mucho comercio informal y formal. Eso significa vendedores ambulantes, transeúntes, supermercados y restaurantes. No recomendaría caminar después de 10PM por temas de seguridad, aunque es sólo mi percepción. \n\nDespués de mi estadía en la apartamento de Maria Lucía, sólo mejoraría la velocidad de la conexión a internet (es de 1 Mb).\n\nRecomiendo el sitio y a Maria Lucía como superhost!"},{"_id":"242601132","date":{"$date":"2018-03-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"20599393","reviewer_id":"123653087","reviewer_name":"Laureci","comments":"Anfitriã atenciosa, acolhedora e prestativa.

The building is safe (it has a lock outside), it has two elevators and there is no noise from the neighbors (there is only the normal Copacabana noise, but it is appreciated). She had water and snacks for us and everything was set for us to stay, and she even gifted us a bottle of champagne for New Years Eve! It is three blocks from the beach in Copacabana; there are a lot of stores right downstairs. The only thing that should be considered is that the second room is small (but sufficient for one person) and does not have air conditioning, which may be a a problem during the summer. The living room is cozy, with the internet moden and a TV, but it does not have air conditioning either, though it gets better if you open the window. I would definitely stay at Maria Lucia's in the future. Thank you very much!"}]}

She was generous and had a re-loadable transit card, travel guides, milk and coffee available. Everything was clean and welcoming.

The app is not separated by rooms so if there are 2 couples comming there will be a lack of privacy. The balcony is very small but if you are a smoker it will do it's job. The location is central, you can reach really everything  in max 30 min. The only minus is the bed .... king size bed would be great ;) "},{"_id":"56747379","date":{"$date":"2015-12-17T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"206122","reviewer_id":"13277227","reviewer_name":"Jens","comments":"Great location!

High quality interior. Beautiful kitchen and layout of the apartment. It was very clean when we arrived, with towels ready and the beds (both the full and the two doubles) made neatly. Be aware that this is a loft, and there are no full walls, just partitions, including with the bathroom (there is a door on the bathroom and to the toilet). If staying here with other people, make sure you're comfortable with each other, and with sharing private spaces. \n\nThe apartment is on the third floor (second (0,1,2) for my European friends) with a small winding staircase. It can be tough to get big bags all the way up, but Mohamed (who met us at check-in) helped with the lifting. With the windows closed, the apartment is pretty quiet, but as soon as the windows are open, you get the full sound of the neighborhood (great sounds, but people are up pretty late sometimes!). \n\nYou can't beat the price or the location for such a high-quality apartment. \n\nOne thing to be aware of, is that when going with this apartment, you're dealing with a rental company through Alex instead of a single person renting out a couple of places. This means you probably won't meet Alex, instead you'll have someone else meet you at the apartment, and you will need to coordinate that once you arrive in Barcelona. This can be a challenge if you are coming from outside of the country. \n\nAs mentioned above, overall a high quality apartment, and we had a quality stay! \n\nJosh\n\n\n"},{"_id":"124245689","date":{"$date":"2017-01-01T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"206122","reviewer_id":"10046638","reviewer_name":"Stefan","comments":"The apartment was in a superb location and Alex was a great host, being flexible with check-in, organizing a car service from the airport and being very accommodating throughout our stay.

Everything was clean and in a very cute little neighborhood. We really enjoyed the square just down the street to the right. Other hosts provided coffee and the like, but that wasn’t the case so be sure to buy some! The appliances and dishes were perfect for our needs. The tv and DVD player are fickle but if you play with them a little, the picture will come in and they work just fine.

Although the immediate area is primarily residential with young professionals, there are many small restaurants and bars that open in the evening.  \nThe apartment is as presented in the pictures, very stylish and contemporary.   And, yes there are 3 flights of stairs to climb, so large luggage is difficult.

We walked to many tourist locations from the apartment; La Rambla, Parc Güell, Sagrada Família, etc. There is also a metro station located close by along with many high end/designer stores.\nThere’s a lot of steps to get to the apartment as it’s on the top floor, with no elevator, this isn’t a big deal unless climbing a lot of stairs is an issue for you.\nI’m pretty sure every night there was rubbish being collected on the street. This is very loud \u0026 noisy \u0026 takes place around midnight/early hours of the morning. We were always still awake when this happened, but if you are a light sleeper \u0026 like to be asleep before this time then it may impact you.\nCheck-in was smooth except for a few minor issues that were mostly technician issues on my side. We never met Alex in person. We were given the contact number of a gentleman to contact once we arrived at the airport but there was no answer whenever I called. Once we arrived at the Airbnb we were met by a kind lady, this was good as we actually arrived a couple hours after we had expected to arrive due to our flight being delayed. This lady messaged us under the pseudonym of Alex, so just to make you aware you may be speaking with one of his team instead of Alex himself when messaging.\nThe shower can run out of hot water quite fast, there was only two of us and often one would have to wait a while for the water to heat up again after the first one showered. Just be aware everyone in your party should take short showers or maybe at different times of the day when the water heats up again, especially if you have more than 2 in your party.\nNone of these are major issues at all, just things you may want to be aware of before you arrive.\nAlso, I would suggest the metro to get from the airport to the Airbnb, it’s pretty cheap \u0026 easy as there is a metro from the airport \u0026 a metro station just down the street from the Airbnb.\nOverall I would definitely recommend staying here, especially if you are a tourist \u0026 you like to walk \u0026 experience the city!"},{"_id":"271407906","date":{"$date":"2018-06-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"206122","reviewer_id":"171312642","reviewer_name":"Scott","comments":"Such a great location for exploring the city.

We were 6 and it was a perfect fit. The couch was awesome (it had a real matress inside, which was very large and comfortable, more than enough for two persons, even though no pictures of it were provided). Be aware that you will have to pick up the keys to the apartment at the welcome centre, located in the city centre, and not directly at the apartment. However, the employees we talked to were lovely and very welcoming. The only drawback was that it was a little bit far from the centre (~30mn walk, but it is beautiful). Though, uber worked really great for us. It was fast (usually 4-5 mn wait, no more than 10), cheap (2-3€ per person to the centre) and eco-friendly (uber green). The neighbourhood was quiet and nice. with lots of restaurants around. \n\nSo, we strongly recommend this apartment :)\n\nThanks a lot for welcoming us !"},{"_id":"291096619","date":{"$date":"2018-07-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"20619682","reviewer_id":"28097712","reviewer_name":"Miguel","comments":"Comodidad y excelentes servicios."},{"_id":"292969605","date":{"$date":"2018-07-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"20619682","reviewer_id":"49958560","reviewer_name":"Pedro","comments":"Hermoso, tal cual se ve en la fotos, muy recomendable, esta a 10 min del centro (en coche) la vista al rio es hermosa y esta impecable"},{"_id":"302821177","date":{"$date":"2018-08-06T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"20619682","reviewer_id":"1856904","reviewer_name":"Peter","comments":"a very nice and modern apartment and a great view of rio douro.\nwe found also a very good coffee shop nearby: the 7g roasters.

This is a company with more than 300 apartments in Oporto, so if you like a place that 'Feels Like Home', this is not it.  When I choose an airbnb is because I like to see how they live in the city I travel to, not to be in a far a way place that has no soul.  Actually that's what I like about the airbnb concept but in this case it is lost.  \nSince it is a company they can care less about getting back to you on time if you have a question, and it is all about 'rules'.  \nIf you want to be in a hotel-like without the hotel services, this is your place.  If you want to be in place with the essence of the city you travel, then pick another place.\nThe views of the river are great.  it has a parking space which is pretty handy if you come by car."},{"_id":"342768596","date":{"$date":"2018-10-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"20619682","reviewer_id":"51338914","reviewer_name":"Igor","comments":"This place is beautiful.

Ironically, the following day I found a big box of disposable ear plugs on top of the fridge - very thoughtful, considering the noise. Personally, I'm a heavy sleeper, so I did not find the noise to be an issue at all, but it's definitely something to consider for those, who need that complete quiet. In addition, Valery was able to accommodate a last minute reservation extension on my part, which was great. Overall, I loved the place, did not have any issues at all and would recommend staying here.

Not far from the train station and downtown, 50 m from the bus station and 200 m from Santa Catharina - pedestrian street with shops. So, everything is reached on walking distance. Around the corner is supermarket and many cafes. \nAntonio helped us with boarding passes.

The bed was very comfortable, the shower water pressure was so nice, the living room was beautifully furnished (totally my style) - not that we used it, because we were always on the lanai with views of the tropical banana trees outside. The condo doesn't have air conditioning, which wasn't a problem because there are three ceiling fans and then five floor fans that you can move around and point wherever you need to. We felt very comfortable. We loved that they had a guide book in the condo and enjoyed reading about the island. Also, check in/out was super easy with the keypad on the door.

We really didn't make much use of the kitchen as there were so many great dining options nearby, but it appeared to be well equipped for most cooking needs. Our time spent at Poipu Beach was the highlight of our trip as we saw Hawaiian monk seals and at least two different species of endangered sea turtles and enjoyed snorkeling and sunbathing on the beautiful beach. There's no air conditioning but this was not an issue at all for us during our January stay. The temperature in the evening made the condo quite comfortable with open windows and fans.

Tip: the pool can get a bit crowded. We still enjoyed it, everyone at the Villas is super friendly but we also had the opportunity to visit the Koloa Landing (next door) and their resort pool is amazing. If you’re looking to enjoy a more resort style pool, go over to Koloa Landing and use their pool for the day.

I concur with almost all the positive statements such as a large unit, wonderful and responsive hosts, great value,  gorgeous grounds, well stocked kitchen and supplies (especially for the beach), and one of the most comfortable beds I have slept in. However, there were a few surprises that I didn't expect. If you are not fastidious, many or all of these may not matter, but for those of you who are, I think it is good to know before you rent. Although the unit is quiet from street noise and even sounds from neighboring units, you will hear roosters during the night. (Maybe this is seasonal, so I guess I can't say with certainty if this happens every night of the year.) And, at least when we were there, the crowing didn't begin just before sunrise, but beginning around midnight--and every hour after that. After a night or two, we habituate to the sound, but it still disrupted our sleep. Many reviews state it is quiet (which was one of the main reasons I chose this place), so for those of you who will be bothered by occasional rooster crowing, you should keep this in mind. Regarding the unit itself, it overall is very nice and is a great value. However, be prepared for at best average cabinets, lack of down pillows,  and a subpar bathroom (e.g., hard to turn on shower, lack of color coordination). Even though I think overall this is a wonderful unit and Krystal and Eric are outstanding, and we enjoyed our stay (the positives strongly outweighed the negatives), for future travellers who care about some of the minuses I listed, I thought you should know."},{"_id":"402245916","date":{"$date":"2019-01-17T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"20668195","reviewer_id":"59005630","reviewer_name":"Ashley","comments":"Krystal and Eric’s place was perfect for our getaway in Kaua’i. The location was ideal with multiple restaurants, stores, and beaches nearby. They have a closet full of necessities for the beach which was an awesome touch. Krystal was extremely easy to communicate with and very accommodating! Overall, incredible hosts. \n\nAs mentioned in the description, there is no air conditioning, but Krystal has multiple fans set up and the windows help cool the place down. I had no trouble sleeping, but my fiancé who tends to get warm while he sleeps definitely had a little trouble. But other than that we would absolutely recommend this b’ n b’."},{"_id":"402845496","date":{"$date":"2019-01-19T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"20668195","reviewer_id":"181330847","reviewer_name":"Caroline","comments":"Sehr schönes Appartment, komplette Ausstattung, es fehlt an nichts.

The cottage is spotless, well-appointed, and has a beautiful high ceiling. The bed is extremely comfortable with quality lines. The cottage has a quiet AC, but we did not need it. The ceiling fans and trade winds allowed us to keep the windows open, soothed by the sounds of ocean waves and rustling palms. In fact, we slept the best we have in months. The area is peaceful, safe, and an easy walk to the beach and town, where we went to the farmer’s market and bought local fruit, veggies, and baked goods. The kitchenette has a great fridge, good knife for cutting pineapple, nice dishes, microwave, coffeemaker \u0026 Keurig machine, and Lisa gave us wonderful Hawaiian coffee. There are plenty of electrical outlets to plug in devices and Wifi is fine. The shower has a strong water flow, and there are plush towels. We enjoyed sitting on the covered porch and seeing island flora and birds. Lisa and Matt have thought of every detail, including beach gear—towels, mats, boogey boards, and umbrella. Our time at the beach cottage was restorative, and when we return to Oahu, we will definitely stay here. Thank you Matt and Lisa for making the cottage available.

Next, the hospitality: Lisa offered the most fitting recommendations for shopping, activities, and dining. She was great at getting a feel for what we were in the mood for and suggesting a few options. That was invaluable for finding great local spots. Lastly, the town: Kailua is SO gorgeous! The beach is picturesque and the city center has all the comforts like a Whole Foods and great coffee, but also so many local shops, restaurants, yoga, farmers markets, etc..

Kailua is the ideal location for those who want to be far away, but close enough to Honolulu, and have accessibility to explore other areas like the north shore. The cottage is in a beautiful area within a very short walking distance to gorgeous Kailua beach and nearby Lanikai beach. The laid back town has many great local shops and eateries and any services that you may require. Whole Foods is well-stocked and there are two local markets during the week. My husband and I particularly enjoyed walking along Kailua beach and stopping at the Kalapawai Market for a coffee in the morning. We had a beautiful dinner featuring the local daily catch at the Kalapawai Deli and Cafe. Buzz's Original Steak House is a bit pricey, but has a great history with nicely prepared dinner entress (loved the cajun-style ahi and grass-fed tenderloin with garlic mash) and famous mai tais that certainly pack a beautiful punch. The Pill Box hike provides an amazing view of the entire area and is certainly worth the mild climb to the top and continues across the ridge if you desire.\n\nThe cottage itself was absolutely spotless and just beautiful! Newly renovated and tastefully decorated in an ocean theme with an airy and fresh open ceiling, two ceiling fans, shutter windows, and the option for air-conditioning was just fantastic. The sound of the waves and waking up to the songs of the local birds each morning created a serene and relaxing atmosphere. The kitchen is fully stocked to make light meals and snacks. Lisa was so thoughtful in leaving us some local cookies and providing me with organic decaf coffee upon our arrival after I asked her where I could find some. We were able to purchase local tropical fruit and made beautiful smoothies each morning with the Ninja blender that conveniently included to-go containers. The lanai was a lovely place to eat breakfast after walking the beach in the morning. Beach gear was also provided including boogie boards, fresh beach towels and mats, umbrella, and beach chairs. There are even two bikes available to tour the local area.\n\nThe very best part was the warmth and hospitality of Lisa and her family! We were given the privacy we needed along with friendly conversation and open communication. Lisa was always available to recommend places to visit, answer any questions that we had, and provide us with anything additional we might need. We even had the chance to share some stories and walk with their lovely golden lab who was happy to tour us around the best parts of the beach as only a great dog can do!\n\nCommunication from our initial contact with Lisa to the end of our trip was friendly, expedient and efficient. We would definitely recommend the beach cottage to others and look forward to returning again! \n\nAloha Lisa!!!"},{"_id":"233241873","date":{"$date":"2018-02-08T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"20680853","reviewer_id":"62179438","reviewer_name":"Laura","comments":"This private bungalow sits behind the main house and is cute and efficient.

The beach cottage and all that it had to offer made us feel right at home. Leaving the windows open, to the sound of the ocean with the perfect breeze, made each night. The mornings were just as peaceful especially being steps away from watching the sunrise with a cup of coffee. The location on the island was exactly what we were looking for. Our days were busy but our favorite part of the day was coming back to OUR place! We cannot thank you enough for such an immaculate experience. Highly recommend this remarkable family!"},{"_id":"268089757","date":{"$date":"2018-05-23T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"20680853","reviewer_id":"8706893","reviewer_name":"Patrick And Brianne","comments":"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful! Lisa's place was a lovely oasis to return to after a day of trips to the beach and local sights. The location was perfect for our long weekend stay with just a short drive from the airport (20ish minutes) outside of the crazy traffic in downtown Honolulu. Lisa was warm and very generous with her time and local expertise. She had amazing recommendations on places to eat and things to do. It's less than 2 blocks from the most perfect sandy beach you can imagine! The small shopping area is about a mile away and easy to get to by car or bike with solid breakfast options and a Whole Foods for groceries. The room was breezy and comfortable with the absence of a TV a welcome change of pace. Many good books were read on the comfy bed, the sunny patio chairs outside, or down at the beach.

Even though we knew the town, she and her husband had great advice and suggestions that we had never known on places to eat and things to do. The space was gorgeous and newly remodeled with all the amenities one would need on a beach vacation. Riding around this beautiful town on the provided bikes and living truly like a local was invaluable. Not to forget the hop and skip across the small street to the shoreline of a secluded local beach.  We will definitely be back!! \n\nPS, that sweet yellow Labrador (Roxy) was the cherry on top with her enthusiasm for dog walks and Lisa's willingness to let us practically adopt her for the week.

The beach house is a separate, small self-contained unit near the main house, with secure parking and easy street access. Kailua Beach is a 5 minute walk away, and having visited 10+ 'name beaches' on Oahu and the Big Island this trip, Kailua was our favorite. Miles of powder white, clean, soft sand, gentle warm surf, and mostly locals and families without the big crowds found on nearby beaches like Lanikai, let alone Waikiki. Unit was spotlessly clean, simple but modern with all the essentials. Very comfortable large bed, A/C present but we never used it as overhead fans and constant ocean breeze with surf sound in background kept us cool at night, very quiet for sleeping (and no roosters, sometimes a night noise issue in other Hawaiian towns!) Small kitchen with everything required, including both drip and keurig-style coffee makers, and bottled water and other starter supplies in fridge.  Beach towels, chairs, boards, bikes etc. all available if wanted. In line with quiet, simple beach lifestyle, no TV or stereo distractions, but excellent house high speed internet for those needing some screen time, with good mobile phone service across rest of Kailua. Lisa was always available for help or tips, and we thoroughly enjoyed meeting her and her family and learning about their life in Kailua. Kaillua town itself was pleasant and modern small town with good array of shops, services, and places suggested by Lisa to purchase food or eat out. We had good meals at nearby Nico's (couple of times, our favorite), walk up pizza at Bob's by the beach, good Thai at Champa's, and enjoyed slightly more formal meals at Baci Bistro and Buzz's (latter two restaurants we suggest reservations).  Though quiet and beach focused, Lisa's place was only a 25 min. drive from airport and Pearl Harbour (along spectacular IH3 through mid-island mountains and tunnels). Despite gov. shutdown we had excellent visit to PH sites spread over 2 days, leaving afternoons free for beach! All in all our stay at Lisa's  place was great and we hope to return some day from snowy Ontario!

Every thing was updated and very clean. It would be perfect for one person on a business trip not planning to spend much time in the room aside to sleep. \nThe studio was very tight. It seemed as if it were a part of one of the connecting units before and seperated as it's own. It did not have the extra bed, room, tvs, or table and chairs as listed. There was a folding chair in the closet but really no room to set it up anywhere. Host did confirm that it were only two people but never said of any differences or changed the price. \nIt is completely residential. Families and quiet time in tight housing units. It felt like a safe area but perhaps not a vacation spot. I was glad to see that a spot was available at the beginning of a long driveway, otherwise parking was limited. I wouldn't consider it walking distance to as much as listed but definitely a short and easy drive."}]}

Perfect situated at the George Orwell square in the middle of the old town. It is not a design or extraordinary type of apartment but clean and all you need. Everything was as descripted and the handover of the key was very friendly and uncomplicated. The apartment is at the second floor and the stairway is very narrow and steep (no elevator) – but we were informed about this and even with two small kids it was no problem. A baby cot and baby chair was provided without additional cots – what is a very good service!! It can be noisy from outside (weekends) but this is always the case if you live in the old town of BCN and the bedroom is located at the quiet side of the apartment – just for the person(s) sleeping on the coach-bed (what is a good quality of bed) it can be a bit disturbing. We can absolutely recommend this apartment for a short stay."},{"_id":"40247727","date":{"$date":"2015-07-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2068454","reviewer_id":"16712074","reviewer_name":"Lyra","comments":"We arrived Friday night and our flight was running late.  We called right away to inform the host once we landed (23:00).  Our host was very kind and understanding and waited for our arrival.  We had a great taxi driver as he knew that area quite well.  The only fall back is that the taxi driver had to drop us off a few blocks before our building because the garbage truck was blocking the way (one-way street).  We finally arrived and our journey was just starting.  We still had to walk up several flights of stairs -58 stairs to be exact in a very small narrow walk way (about 30 inches wide/ .75 meters wide ) to reach the 2nd floor.  We had 4 suitcase and our host so was so nice he helped by taking one up THE SMALLEST suitcase of them all!!  By the time we reached the 2nd floor we were sweating like dogs. \r\n\r\nThe apartment itself and the décor was run downed.  The pictures definitely fooled us!  The black plastic chairs drove me crazy, especially when you slide them out to sit.  Its like nails on a chalkboard.  The walls of the apartment are very, very thin.  We could hear our neighbors above and below playing music, talking, and I also believe they have they same plastic chairs as they dragged them across the floor.  \r\n\r\nWarning! Be careful in the shower not to touch the cylinder spout, (it is where the shower handled sits on to turn on/off or hot or cold) IT WILL BURN you.  Also there are no shelves in the shower to hold hygiene products which was unpleasant.  Keep the toilet lid closed as much as possible because the water smells like urine.  The host only left one extra roll of toilet paper which was not enough for our stay so, we just went to the supermarket to buy a pack.  The beds were stiff but we managed.  The one nice amenity was the washer and dryer, but again we had to walk up another 50+ stairs to reach the top floor.\r\n\r\nAll and all, other than the apartment the location was good.  It was walking distance to everything we wanted to see and do.  I love the placas where you can enjoy a nice dinner or take a break for a cappuccino.  \r\n\r\nFrom all my travels…no matter how much research or pictures you look at to find the perfect place, you really won’t know until you actually go and experience it for yourself.  Everyone has their own preference and expectations."},{"_id":"44774770","date":{"$date":"2015-08-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2068454","reviewer_id":"36475794","reviewer_name":"Sarah","comments":"My experience at the R2 apartment was overall a pleasant one. My flight was several hours late and without cell service in Spain, I was stressed about getting in touch with the owners for the key exchange. The drop off went off without a hitch; everything was explained clearly and the host was very accommodating and friendly. \r\n\r\nThis apartment is in a fantastic location. The Barri Gothic is definitely one of the cooler parts of the city to stay in. Nearby dining, shops, and walking are awesome. The apartment is furnished simply but the furniture was comfortable and I found the pictures accurate. For the price, I think it really is a bargain. \r\n\r\nFor the not-so-great: it's true, the apartment is up a decent flight of stairs and hauling luggage up and down isn't fun. I think this is pretty standard for the area and the owners clearly outline this in the description. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the apartment also smells weird. I suspect this has something to do with the sewer system in the building/bathroom, I wasn't quite able to pin down the exact source. My travel mate described it as \"an airplane urinal smell\" and although the apartment appeared well-cleaned and perhaps this was beyond the owners' control, this issue was undeniable. Probably the worst part of the stay was the fact that there was loud, early morning construction right outside our bedroom window two of the days we were there. This definitely stunk. Yet again, might not be the owners' fault but with the jet lag and Barcelona late night schedule, this was less than ideal. Hopefully this is a temporary situation.\r\n\r\nOverall, I think you get what you pay for. If you're looking for a basic relatively comfortable flat in the heart of an awesome district, this apartment is perfect for you. If you're envisioning pristine, hotel-esque lodging you might be disappointed. Keep your expectations in check and you'll be happy here.

Wir waren rundum zufrieden und werden, wenn wir wieder eine Unterkunft benötigen in Porto gerne wieder zu Familie Pereira gehen.

The accommodation is spacious and clean with amazing nightly views of the stars and glowing lava landscape. Most visitors are only allowed to view the lava between between the hours of 5-9PM, but since we were staying at Uncle Kalani's place, we were able to see the lava flow anytime we liked - both at night and at sunrise. Uncle Kalani and Aunty Dee were excellent hosts. They were kind and generous in taking great care to explain how to use and operate the house, and for convenience sake, they posted instructions around the house should anybody forget. It was real treat to stay at this airbnb, and I would definitely stay there again.

The home is beyond the security gate that separates public parking from \"resident\" access.  Since you are staying at the home, you get to drive beyond the gate and park at the house.  If you plan to rent bikes or catch a shuttle (as far as they're allowed to take you), you can leave your car parked at the house and walk (less than 5 minutes) to the tour companies.  Very convenient.  \n\nThe home itself is great.  The shipping container is well designed and very nice.  The queen sized bed and twin sized bunk beds are on opposite ends of the same container, so there is definitely not complete privacy in that sense--but a cute room divider makes the queen bed area feel separate and cozy.  Couch, table, and chairs are all great.  Outside of the container living space, the kitchen area and full bathroom are both located in the covered lanai.  We were pleasantly surprised to find that the shower hot water headed-up almost instantly.  We had no problems with electricity or water.  The upstairs loft is neat, with long, narrow peek-out windows on either side.  We could see nighttime lava glow from the front of the house (upstairs and downstairs).  There is one little house right next door, and a few others nearby, but you really get the sense of privacy and remoteness. \n\nIt you are looking for surface lava flow on the Kalapana side, this is definitely where you want to stay!  Such a spacious, unique, pleasant place!  The location can't be beat.  Kalani was a great host, too, with a fast response time whenever we had questions."},{"_id":"212213353","date":{"$date":"2017-11-16T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"20695115","reviewer_id":"1568034","reviewer_name":"Hector","comments":"If you want to watch the flowing lava at night...

We had a few options near the lava fields, but chose this home because of the outdoor space. Our son hoped to put up his hammock, but that wasn’t possible. He was happy to sleep on the bed outside, so all went great.  We found the home to be clean and comfortable, the hosts responsive, friendly, and patient with my own Airbnb newbie failings. The water is very hot, so be careful. It does provide for a wonderful hot bath!  The coffee the host supplied was really good, but if you want real cream (not powdered), bring your own, they do not store perishables in the refrigerator.  A large cooler is available, and a local convenience style store where visitors can purchase ice, sandwiches, beer and wine, fruit, snacks, etc. is not far.  There are also food trucks and bike rentals a short distance from the Grass Shack. \n\nThe Pacific breeze is constant and provides the best cooling system ever! We stayed in January, so overall temperatures were milder than summer.  \n\nOur family was visiting the area for a sunset lava hike (which was awesome!).\nWe were grateful to have our home away so close to that activity.  The road in front can get busy as it is the only way to the lava viewing sites, but it is also restricted so most people are on bikes or foot.  We did not find the activity intrusive, even while using the kitchen (which is outside)."},{"_id":"225894654","date":{"$date":"2018-01-07T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"20695115","reviewer_id":"31366710","reviewer_name":"James","comments":"We loved our stay at Kalani's and Deneen's. \n\nThe space itself was beautiful--most of the common area it's open to the air so you get a nearly 360 view of the surrounding area. The kitchen area, bathroom, and loft were all very well-maintained. The supplies for the kitchen were more than adequate. There were utensils, plates, basics like oil salt and pepper, and a small hot-plate for quick small meals. There was a nice grill that we didn't use (but i wish that we had!). \n\nThere's a lot of common space--it would be fun for a group of 4 friends or family. \n\nThe loft especially provides a very nice view. We could see the glow of lava at night like some others have said in their reviews. \n\nThe location close to the lava viewing area was great as well. We rented bikes to ride out to the beginning of the hike to the active lava flow. We did the hike at night and I would highly recommend it. Make sure you bring extra flashlights and keep an eye on your location so you can find your way back!  \n\nWe would definitely come back with a bigger group!

The bike rental is less than 5 min walk from the house which is located on the main road right near the entrance to the neighborhood.  Bike for about 3 miles to  the end gate and then hike for about an hour over the lava field (no path) towards the lava glow.  Bring one or all of the lanterns supplied in the home (very convenient) for the night hike back.  Electrical outlet is outside near the  fridge for charging of phones, cameras, and the internet supplied jetpack.  Bathroom water supply was great.  I didn't cook though hot plate and bar-b-que supplied if you wanted to (no microwave).  Slept very well in the double bed and enjoyed both the many, many stars at night and the lovely sunrises in the morning from the lanai.  Only two suggestions for adding to the fabulous stay at this beautiful tiny home:  (i) some directions explaining where the jetpack and bathroom key are stored and how to use the jetpack would be helpful, though after a text to Kalani and quick response all was figured out; and (ii) adding more curtains in the home and bathroom since the location of the home is near the road and other homes.  There are many dips in the dirt road once the paved road ends so I was glad to have the Jeep.  Enjoyed the convenience store near Uncle Roberts for supplies as well as the dining options in Pahoa (about 20 min or so drive from neighborhood).  An hour drive to the volcano park and the Red Road Drive can start at the painted church not far from leaving the neighborhood on 130.

Just as described. We loved that it was off the grid, and a bit in the middle of nowhere. If you think of it is high end camping, it has everything you need! Liked being able to walk out the door and wander through the old lava fields. Could see the glow of the caldera at night (but remember to get to it is an hour drive). Make sure to go snorkelling at the Kopoho tide pools (30 min away). Kitchen had everything we needed, and we cooked every night (BBQ, small fridge, running water, cooking utensils etc.). Check in was easy, lock box code and use the key. It's more noisy around there than you would think (roosters in the morning, crickets, rain on a metal roof) so you might want to bring ear plugs if you're a light sleeper. Closest store is a 20-30 minute drive away, so stock up before you arrive. Adventurous travellers will love this place! People who are bothered by a gecko in their bathroom may not appreciate its charm. I have recommended it to a bunch of friends already, and would definitely go back again when we're on the big island."},{"_id":"252712073","date":{"$date":"2018-04-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"20695115","reviewer_id":"14517413","reviewer_name":"Kaycie","comments":"What a wonderful, off the beaten path place to stay on Hawaii.

Make sure to read the house manual, as it was clear the hosts live by this (I read it but missed one thing.

Though constructed partially from a shipping container and labeled a \"tiny home,\" it didn't at all feel like either. There was ample space for the three of us and the outdoor kitchen was totally awesome. We successfully cooked both dinner and breakfast, enjoying a warm breeze throughout and utilizing the picnic table to dine. Kalani and Dee left snacks (which we thoroughly enjoyed) and potable water (though we almost went through all of it in our one night stay). As noted in the listing, it's still a hike to the lava flow, but it's nice even just to walk around or rent nearby bikes. We did hear the neighbors at night—they next home is in very close proximity—but that wasn't a dealbreaker and it was otherwise very peaceful and beautiful. We all really loved the mix of indoor/outdoor space and the experience of being on the lava rock.

The panoramic views are incredible. \nWe were a little apprehensive when we first pulled up, like what did we get ourselves into? (This was our first time using Airbnb, and second stay on our Hawaii trip.) After settling in we begin to see what a special place this is. There is so much attention to detail, every little thing is well thought out in the Grass Shack. And the outside views are the icing on the cake. So much to see! There's even bikes available for a bike ride through the lava flows. We had a fantastic time at Uncle Robert's Market - real Hawaiian culture there, not another show. Check out Suisan's Fish Market in Hilo for fresh poke or to purchase fresh fish to bring back to the shack for grilling.\nIf we ever come back to Hawaii we'd love to stay here again.

The house is down a partially unpaved road (you will have 3 small stretches of unpaved parts to navigate through potholes) but we didn't have any problems with a little Nissan Versa sedan (but also for sure most people around here looked like they have 4WD :) ). It is in a small area with other similar (off grid) houses so while you are definitely not close to a town, you will have other people driving by and such. Not at all a problem for us, but in case you were hoping to be the only ones around, you will hear and see cars going past. The house is really cool. Off grid, but with the conveniences of home like running water in the sinks and shower and toilet, and electricity and wifi. We had no problems getting anything to work (though the shower temp can fluctuate so you will want to be a little careful of that). We cooked a couple of breakfasts via the small propane burner as well as made burgers on the grill. There are plenty of pots, pans, dishes, etc and also some salt/pepper, oil, and other spices that were all really appreciated. It did rain a lot while we were there (it's winter, so we expected it) and it can be louder than you might be used to because of the roof; it didn't bother us. We slept in the container part and didn't use the upstairs loft much except to get a few photos. We went into Pahoa a few times for food (Ning's and Kaleo's) and to get groceries; it's about 15-20 minutes to town. The new black sand beach at Isaac Hale is about 30-45 minutes and it was 1 hour to Volcanoes National Park.

Thank you for nothing.\n\nWe feel really let down by you as a company. \n\n You cancelled our 1st  booking, apparently there was a problem with your airbnb account. (my alarm bells should have been ringing then, but the apartment seemed perfect for us, location and price wise). \nWhen I contacted you about the issue we re-booked. \nWhen requested you price matched the 1st booking. \nWhen I requested check-in details I had no response, 3 days prior to departure or day before departure. \nAfter a 27+hr flight from UK to Sydney we arrived at the airport and went to check the address details and directions and found the email to say the apartment booking had been cancelled. I get the reason, if its true, I understand. But we landed at 9pm with nowhere to stay. \nDid you personally offer to help us or find us alternative accommodation with you?  A BIG FAT NO! \nRefund when requested. \nNext day we attempted to book another apartment with you and you actually declined us, when really you should have been helping us  to find somewhere to stay.\nThat is what shocked me the most, the unhelpfulness. You knew why we wanted to stay, you knew the problems we had had before - none of them our fault and still you refused to help. \n\nNo thanks to you, we now have a different apartment/hotel for the duration of our stay - not with your company. To say we were disappointed is an understatement. \n\nI WOULD NOT RECOMMEND YOU."}]}

We wouldn't hesitate to stay in this unit again.  The parking is easy, covered, and convenient (and very reasonably priced for Waikiki), there are tons of dining options nearby, the beach is a block away, and the heart of Waikiki is within minutes walking distance.  Because it is on the east end of Waikiki, it is much easier to get in and out of this building than others we have stayed in on the western end.  The unit had everything we needed for a great stay; plenty of linens, kitchen supplies, beach chairs, and it was nice to be able to close off the doors to the bedroom area so everyone (we were a party of four) didn't have to go to bed at the same time.  Huge balcony with ocean views and air conditioning were a plus!  Lots of nice amenities in the building- pool, hot tub, laundry on every floor, front desk staff to answer questions, coffee shop, little mini mart.  We highly recommend this unit and owner."},{"_id":"284646672","date":{"$date":"2018-07-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"20712093","reviewer_id":"80158323","reviewer_name":"Youa","comments":"Pros; \n-Affordable condo with a corner beach view\n-One block away from the beach\n-Certain amenities included \n-Nice balcony with some swimming noodles, chairs, etc (we didn't use, but looks useful)\n-Lockbox accessible \n-Lots of hangers\n-3 beds, (one pullout, two bed)\n-A foam topper\n-extra linen\n\nCons;\n-Poor communication.

Had to find the router and enter it old school way.\n-Small knives only. So you can only do light cooking. Luckily we only needed a small knife for our watermelon.\n-One trash can in the kitchen, no extra bags or directions as to dispose.\n-Dirty shower with some stains and dents.\n-Not alot of room to move by the closet, beds took alot of room.\n-Bring your own condiments.

They have a very strict cancellation policy (7 days), which is fine. I politely asked to be refunded for the $30.00 cleaning fee, but was denied. They said the room had to be dusted and have the smell refreshed prior to next arrival that was coming in. So I paid for 3 nights and a $30.00 cleaning fee for a place I never set foot in. It does look like a nice place to stay though, thus why I did not give them poor ratings."},{"_id":"259838011","date":{"$date":"2018-05-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"20717948","reviewer_id":"185566836","reviewer_name":"Judi","comments":"What a charming location in a very quiet neighborhood.

At the end, once in their apartment we decided to say no to pay extra as it wasn't mentioned when we booked the room. They agreed so we had no further issues. \nFunny facts: \n- They are quite cost-conscious so you will have to open the toilet key so the flush works.\n- You can use their washing machine but with your own washing soap\u0026softener (reflexion: as a 1/2/3 night host, would you buy a bottle of soap?)\n- Hot water is available but had no clue how to turn it on. \n- They make you park in the gravel.

Unfortunately, due to our busy schedule of visiting different countries and many different areas/attractions of Hong Kong, it is difficult to feel relaxed and comfortable in a place as such. There was also a bit of miscommunication between the host, Selena, as there were times it was difficult to reach her in a timely manner. (Keep in mind, sometimes tourists do not have the best reception from their service providers). Anyhow, we did not stay here and immediately had to look for other accommodations after checking in and took a loss on the booking— mainly due to the size of the place. She also took a while to set up the room for us and it did cut into our scheduled travel times which was unfortunate.

The split bathroom is a dream since my husband had one sink area and I had the other. Courtney's place is perfectly located for easy access to shops and restaurants, some within walking distance and equally easy access to routes to the rest of the island. Though she has a full life with her family she was always easy to contact and it felt more like you were staying with a close friend. In previous reviews road noise has been mentioned.

I never got a response.   Then I sent a message a couple days prior to arriving and still no response.  Me, my wife and 2 year old daughter arrived in Hawaii at noon and as planned went to pick up our rental car.  I then received a message from the property owner saying that there were plumbing issues in the home that she was unaware of.  That was it. No options or anything just that and to feel free to call her.  So I called and still no suggestions for alternatives other than we will try to get it fixed by tomorrow and a plumber was coming between 8-9am I gave the phone to my wife because I had to handle the rental car.  Her husband got on the phone and said their are no other air bnb  in lanikai beach.  So we ended up getting a hotel in Waikiki hoping that I would receive a call in the morning.  I also had a package delivered to the home so I had to drive out there and get it because it was on ice packs and could not sit too long outside.   The next morning I checked my account for refund and still nothing and no word from them.  I called air bnb at around 11 am and they said the reservation was still open and that they didn’t hear anything about the issue. So they called her and she told them that the issue was fixed and ready at normal check in which is 3pm. I was already supposed to be checked in the day before so i was confused on that statement.  I already had to check out of my hotel and get a different hotel for the night so my family wasn’t stuck in a car in limbo. At this point I just wanted to be refunded as there was too much going on.   Air bnb said they are refunding me for the 3 nights and it’s a bummer that we never got to stay in lanikai. The first part of our vacation definitely started rocky but we are still trying to enjoy the rest of our vactation.  Thank you to air bnb for your help in this situation.

It is walking distance to the metro and to old Montreal which is great for anyone visiting the city. The check-in was simple and seamless. The apartment itself had everything that was needed and I liked the fact that there were several toiletries available for use in case you forgot anything (shampoo, conditioner etc.). However, the apartment faces another building so there is not much of a view if you are looking for that. That being said, location cannot be beat and for the most part we only came back to the apartment for sleep. All in all this was a great experience and we appreciate John's timely responses whenever we had a question.

He is very hospitable, sociable, always ready to answer any questions and give advice. \nThe house is very spacious and warm, with all necessary equipment, and the atmosphere is so that I felt like at home)  \nYou will need about 30-40 minutes to go to the centre of Istambul by bus, keep it in mind when you plan your trip.\nBut though it is a bit far from the centre, there are advantages too. The house is situated in the district for locals, not for tourists. So you can buy cheap food there. You can find locum for 6 lira/kilo, cheap nuts and other turkish delights. There are also local shops near the house with good quality cotton clothes, underwear, tights etc.\nDefinitely recommend this host!

Greeted by John here rather than at the apartment, he claimed it was a fire hazard to congregate outside the entrance, but after being shown around the apartment by John he asked us not to mention Airbnb but instead to say we were visiting friends.  Airbnb has been vilified in NYC as taking trade from hotels.\n\nApartment was not dirty, more grubby, but acceptable.  Most things were clean, but things like the light switches and doors were all covered in fingerprints.\n\nIt's an old building so had some quirks, e.g. the spiral stairs to the lower floor were quite wobbly and there was a water pipe from floor to ceiling in the kitchenette area.  This got very very very hot from time to time, too hot to touch or you would burn yourself. This surprisingly wasn't mentioned by John.  There was no way to control the temperature in the apartment and when the pipe heated and cooled the wooden floor would click noisily through the night as it expanded and contracted.  This was worse for the member of our group staying in the common area.\n\nOne of the front bedrooms was very cold, the AC unit in the window was poorly fitted and so let in lots of cold air.\n\nBring you own toilet paper!  What was supplied was single ply and was better at spreading rather than cleaning!!\n\nThe actual location in Manhattan was ideal with easy access to most areas either on foot or the nearby subway.  This made up for the apartments shortcomings as we were out most of the time.\nIt was also a good price compared to hotels and allowed the seven of us to have a shared area which would have been difficult in a hotel.  One bathroom was a challenge for us but this we knew about this in advance.\n\nFinally, I wouldn't re-book or recommend this to a friend."},{"_id":"344020823","date":{"$date":"2018-11-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"20741058","reviewer_id":"207685553","reviewer_name":"Hanns","comments":"Here you can expect a nice apartment close to both the subway, shops and nice cafés within a couple of minutes walking distance.

You cannot adjust the heat in the apartment and there is a pole in the middle of the kitchen that gets very hot. 2. The staircase is extremely narrow and hard to use, especially with luggage. 3.  There is a lot of street noise in the front two bedrooms. People chat outside beginning at around 5am.  4. The bathroom in the apartment is not the one pictured in the listing. It is much smaller and not what I would call “spacious”. 5. The pigeons hang out right outside all the windows and make noises day and night.

Here are the pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n- Perfect location next to the metro, CVS, restaurants, bars, and a quick shot to many different parts of town.\n- Very clean! The kitchen and bathroom are recently redone. The sheets were clean and comfortable.\n- Great amenities! Coffee pot, tea kettle, and even a dishwasher were very nice to have breakfast in the apartment. He even has a stash of Tide if you want to wash a few things in the sink.\n- Lots of seating - the main room has enough chairs (albeit plastic ones) that all 6 of us could hang out in there comfortably.\n- The beds were all pretty comfortable. I could have done with fluffier pillows but I just stole pillows from the downstairs bed and that helped.\n\nCons:\n- The stairs. If you really need that fourth bedroom downstairs, good luck. Fortunately we had 3 couples so everyone stayed upstairs. I would have been very concerned if someone had to go up this crazy narrow staircase in the middle of the night to use the restroom. Sadly, it’s the largest room with the biggest bed. Unfortunately it’s more of a loft space so there’s no door so don’t expect any privacy or quiet down there.\n- 1 restroom. Not ideal for the amount of people this place sleeps, but that can’t be helped.\n- The street noise and light. The con of having a first floor apartment next to a 24 hour CVS - people were outside the window at all hours of the night on the phone, fighting, etc. one of the windows was even above the building’s dumpster so you could hear people going through the trash at night. Also the light shines right from the street into the front rooms. Bring ear plugs and an eye shade.\n- It was a bit strange that Zack wanted us to meet him at the bagel shop down the street and not in front of the apartment, but didn’t tell us until an hour before we arrived. Well, I missed the email anyway as we were trying to navigate transportation."},{"_id":"415780203","date":{"$date":"2019-02-23T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"20741058","reviewer_id":"224700300","reviewer_name":"Jocelyne","comments":"Le logement est idéalement situé, en toute proximité de plusieurs lignes de métro et de commerces permettant de s'approvisionner notamment en mufins pour le petit-déjeuner...\nLe logement était adapté pour nous 6 (4 chambres avec rangements), au delà ça peut être un peu juste (pas suffisamment de chaises et table trop petite).\nNous avons trouvé le logement dans très bon état de propreté.\nA renouveler le cas échéant !"}]}

I contacted Jarad early in the stay however he wasn't willing to provide the key. It is also worth noting that the bedrooms back onto a laneway with rubbish trucks coming past in the early hours of the morning (we stayed on a friday/sat night).

We were 4 in total so the 2 bedrooms were good. It's nice they had a washer and dryer, although we didn't use them. Only issue was, the washer is hidden INSIDE the shower, meaning it took up half of its supposed space which made it so cramped and small. My parents are senior citizens so they had a hard time moving around. I honestly can't imagine a bigger man (Westerners/Europeans) being able to move around there comfortably as my parents are not that big to begin with. There were also a few stains on the sofa and carpet, but the rest of the area and furniture were clean.. Other than that our overall stay was good. \n\nAna, our contact during our stay is great too. Kind and very responsive. However, we had some issues with the car service they offered. I'm not sure if this is an isolated case with the specific driver we were assigned to, but he was always late and he also got into an accident on our 3rd supposed pick up from him which made us have a hard time getting back very late at night. This accident also affected our airport transfer on our last day and we had not been notified sooner so we could hire another car service. OLA was suggested (an app like Uber that's supposedly cheaper) but we had a hard time getting a car the morning of our flight. In fear of missing our flight we had to get an Uber instead (good thing there was a car nearby) and it cost us A LOT of money. We just wish this could have been handled better..."},{"_id":"338188687","date":{"$date":"2018-10-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"20767798","reviewer_id":"34714586","reviewer_name":"Kylie","comments":"Great location, so convenient for us as we were seeing a show at the Opera House.

It was a great jump off point to catch the cruise ships, the Royal Botanical Gardens, and the Sydney Opera House. \n\nAna, the local agent, had a limited schedule, but dropped off our keys at the apartment and was very communicative throughout the check-in and check-out process. The room was fit to sleep 6 adults and was spacious enough for my family. The place did smell of disinfectant and the carpet showed some signs of wear. \n\nKeep in mind that you are in the city, so train and traffic noise will be part of the experience.

The washroom was very clean as well. \n\nThe kitchen is very modern and clean but it was tight sharing it with another couple and the owners in the morning.\n\nOur host David, had a couple of friends over the night we stayed and even though it wasn't a big party we could hear people talking and going in and out of the washroom, which was enough noise to keep us up until 2am. \n\nThe next day David mentioned it was a one time occurrence. The one big suggestion we have for him is to not have guests if you're planning to party at your place or at least mention it at the time of booking before accepting a reservation so the guest can know what to expect and decide if they want to stay there or not.\n\nRosangela was very nice, she apologized for the late night incident and did everything that was in her hands to make the rest of our stay comfortable. They were very kind to let us keep our bags for 5 hours after check out as our flight wasn't until later in the day.\n"},{"_id":"308963633","date":{"$date":"2018-08-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"20774523","reviewer_id":"199632519","reviewer_name":"Kamil","comments":"Polecam!

That's why we enjoyed our stay there. Sarah and Jack are so friendly, and we had a good communication with them. It's typical for New Yorker apartments that they have trouble with cockroaches, so we saw some there too. But Jack and Sarah immediately did the best they could to deal with this problem and to get rid of the very little number of cockroaches we saw there. That was very helpful. We would definitely recommend this apartment to any one! And we hope to be there some day again (not just because we miss the pets :) ) And if you want to eat one of the best pizzas of your life - please taste the delicious pizza from \"Tony's\" nearby the apartment."}]}

Before I describe the series of events that took place, which soured our experience, I want to mention that the apartment is very clean, well located, spacious and well equipped.\n\nOn the day of check-in, our flight landed early and we reached the building at 1pm (check-in time in the Airbnb listing is 4pm). We met a housekeeper and told her we were early and just wanted to drop our bags. She told us we could go ahead and drop our bags in the apartment. We did just that and left the building. In 30 mins, we got a text from David accusing us of breaking into his apartment and of leaving some dead fish smell. We immediately came back and there was no smell in the apartment. Apparently, it was some mis-communication between him and his housekeeper. \n\nWhen I asked him if I could give him a call to clarify things, he gave a very rude and unwarranted response saying he won’t speak on the phone and we were at fault. \n\nDavid’s behavior was so unpleasant and unprofessional. \n\nNext, there was the car that he had agreed to lend us for our stay because he couldn’t apply some discount he had promised on the Airbnb listing. There was a lot of back and forth on this. He constantly kept asking for an additional $100 - first saying that  he forgot to add cleaning fee, then saying that we owe him that much for the car that, and then finally agreeing that it was a misunderstanding on his part.  Finally, When we arrived, he again said we should deposit $25 per day for the car in his account. After clarifying, he let us use his car for no charge. \n\nWe took a picture of the fuel tank reading before using the car and filled up more fuel than we found the car with. Despite that he sent us rude texts saying we didn’t fill up his car. \n\nOverall – I would not recommend staying at David’s place because of the way we were spoken to. Maybe he’s nice to other guests but our experience was quite the opposite."},{"_id":"220537695","date":{"$date":"2017-12-22T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"20789773","reviewer_id":"12906466","reviewer_name":"Katie","comments":"The condo was decent. We stayed here with one other couple and there was plenty of space. If you’re going to the beach, the condo has lots of supplies for the water. The kitchen is stocked with most things needed to cook a meal. \nWe had difficulty with the car that was available. Unfortunately, it was not working properly (not drivable), and since I was the first to bring this to Dave’s attention, he didn’t believe me. We spent our own time taking a look at the issue, but he did not have it fixed during our stay, so we had to cancel plans for our trip that required driving (or pay $250 per day for a last minute car rental). If you’re familiar with this island, you’ll know that there’s not much to see if you don’t have a car. The lack of car ended up being pretty costly with multiple Uber rides. his definitely ruined our trip and I didn’t get an apology until I asked him for one. \nI’m pretty easy-going when it comes to Airbnb stays, but this was definitely not up to par. It’s very evident that this is a new property and Dave is learning as he’s going. Unfortunately, my Christmas vacation had to suffer because of this."},{"_id":"221524945","date":{"$date":"2017-12-26T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"20789773","reviewer_id":"39641483","reviewer_name":"Melissa","comments":"What an awesome location; so close to so many things.

It was really useful having a four wheel drive car to navigate around Big Island.\n\nTo be improved:\n- Not as clean and new as I wish it would be, there were small stains left on the towels, the washer and dryer were getting rusty - this could be easily fixed\n- We had an incident where we have been unexpectedly locked out by the screen door and since we didn’t have the keys, we had to call a locksmith. This should be a one-time incident only and I hope David will avoid this situation in the future. David offered to pay for the cost of the locksmith to compensate for this situation.\n- Communication wasn’t always clear. I suppose this is because of David’s many guests but there was a bit of confusion when making arrangements. A lot of information wasn’t concise enough and made it hard to keep track of everything.\n\nMahalo for hosting us!"},{"_id":"224337587","date":{"$date":"2018-01-02T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"20789773","reviewer_id":"156308423","reviewer_name":"Yvan","comments":"Spacious and clean!!

Если добираетесь сами, то выходить надо на трамвайной остановке Баязит, перейти на другую улицу, найти вывеску Burger King  и по этой улочке идти прямо вниз, никуда не сворачивая, ища вывеску гостиницы (она будет справа). \nТеперь о самом районе. Гостиница находится на торговой и оживленной улице. Первое впечатление - как будто ты попала на рынок, становится тревожно. Но потом уже понимаешь, что собственно это не совсем рынок - это магазины по оптовой торговле обувью. Я несколько раз проходила по этой улочке одна - все нормально - никто меня за руки не хватал, никуда не зазывал - здесь люди торгуют оптом, потому я как покупатель не особо интересна. Прогулка по этой улице до гостиницы занимает минуты 3. Зато поднявшись до трамвайной остановке Баязит, ты попадаешь сразу в исторический центр (Гранд Базар) и можешь прогуляться по одной из самых красивых улиц старого Константинополя. Пешком минут за 10 (может меньше, очень близко) доходим до площади Султанахмет, где в вашем распоряжении сразу несколько достопримечательностей - Храм Святой Софии, Цистерна Базилика, Голубая мечеть, колонны, рядом тоже Дворец Топкапы. Так что в плане местоположения гостиницы - все очень хорошо. И - ночью тихо, никто не мешает спать. В  5 утра кажется проходит молитва - её слышно, но еле-еле, я просто чутко сплю. Мы жили в номере 401 - на верхнем этаже. Из окна открывается вид на Мраморное море со множеством кораблей и крыши соседних домов.\nЗавтраки.\nКаждый день одинаковые, но очень вкусные. Из горячего - яйца, картофель фри, омлет кажется (вроде без молока, не знаю, но вкусно), чай, кофе. Нарезки - огурцы, помидоры, оливки, маслины, 2 вида сыра, колбаса-ветчина, жареные кабачки и перцы, йогурт, хлопья. В кувшинах молоко и еще что-то типа цветного разведенного сока.\nНомер.\nКартинка соответствует полностью нами увиденному. Мебель неновая, но красивая и добротная, и видно, что дорогая. Матрасы толстые и удобные. Белье чистое и не пахнет хлоркой. Могу только добавить, что есть еще мини-бар, чайник электрический и чашки с блюдцами, тройник (поразительно!).  В ванне на троих человек - 5 тюбиков геля и один шампуня, три кусочка мыла и туалетная бумага. Полотенца также предоставляются. Есть сейф, проверили - работает, я так поняла он предоставляется бесплатно....вот только его к шкафу забыли прикрутить -\n спокойно взял под мышку и пошел. Посторонних и неприятных запахов нет.\nВ целом.\nГостиница очень приятная, тихая, уютная. Соотношения цена-качество оптимальное. Рекомендую данную гостиницу."},{"_id":"217167174","date":{"$date":"2017-12-08T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"20792560","reviewer_id":"156303545","reviewer_name":"Rodrigo","comments":"The host canceled this reservation 25 days before arrival.

The other place was not up to our standards and we requested a refund which he made in cash.  This was kind of him, but still we want things to run smoothly.

It's not like this, at least not in this case. I was arriving at 11PM/midnight and Emmy informed me she couldn't check me in and asked me to find another place where to stay. The problem was I didn't have the possibility to book another room as I was boarding the plane to get to Sydney, and I didn’t want to arrive to a place I didn’t know, late at night, without even knowing where to go to sleep. Luckily Emmy found a solution and I was granted access to the house. I haven’t seen Emmy during my stay, but I saw Patrick, who I think manages the room when she’s not there. They have both been nice and for any issues I encountered they were there to help. The house is a boarding house, so although you’ll have a private room, you’ll be sharing it with other people. The ones who were at Emmy’s when I was there were very nice as well! \n2) The bathroom wasn't too clean and the room was a bit dusty, which made it difficult for me to sleep, being allergic to dust. As I paid a cleaning fee, to be fair, I was expecting a higher standard in terms of cleanliness. If I hadn't paid that, it would have been totally understandable. But again, as it is cheap and they are nice, I absolutely recommend staying at Emmy’s!"},{"_id":"196321268","date":{"$date":"2017-09-22T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"20804897","reviewer_id":"23689075","reviewer_name":"Karolis","comments":"The host canceled this reservation 98 days before arrival.

The unit was lovely and had everything we could have asked for. The view was awesome and we watched many whales breaching off the lanai.  The condo was located right in the middle of two of our favorite beach hangouts so was an easy drive to get to. There was also a great pizza pub just across the road we could walk to.  The beach out front was nice to grab our morning coffee and walk along. Jan was easily reachable when we had a question. \nWe are already planning another trip back!!! \n\nToni Rotar"}]}

If you're planning on a late night out be sure to check that issue with Ken. To be fair he offered me a full refund in exchange of switching a flat. Also, note that the WiFi signal is very weak, and I wouldn't count on it for working or having video calls.

Amazing woodwork that you just don't see in modern construction -- millwork, parquet flooring, gorgeous doors/hardware.  Bountiful towels/linens as well as all you need in the kitchen and bath.  Amazing natural light in the house as well as a HUGE gorgeous architectural skylight in the bathroom means the light switch never needs to be flipped during the day!  :)  The hosts were always available and super sweet.

Andrée’s den/office was so practical that my husband actually worked too much most days, but then I could get out and shop and visit Outremont‘s many beautiful parks with our daughter and new baby grandson. We pushed the stroller up to the top of Mont Royal a couple times too. I loved the proximity of Mile End and Plateau. We walked there easily (coming back by Uber). To go downtown we used the metro, a 10-minute walk away.

Andrée was such an excellent, attentive host. Once I arrived, she took the time to show her house and to provide tips on places and events. The kitchen is stocked with pots, pans, and dishes so I had everything I needed to cook my meals. She also made sure everything was fine during my stay. I needed an iron board and iron for a business meeting and she gladly made them available. I really enjoyed staying in a traditional French residential neighborhood with several options of groceries, restaurants, and shops. The apartment is well located, close to the blue line station Outremont that takes you downtown in thirty minutes. It is also relatively easy to come from/go to the airport (about $30 uber trip). The apartment has paid laundry (four loonies) in the building basement so it was a perk not to leave the building. Unfortunately, I came during the winter so the days were cloudy, snowy, and gray so I didn’t have the chance to see the greenery Montréal is famous for. The city wasn’t quiet, though. Montréal en Lumière was taking place on Avenue Sainte Catherine during the weekend so I was able to check a famous city festival.

The flat is spacious, and well layed out.  I had a presentation to write and I found that the balcony surrounded by pine tree branches was a perfect place for that (though Andree also has a nice office).  The neighbourhood is great:  quiet tree lined streets with brownstone houses (some villas around Outremont park are particularly beautiful), and excellent cafes and restaurants within walking distance.  Metro is just under 10 minutes walk, and so is Dax cafe for a morning espresso with pastry.  I went to a conference at the HEC Montreal, and it was 20 minutes door to door.  Andree herself is lovely and welcoming.

The host kept complaining for arriving late and was even not happy about our early leave. I asked her about late arrival before booking and she still invited me to book this place. After the late arrival happened, I apologized and explained to her a lot of times, but she just kept complaining to us, and was even blaming us for early leave... said this ruined her weekend plans... I mean if you have plans for the weekend why inviting us to book your room? Why even put on the availabilities on Airbnb? We were not staying at your place for free, we paid to stay but we did not feel welcomed at all. Felt like we did something wrong just by staying at her place..

It’s a very rustic place that’s very well kept. I felt very comfortable there, and there was a sweet homey feel to it. I’d definitely recommend staying there if you’re willing to walk or commute to the downtown area. \nOtherwise, the area itself has many great things to offer!\nAndrée is also a great hostess.

The location is great, 5 minute walk to the beach and a bus stop to bondi basically outside of the flat. Jenny gave us milk and bread for when we arrived, we arrived to Sydney at 7- so this was amazing ! The place was super clean, and had everything that we needed. Jenny replied to messages so quickly which was really appreciated, she gave us fresh sheets and towels after the first week. There was air con and heating which is great as Sydney does get cold at night time. I really recommend staying here, it’s great for the price in a amazing location and really comfortable.

A small shop just across the street provides you with basics, but Jenny even ensured that the fridge was not empty upon arrival.\n\nThe apartment is cosy, and you‘ll find everything you need. Wifi was stable, which is always important, if you also have to work. Cars can be parked on the streets for free. \n\nBronte beach is a 5 minutes walk away, and less crowded (and thus more lovely) as Bondi. But the Coastal walk connects all Eastern suburb beaches, which is really great and nice hike. At Bronte you‘ll find nice cafés for having a coffee or great breakfast.\n\nI would definitely recommend Jenny‘s apartment, and actually I already did! \nThanks again, Jenny!"},{"_id":"281471357","date":{"$date":"2018-06-25T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"20865085","reviewer_id":"171535262","reviewer_name":"Elen","comments":"Blissful Bronte was such a beautiful place to say.

The place/amenties/furniture were all lovely and immacutely clean. A walk from bronte  to bondi is must. Jenny recommended having lunch at the Bondi icebergs (casual bistro area) which we did. We are so glad she told us about it as we had no idea you could eat there and it was lovely with a beautiful view! It is also super easy to get transport from the street or beach.

We made a Costco run before arriving but there is a Foodland market and  restaurants about  a mile away. Because of the major flooding in April we weren't able to explore the coastline after Hanalei which was one of the main reasons for staying on the North Shore.  In hindsight and on our next visit to Kauai we would probably stay somewhere more centrally located as we really loved Waimea Canyon (two hours away from Princeville) or maybe split up our accommodations.  Larry responded in a timely manner and we would stay at any of his places again.

Princeville is a quiet area, and perfect if you're going to do a lot of golfing or hiking. The host was great. \n\nThe outdoor covered porch was perfect, and we spent quite a bit of time out there to escape the heat inside the apartment. We slept on top of all the covers most nights. Wouldn't book this location again due to that reason alone, unfortunately."},{"_id":"341402369","date":{"$date":"2018-10-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"20865183","reviewer_id":"12374064","reviewer_name":"Sandy","comments":"Great location in Princeville and well stocked with beach gear!

The unit is priced reasonably low for the nature/style of living space, and grounds, pool and hot tube are nice. People seem to follow quiet-times rules, but can be noisy in early morning hours. These are tight units, with shared walls and floors, small living/lounge areas.

If you have back or neck issues then you probably shouldn’t stay here.
