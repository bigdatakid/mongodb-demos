Chris goes ABOVE AND BEYOND to make your stay amazing.  The studio is by far the CUTEST Airbnb I've stayed in.  The interior is so thoughtfully put together and designed.  It's beautiful and welcoming and spotlessly clean.  Chris generously provided snacks and refreshments, which was extremely generous.  Communicatiom was superb throughout - Chris is such a great guy and you can tell he tries to make your stay as comfortable and hassle-free as possible.  At the very end of our stay, we were fortunate to meet him because my boyfriend had forgotten some clothes at the apartment and Chris reached out to us to return them.  Throughout our stay on Hawaii (travelling around), we stayed at 4 different Airbnbs and this was by far our favorite.  Stay here - you won't regret it!

They were very helpful and accommodating with telling us where to park during our stay. Also, they provided all essentials needed at their condo plus more. When my fiance and I walked into the condo, we noticed that Chris made a special welcoming letter addressed specifically to us. Chris even went above and beyond by providing us with snacks for our stay.  To blow us away even more, the place was very clean,  cozy, and romantic as it is in close proximity to the beach and local restaurants on Kalakaua Ave. Thanks again Chris for allowing us to stay at your place.

Just wanted a fun relaxing long weekend on Oahu. We found Chris and Julie's studio PERFECT! \n\nWe arrived at the Honolulu Airport. We decided to save money by taking the city bus.  Walked a short distance to the bus stop on the upper level.   Less than a 10 minuet wait. For bus 19 (20, 42). If you are not in a hurry, the all day pass for $5.50 is the way to go (unlimited use for the day). The bus drop us off at Kalia Road which is less then a 2 minute walk to the Inn on the Park. \n\nWe found Inn on the Park location perfect for our needs. Located across from Fort DeRussy Park and the Waikiki Hilton.  An easy walk to almost every part of Waikiki. An ABC Store less tan a 1/2 block away. Bus stops less then  2 minute walk away.  A Cheeseburger Waikiki and Waikiki Brewing Company to the left as you exit the building.  To the right 200 yards an IHOP.  Ala Moana shopping center 3 bus stops away. \n\nYour checking in the lobby at the security office.  Found it to be very fast, helpful and friendly. The studio is on the 6th floor. Just right of the elevators. No long walk down arrow dark hallows to find your room. Once, the doors of the unit close behind you. You will never hear the elevator again.  The lobby and 5th floor have free WiFi. But,  you will need  a passcode. \n\nMy husband and I found Chris' unit to be ideal for your needs. The unit was clean, fresh decor,  A/C  was already running and the room cool (nice)! Chris and Julie had  a nicely filled mini refrigerator with  cold water, soda, beer and even a bottle of wine.  They had beach towels and even a beach bag for our use. There is a large flat screen TV with over a 100 channels (which we had no use for. We can watch TV when we are home), Microwave, coffee pod machine. The bathroom has both bath and shower in one.  The bathroom was very clean. No mold anywhere (which is hard for Hawaii). The unit is  not overly large. We wanted to be able to see all of our belongings at a glance. Certainly, we had no plans to  entertain there.   The is a very nice relaxing view overlooking Fort DeRussy Park. We wanted a place to stay that was  safe, clean, centerly located t Waikiki,Ala Moana Shopping Center, the bus system we found it all here. \n\nChris and Julie were perfect. Every question was answered quickly and we never heard the word  \"NO\". This is a great place to stay. \n\nThank you once again Chris and Julie you two are  Amazing!!!! \n\n"},{"_id":"318551608","date":{"$date":"2018-09-03T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"25953244","reviewer_id":"134386588","reviewer_name":"Sai","comments":"The location of this Airbnb was amazing—one block from Waikiki Veach!

The place is more spacious as expected on the photos and the location is amazing - right by Darling harbour! Gabbie responded to queries very quickly, which was very helpful. Unfortunately the fridge wasn’t working properly, however she managed it super well and even got a new fridge within 1 day of telling her. Very impressed! I would highly recommend this place, the only thing which is a bit of a shame is the lack of natural light (as buildings are built so close to each other in Sydney) and the main bedroom faces the hallway within the building, however if you’re not planning to be indoors all day this is the place for you!

What an amazing trip and place! My husband and I took a last minute vacation to Maui and stayed at the Outrigger El Dorado Resort for 4 nights and SO wished we could have stayed longer. We are so happy that we booked through Airbnb as this was our first time staying in one. The management company upgraded us to an even better unit and it was beyond our expectations! The unit itself was right by the lobby and check in was a breeze. There was always parking even though we went during high season. The unit was HUGE for 2 people! It was very clean (which is an absolute must for me) and well decorated. The kitchen was stocked with great kitchen appliances and tools and this particular unit even had a full size refrigerator with built in ice maker and filtered water. I don't care for out of the tap water so this was a great bonus! We didn't have to buy bottled water. The bathroom area was well lit and spacious. The shower was large and it was so convenient to have a washer and dryer in the unit. We were able to always have fresh, clean towels to use and we went home with 90% clean clothes in our bag. We also loved that though the cabana down by the beach offered beach towels, we had our own beach towels in the room which we were able to take on a day we visited a different beach. The patio lanai was huge and had great extras on it like 2 sunbeds, and even a cooler and boogie boards for the beach. We had a grill to use though we didn't since it was a shorter trip. It would have been amazing to grill on our balcony though. This unit had a gorgeous view of the golf course and ocean which made sunrise and sunset just amazing. The Hawaiian breezes through the screen door made it that we didn't even have to run the AC in the evenings or all night. My husband doesn't love sleeping in AC air so this was perfect. The walk to the beach was shorter than expected though my husband and I are athletic and enjoyed the walk. We took the complimentary golf cart ride to and from the beach on a particularly hot day and that was super convenient. The grounds are immaculately kept and it is just beautiful to walk around the resort. I liked the beach cabanas though we used it less than we thought we would. It was really nice to have a bathroom and kitchen option right there. The bathroom was really well kept and clean. May's Beach which is where the cabana is located was not super populated which almost made it feel like a private beach. The sand was smooth and the water beautiful. We enjoyed the pool and hot tub area twice as well. Again, for a busy time of year, there weren't..."},{"_id":"302629653","date":{"$date":"2018-08-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"26014383","reviewer_id":"26928217","reviewer_name":"Tyler","comments":"Place was awesome and loved the resort!

On the plus side, the Wi-Fi is top of the line fast.\n\nThe listing also says there is a view. Maybe I just have different expectations of what a \"view\" is but you only see other buildings out the window. It's not bad... But I would definitely not qualify that as a \"view\".\n\nThe kitchen is not really a real kitchen and it's hard to cook in it. I kind of gave up after a couple tries...\n\nBut the host was super responsive and accommodating. Very professional and organized. The check in/out process was super smooth and convenient.

Someone is trying to make money without putting in any effort.\nBefore we arrived we got a page full of rules we have to stick to (like \"clean up after yourself\" which should be a given) but apperantly nobody else does. We were the only short term guests (there seemed to be at least 4 long term guests) and found the kitchen and bathroom in a desolate and run-down state. The bedroom was okay but the sheets and towels did not smell good.\nWe mentioned the dirty bathroom to the host twice but the only reaction was to put up a sign pointing out the obvious: that nobody was cleaning the bathroom and that everyone should clean up after themselves.\nAt times there was no toilettpaper and we saw a roach in the kitchen. Also some of the other people staying there had dogs in their rooms, which I think should be mentioned, in case you are affraid of them.\nThe walls a paperthin and you can hear the other guests alarm in the morning (4 am), watching TV, talking on the phone or taking a shower in the middle of the night. The \"corner room\" we stayed in is right by the street and without any black-out curtains the lights from the cars light up the room at night and you also get a lot of noise.

Lynn has a service dog too which was very cute. She does have few other guests staying at her place and all of them were very welcoming. It was cool because the forest was just outside the gate. There is a waterfall close by which you can take a dip once a while. I did jog every morning along the road during my stay there. I was sad to cut my stay short there.\nI would say, this place is perfect for a bachelor or a single traveller who is not too picky or doesn't mind pets or the occasional bug. This room is not for family or a couple I guess. There are other rooms in the house which might be suitable for fmaily. Again, the house is old.

Also an easy walk to the mountain and to the Mile-End. Sophie is an excellent host. She was a great communicator, and made sure everything was perfect. Check in and checkout were seamless. The apartment is stylishly decorated with a lot of personal and artistic touches that make you feel right at home. A beautiful private patio and garden make for wonderful dinners or gatherings outside. Books, music, board games are also at your disposal. Perfect apartment if you are travelling with Kids, or just among a group of friends. Bathroom has all amenities at your disposal.

We also really appreciated how accommodating she was, as we weren't able to leave Toronto until after work, and didn't get in until 11. Just a couple of things to keep in mind if you're booking Sophie's place however:\n- the description currently states that there are queen beds in each of the bedrooms, and a pull-out in the common area, but this isn't the case. There is a large bed in one bedroom, a small bunk bed in the other room, and no couch. We were two couples, which made the sleeping arrangements quite awkward.\n- the apartment has a very lived-in feel, with lots of stuff everywhere. This makes it feel very homey, but if you're used to Airbnbs that are more sparse, and don't feel like you're in someone else's space, then Sophie's place is not for you. For instance, the bunk beds were in a childrens' room that was tidy, but filled with toys, etc., which along with the bunk beds didn't feel appropriate for two adults to sleep in. It had also been a long time since I had stayed in an Airbnb without a lockbox for the key, or a keypad, so arranging for the check-in felt more complicated than usual. \nI would definitely recommend staying here due to the location and beauty of the building, but I think these are important things to consider if you're thinking of staying here, especially if you're more than two adults.

The place was clean and ready for us to stay in when we got there. The only thing I would change is we were asked to replace toilet paper/paper towels/detergent when it's empty which we don't feel is necessarily our responsibility. In our case, the detergent was empty when we got there so it didn't seem fair to make that request to us.

Me, i like to try anything but I had a hard time looking for food for the \"old\" ones with me. When I say old, I'm talking about 52, 60 and 66 year olds!  So it's understandable for them to be really picky. hahaha They love the bread though! (what a relief) :P \r\n\r\nThe place was clean and air condition was cold!

Like what others had mentioned earlier, the toilet maybe tad small for bigger build individual but that was alright still to shower both my girls together. Had clarified prior to arrival on the availability of an iron but this was not provided. It would be good to provide one to as it would be a more completed home stay. Would not expect a washing machine to be around as there is a laundry service provided by external party few streets away. It would be a bonus if these 2 items are provided and it will be a mini suite under Melody's rented units. Suggest to include a couple of cute plastic cups/mugs to make entire unit more welcome for kids. Talking about the vicinity, the unit is located in the heart of Mongkok and just the street behind it's the Ladies' Street where I had done some great shopping. It can easily be accessible to her unit 2 streets away from the mtr, about 7 mins walk for us with 2 big luggages and 2 very young children. No regrets staying here. My younger girl keeps asking me to go \"home\" (on level 2 - it's where the unit was) as she loves to climb the ladder to go up the upper decker bed.

The place is as clean as you see in the picture. For the room with the double bed, it may just be a little narrow to place bags/luggage by the bed. But luggage can be placed in the hall so it isn't much of an issue. The water heater takes some time to heat up, especially for those coming over in winter, Melody told us about this before she handed the keys over as well. We bathed in intervals in between to wait for sufficient water to be heated up before the next person.\r\nAs for the location, it is really just a street away from Ladies Market/Fa Yeun Street/Argyle Centre.

No towel provided, but perhaps it's better not to share towels (luckily Women Street is just downstairs, so we can quickly grab some cheap and nice towels)."},{"_id":"31166186","date":{"$date":"2015-05-03T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2612849","reviewer_id":"7239779","reviewer_name":"Saimun","comments":"Cosy place in the centre of MongKok."},{"_id":"31395084","date":{"$date":"2015-05-04T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2612849","reviewer_id":"26896659","reviewer_name":"Alfred","comments":"地铁和巴士站近在咫尺,出行十分方便｡附近都是商业街区,购物也方便｡下次还会考虑入住"},{"_id":"31487176","date":{"$date":"2015-05-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2612849","reviewer_id":"31967670","reviewer_name":"Rachel","comments":"Very convenient location for shoppers.

I assume that she lives in the building somewhere though since she came by quite often without much warning of when she would walk-in.

Communication with Melody is extremely great, obviously. 5* for communication. \r\n\r\nOne thing I/we consider in finding a place to stay is the location. Melody's Flat is very strategic! This flat is highly recommended if you're into shopping (hello sneaker lovers)! Her Flat is 3 minutes away from Mong Kok subway station (Exit E2, also next to bus stop A21), which is very convenient for us. Restaurants including street foods are all over the place, so you wont get hungry.  5* for location.\r\n\r\nAnother thing is the cleanliness. THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AT LEAST FOR US. Melody's Flat is very clean. The rooms and bathroom are in order. We have no issues with bed bugs or stinky smells. The room is bright, thanks to the white and cute walls :) 5* for cleanliness.\r\n\r\nThe Wifi is good to cater four people. The air conditioners is cold especially in early morning. The water heater is very strong, so be careful and don't go to the extreme. The water pressure is also strong. 5* for amenities.  \r\n\r\nOur lively experience in Hong Kong will not be completed without a great place to stay. Do not get deceived by the appearance of the building, it may look old but it is 101% safe. What more can I ask? Melody's flat is a must especially for tourists.

It was tiny as expected. My main issue was the noise. I understand about the neighbor noise, the walls are thin. You really do hear the neighbors. But I guess what no one else has added in their reviews were there are karaoke singers on the street below every weekend and they are loud! Like the whole street is blocked off and singers are lined up below each with their own mic. They are there every weekend and don’t close shop till 11pm when the stores close. Otherwise Melody’s flat is very centrally located. It is the most active and crowded area with the Ladies Market, shops and restaurants. The area and the building does seem shady but we never felt unsafe. We didn’t see any bugs inside the flat, but did see a few rats in the building. I also found it bothersome the cleaner had to come into our flat on three separate occasions to get stuff out of their cleaning closet. Luckily we were out and about at those times. Otherwise Melody was a good host, very quick on communication and the flat was as expected for HK standards."},{"_id":"254741659","date":{"$date":"2018-04-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2612849","reviewer_id":"42183722","reviewer_name":"Wai Kan","comments":"The place is near to Mongkok station and quite a lot bus station along the road, so no need to worry about the transportation when you stay here.

Very close to the train station and Temple street market. Plenty of places to eat and shop nearby. Wai Hung is a very good host, he met us from the bus stop very early in the morning, 6 AM, to greet us and show us the place. He even showed us a local breakfast place and let us check in very early in the morning. \nThe room is small, but so does every other room in Hong Kong. It is enough for my wife and I to stayed there for 3 night, but probably better suited for a solo traveller. There is no kitchen and no washing machine, but probably not really required if you are here for a short stay. The bathroom is located opposite to the bed and does have a small damp odour smell, but it will be gone once you turned on the air conditioning, which by the way is really good even for a hot summer day.

The apartment is located in an old very nice renovated building (around 15 minutes walk to the city centre). I liked the high quality and modern design with around 6m high ceilings. The communication was fast and always friendly from the beginning till the end - i got a late check out until 5pm. As i am used to sleep in a very silent area it was a bit too loud for me (1st floor, located next to the street with quite some traffic). In addition it was raining - so even louder than usual. And the Wifi did not work for the whole stay - but that was not so bad as i used my mobile roaming connection. If you like a stylish modern apartment its really a good choice i can recommend."},{"_id":"357488726","date":{"$date":"2018-12-10T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"26232410","reviewer_id":"47006582","reviewer_name":"Cristina","comments":"El apartamento es como se muestra en las fotos.

The apartment had just about anything you might need.  It had a homey feel to it that we really enjoyed.  The laundry in the building has some good machines, which washed and dried my clothes well without damaging them.  Coin machine is sometimes out, so I would recommend getting some rolls of quarters at the bank instead.  Ratana was always very responsive to any questions we had, and even offered to pick us up at the airport and take us grocery shopping.  Didn't take her up on it, but it was very kind of her to offer.  Overall we really enjoyed our stay and recommend it to any long term guests on the island.

Close to the beach, has covered parking, beautifull views, central A/C. Clean and modern. It is the complete package. Besides this Ratana is the the best host you can have and very acommodating to any request.

Excellent place/location.  I wish I was able to give 6-star!\n\nI have stayed here for months, and I wish I could stay longer. This is my place in Waikiki from now on. \n\nHost:\nRatana is very kind, thoughtful and professional. She has responded all my questions promptly and even went far and beyond by bringing me a teapot since I was just simply asked if she had. She knew that I was coming late night, so even she made sure to have some food in the fridge for me. I have been an Airbnb guest for years, and it is very rare to meet an outstanding host like her. She is genuinely kind, helpful,  and thoughtful. You feel yourself staying in the family.\n\nLocation:\nMinutes to everything. It is at the heart of Waikiki. You can walk to the beach in a few minutes, groceries, restaurants, coffee shops around you. There are rental bikes, scooters, bust stop next to the complex, and it is wonderful to talk by the ala wai canal by looking at rainbows. There is a new Denny `s American dinner/restaurant opening here and it will be open 24-hours and most ABC stores around here are open until midnight. Enjoy Farmers Market every Saturday which is 5-minute walk. You are neighbor of Marriott and Hyatt Hotels and they have very nice lobbies, starbucks, and shops inside. Feel free to have your business meeting there. It is 3-minute walk to the home.\n\nNot for from/to HNL airport, you can take uber/lyft and it is 18 minutes away. \n\nHawaii Kai is 15-minute,  world-famous snorkeling place Hanauma Bay 20 minutes, Kaulia and Lanika 30 minutes away. There is much more must-go places to list here. \n\nParking: \nI had a rental car during my stay, and it was convenient/safe to park here at Ratana`s designated covered parking spot. The building also has guest parking for your guests which is rare in Waikiki.\n\nSafety/Neighbors:\nThe building is very safe/clean and neighbors are nice/talkative. Mostly, locals; expats and I see a lot of people using these condos as vacation homes. And they are not around for the most of year. The building has security guards/cameras 7/24 and they always walk around. Your family would feel super safe here.\n\nCondo/Building:\nSuper clean, full of sunlight, roomy, well decorated and the kitchen has more stuff then what I a have at home lol. AC works perfectly in the entire place. Pictures may mislead you; the unit has an actual separate private bedroom and large living room. A family of 4-5 people could easily and comfortably stay here.\n\nThey have a very nice swimming pool, barbecue and sitting area, and jacuzzi / hot tub. Laundry rooms are clean, works with your visa. Plenty of washers/dryers for $1 - 1.25 for each load.\n\nOnce again, I wish I could stay longer. This is my place in Waikiki from now on.\n\nThanks."}]}

It got a bit hot since there’s no AC , there’s a tall fan in the bedroom but we ended up buying a fan which was not a problem at all. People mentioned road noise, which there’s plenty during the day, but we didn’t hear any at night. The building doesn’t have an elevator but it is well kept, super clean, laundry room, the pool was perfect, clean and super refreshing at night. We also met the night security guy, who was super nice. The beach front was a bit rocky but we managed to get in there a few times. Kitchen has all the basics, we love to cook so used it a lot. Tatiana is super sweet and had chocolate and little gifts when we got there, she made us feel very welcome. Definitely recommend this place!

If you ever wanted a get away and have everything with no one to bother you, then this is it. We wanted to see the real Hawaii, not the touristy part, and west side of the island has a lot to offer. \nWe have had our best experience staying at this place for our whole trip. I will start with amazing hikes that are just minutes away from the condo: mount Ka’ala (the highest mountain on the island of Oahu with breathtaking views), Ka’ena point trail (where you get to see seals and if you’re lucky enough sea turtles. Overall very easy trail). West side has one of a kind beaches just to name our favorites: Yokohama Bay(with crystal blue water, heavenly stretch of sand and no weekday crowds), Kahe Point aka Electric Beach(best snorkeling I have had. The beach is by nearby power plant, and the pipes attract lots of sea-life). \nThe condo itself was magical and very romantic. If you get to stay here go to lanai and check out the sunset with your other half, was the most mesmerizing experience. It was very clean with all the amenities. A/C was a plus, but we really preferred sounds of crashing waves. We found a hidden beach to the right of the building, pretty awesome. There is Tamura’s market 5 minutes drive from the condo, where we did most of our groceries. \nI recommend this place to anyone who is seeking to get away from touristy Waikiki and experience real Hawaii!"},{"_id":"311685635","date":{"$date":"2018-08-21T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"26315238","reviewer_id":"134831524","reviewer_name":"Katerina","comments":"Had a staycation there.

There is a fair amount of noise from the street and the surf, but earplugs are provided and we slept well in the comfy bed. The best part about this condo was the view from the balcony of the surf and sunset, which, in January, sets directly in front of the condo complex. The condo is also near several nice beaches which were far less crowded than the ones at Ko'Olina resort area (although those beaches are nice too and worth a visit). Pokai Beach has a protected area safe for swimming in winter when the surf is dangerous at other west-side beaches. Although there is bus service on the road right outside the condo, it is nice to have a car in this area since the restaurants, grocery stores, beaches, and other amenities are spread out."},{"_id":"401972506","date":{"$date":"2019-01-16T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"26315238","reviewer_id":"83139655","reviewer_name":"Anna","comments":"The place itself is peaceful and quiet, far away from busy and touristy places.

I slept with open balcony sliding doors this way you can hear ocean waves which was an amazing  experience! It is a good place to rest and rest, relax and enjoy Mother Nature.

Unit has an AC, everything updated and clean, bed sheets and towels look and smell brand new. We visited with kids, so we cook a lot, we had everything handy to cook (a lot of brand new cooking hardware) which is a big plus! Property has amazing spot to cook BBQ it literally right in front of ocean, here is the tip - do it at the time of sunset, truly magical views:)property has parking spot plus when ever our friends come they just sign in and live a car with overnight option at no charge(free overnight parking) which is a huge plus because they usually charge us money everywhere on the island. \nTatiana was amazing host, right after we arrived we found some Hawaiian gifts  and souvenirs for us, it is really heart warming welcome and Aloha!

We were skeptical of noise after reading few reviews, However, I was sleeping like a baby and it was quite during day and night hours. Big thanks to Tatiana for hospitality and souvenirs!

The place looks even better then pictures that posted on listing. The host was very kind. I never have seen  place that has everything from beach towels, bottle opener, tooth pasted and tooth brush, small gifts(special thanks to host) to kitchenware and a lot more stuff. Place was sparkling clean and had a fresh look. I found a great beach to swim and it was only 7 minutes walking distance to the right side from property. The coolest thing is that there is no crowd at the beach and you have all those ocean spots around to yourself that was a big difference after tourist places like Waikiki. Another nice feature that I loved was a swimming pool with ocean water.\nStuff that works on property site was really friendly and helpful and made me feel like home! I would love to comeback to this paradise location! Big thanks!"}]}

Dominique is a really nice person, communicative and kind, but I'm sorry to say that her place, though functional, is not recommendable for anyone who doesn't fit the young , college student and extremely easygoing or on a budget type. First of all, the apartment has an awful smell of cigarrete all around, even in the sheets and blanket. Worse than that, there's an occasional terrible smell of pot, I don't know from where or whom, so not making any accusations, but it's bad indeed.  The neighbors are extremely noisy, they listen to loud music the whole day and night, and when there's no music there's a girl singing NONSTOP after midnight the same song over and over again (out of tune as hell). It is impossible to sleep due to the noisy old heater, who sounds like a painful flute glissando (and I'm a heavy sleeper). So this is the night routine: when there's no music and people smoking marijuana, there's a loud girl 'singing' and when there's no girl or music at all, the heater makes the night an awaken's hell.\r\nI don't get it. How can this list be entitled \" Beautiful room \" ? Was it \"functional room\" or even \"convenient location\" it'd be more honest. But it is far from beautiful. The building is old, filthy, there's graffitti all around INSIDE THE BUILDING, in the walls and even in the doors of the units. So the feeling is you're entering a really unsafe zone where criminals get easily inside the building to damage the walls and doors and God knows what else. However nothing unusual happened during my four days stay, I didn't see anyone suspicious, in fact the neighborhood is almost entirely composed of young harmless people, and the worst you can see is a bunch of drunk folks screaming and wandering around the streets.\r\nI rented this place because I thought I could save some money after travelling for 3 months with my companion staying only in good hotels or private apartments. Now that I'm alone for a brief period of time I thought some saving would come in handy, but I guess one gets what one pays for, so I'll never stay in a room again and already moved to an apartment.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm glad to have met Dominique. If you don't mind the lack of hotel-like standards, this is definitely a great option for you."},{"_id":"28239519","date":{"$date":"2015-03-20T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"263190","reviewer_id":"28247862","reviewer_name":"Kristina","comments":"Dominique was incredibly helpful and efficient in responding to my request! The space was exactly as described with a flood of sunlight during the day and a private entrance in and out of the room. I read about other visitors concerns about the smell of smoke, however I only encountered it when I would pass by that neighbor on the walk up, so it really wasn't as bad as others had made it seem. The neighborhood itself is located near some fun bars and restaurants and the walk to the subway stops were definitely manageable. I'm so grateful Dominique was able to set this room up on such short notice!

The other room however was rented out most of the time so you will never know who you're living with - if you're fine with that. Seems sometimes a bit of a basic boiler room to extract max profit but it is what it is. Internet is shared with the neighbours and can be as slow as to be unusable if you need it for work. \r\nThat being said there is a lock on your door to the general area so there's privacy. I got the air conditioning installed so you should be fine with staying cool in summer. It's nyc so lower your standards exponentially for living in general and in this tenement style building - 5th floor walk up, and small cockroaches but if you're flexible its a fine enough crash pad but it's bare necessities atm. There's room in the fridge for your food, towels,  but maybe the room could have less of hosts personal items to create more space for guest.

The building entrance may look old but the apartment is renovated, well equipped and sparkling clean.  The hosts brought us up by lift and ensured we are settled in the apartment.  All our queries throughout our stay were answered promptly,  including where to buy certain things, and they even helped to call a taxi for our early morning flight out of HK.  The pocket wifi and local mobile phone were a big help for us.  The apartment is cosy for 4 adults, we managed with 1 big luggage \u0026 2 smaller ones.  It has all the amenities of a hotel, what's better than a hotel are the 6kg washing machine, lots of hangers to hang laundry, big fridge, microwave and a hot water dispenser.  After a whole day outside, you can come back in the evening to do your laundry, they will dry the next day inside the apartment.  \nThe apartment's location is perfect - walking distance to many famous eateries (eg Kam Wah, Hong lin, Tsui Wah, Hang Heong, roast goose/meat stalls),  Mongkok MTR just minutes away (Prince Edward/YMT stations are walkable as well), shopping areas (Ladies Market, Gold fish market, Langham Place etc).  There are many local sundry shops and fresh market downstairs to buy local dried seafood, herbs, chinese sausages,  fresh fruits even fresh meat if you want to cook; and a shop selling hot steamed rice with meat, variety of dim sum, dumplings, buns is right downstairs operating from 6am till night time.   No need to venture out of the area to find food or get all your shopping done really, we only used the MTR to go for sightseeings beyond Mongkok.\nA good experience overall, highly recommended."},{"_id":"352240070","date":{"$date":"2018-11-25T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"26342079","reviewer_id":"83443901","reviewer_name":"胡","comments":"房子真的很干净,我们住的很舒服,房子虽然不大但住五个人刚刚好,不会很挤,位置也很方便｡特别是房东人特别好很热情,还推荐了美食给我们,十分感谢｡如果有机会再来这边玩,或许还会选择入住这里｡"},{"_id":"354540807","date":{"$date":"2018-12-02T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"26342079","reviewer_id":"33283729","reviewer_name":"Tina","comments":"麻雀雖小五臟俱全又乾淨整潔的住宿"},{"_id":"355646133","date":{"$date":"2018-12-05T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"26342079","reviewer_id":"218311344","reviewer_name":"Astrid","comments":"The location is right in the middle of MongKok.

He was very helpful to us throughout our stay. The property exceeded our expectations (first time Airbnb users) and was as listed. We are a family of 6 and managed without a car pretty well, Fernando's house is a 5-10 min walk to shops and beach, about 25 min walk to Mindelo metro station. The metro is direct into Porto (about 30 min) and you can get to the airport with one line change. We found Mindelo town quite spread out but local shops and takeaway were good and Restaurante Rubens Dunas was very good with big portions."},{"_id":"42648957","date":{"$date":"2015-08-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2634829","reviewer_id":"24123375","reviewer_name":"Yoann","comments":"Nous avons passé 15 jours formidables dans cette maison.

The beach is also a short walk away, with a boardwalk between different beaches.  It is about a mile to walk to the metro station - very pleasant walk - that takes you into Porto.  Fernando is an excellent host and the house is equipped with everything you would need for a family holiday.  The kitchen if fully equipped and there are also toys and activities for children.  We had a wonderful, relaxing 12 days here.  We decided not to hire a car, as we wanted to 'go slow' and have a restful time; we found we didn't need to go far and were very happy going to the beach or being around the pool, so we stayed in Mindelo the whole time apart from a day trip to Porto.  The result is that we are all very rested and had a wonderful time!

The host and her family are genuinely kind-hearted and ready to make your stay the best it can be! Attention to detail, clean, and cozy were some of the things that jump to mind when I think of the cute pineapple surf shack. It is everything as described and more. Easy access to the turtle beach or Makaha beach where surfers ride the waves every day from dawn til dusk. \n\nThe snorkeling gear was provided and everything worked perfectly. I saw 3 green sea turtles at the little secret turtle beach just up the street. The outdoor showers were so wonderful that I didn’t want to use the indoor one. \n\nThe best part was walking just steps from the front door to get a relaxing and much needed therapeutic massage from Naomi. The massage room was wonderful and the massage put me in the right place for the entire time. Highly recommend a stay at the pineapple surf shack any time! Thank you Naomi! We loved everything about our stay and will certainly be back.

Off the beaten track from touristy Hawaii, but with beautiful beaches within walking distance.  The space itself is beautiful and very comfy with ample AC and amenities.  This family is very gracious and hospitable, and Naomi made sure to communicate with us to make sure we knew how to get there, and to find out how to help us in other ways.  At the same time, they gave us space to be alone and freedom to use  their beautiful patio area as well as for our kids to play in the tree house and on the tire swing.  We felt very comfortable and welcome there, and also felt that our hosts knew how to balance hospitality with privacy.  These are GREAT hosts.  Plus, it's less than an hour from the airport with lots of beautiful scenery all around.

We (family of 3) were there for 5 nights. Naomi is an outstanding host. Very generous with her family's personal stuff (snorkel gear, boogie boards, beach chairs, umbrellas...). Her hospitality was amazing! We would come home to find goodies (tropical fruit and flowers) waiting for us. She was also generous with her time, showing us around, walking us to the local beaches, sharing local tips for shopping, eating and sightseeing. From before I made the reservation, her communication was great. Super quick responses to our questions. The amenities were amazing, did not need for anything. The guest house was super clean, cutely decorated with pineapples and surfboards. There were fresh flowers and fruit waiting for us when we checked in. The patio area is charming and so relaxing and the outdoor showers (there's an indoor one too) were crazy cool! Loved it! Location was great on the beach loop. A quick 2 minute walk to a great cove for swimming, surfing or boogie boarding, or just sun tanning. Makaha beach is also right there. Tons of great beaches around. Best location if you want an amazing massage too.  If you are going to the West Shore of Oahu, this is the only place to stay!"},{"_id":"314524267","date":{"$date":"2018-08-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"26365192","reviewer_id":"28024968","reviewer_name":"Margaret","comments":"Naomi's place is a home away from home with an added benefit of it being located smack in the middle of paradise.

She made sure we had everything that we could have possibly needed. We traveled to Hawaii with our 3 small children. Naomi had toys in the space for the kids to play with (which were a lifesaver!) and she had sand toys, chairs, umbrella, snorkel gear, and a wagon available to us, basically everything we could have ever needed for the beach! She put a pack n play with fresh linens in the space for our baby. Plenty of room for our family of 5! The air conditioners were amazing! We probably wore them out haha! The only negative that we found was the bathroom doesn't have a fan in it so after a shower it steams up a lot in there! BUT The outdoor showers were great for cleaning off all our kids and not tracking all that sand inside the house. And they were very refreshing. Great backyard and patio area that the kids could run around in and that mom and dad could relax in. Naomi even brought us fresh fruit from her garden to try! Our kids loved their dog who was super friendly and not loud at all. The two beaches that were within minutes of walking were some of our favorite beaches that we visited our whole trip (and we went to a lot!). Naomi was super helpful and quick to answer all of the questions we had. We loved staying with this family! Despite it being out of the way of everything, we would definitely stay with them again!"},{"_id":"325821594","date":{"$date":"2018-09-20T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"26365192","reviewer_id":"1131374","reviewer_name":"Vita","comments":"We absolutely loved our stay at the Pineapple Surf Shack.

The back porch area was so nice.\nWe really wanted to see the sea turtles and she sent footage her son took.

Staying there was an exceptional experience. Naomi and her family were perfect hosts, thinking of everything, and yet available for any questions even though all was thought of beforehand. We were greeted in person with kind smiles of welcome. Naomi thoughtfully provided delicious muffins, coffee and fruit for breakfast the morning after our late evening arrival from Los Angeles. Much appreciated! \n\nThe guest house is exactly as advertised, two comfortable beds in a spacious bedroom with a large living room and kitchen. Sofas, chairs, and nice tables made for a sweet place to rest after beautiful Oahu adventures. Solid air conditioning in both spaces kept the interior comfortable. The kitchen is well-equipped with everything we needed to cook many meals. A large flat-screen TV is nice and the provided Hulu is a thoughtful touch. Naomi thought to leave every accoutrement necessary for comfort. Every time I looked for something to make life easier there it was. The yard outside the house is beautiful with chairs and a beautiful tree. My son also enjoyed the supplied yoga mats for his after-surf routine, and the outdoor showers were sweet!\n\nOur group consisted of my 17 year-old son and 16 year-old daughter. They are avid surfers and Naomi supplied sweet short and long surf boards for them. They used these boards every day for all five days of our stay and she even supplied board wax!\n\nThe house is in Waianae on the west side of Oahu, near Makaha. This is not the touristy part of the island. It has a very local feel and vibe. It's quieter and beautiful. There are plenty of activities though so you're good to go. My son heard stories about surfing Makaha from Greg Noll himself and so we made a pilgrimage for that purpose. My son had a blast surfing at that iconic break and both my son and daughter loved surfing Waikiki as well. Gorgeous Makaha Beach is a two-minute drive or a short walk from the house for easy access to the sand and waves.\n\nThe drive to Honolulu or North Shore is about an hour, but beautiful all the way. We made these drives a number of times and loved the journey each time. \n\nOverall, a wonderful experience. If you want a quieter, more local Oahu experience I highly recommend the Pineapple Surf Shack. Well done, Naomi. Mahalo!"},{"_id":"346472529","date":{"$date":"2018-11-08T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"26365192","reviewer_id":"7266689","reviewer_name":"Anne-Lyse","comments":"Un vrai petit paradis!

The location is great for those who want to avoid the touristy areas and convenient to the BEST BEACHES on the island both walking and driving distance. Secluded, softer sand and great waves. Food options are limited, but with a rental car, that shouldn’t be an issue. The west side has a reputation for not welcoming tourists, but we found everyone to be extremely friendly.

It was super clean and perfectly laid out for our family of 6. Naomi has thought of every detail!! The sitting area is so cute and comfortable, the bedroom is perfectly laid out, extremely clean and comfortable, the kitchen is stocked with everything you’d need for cooking/cleaning and the details and amenities she has provided were perfect and so helpful for us during our stay. And to top it off, she had a pineapple and muffins for us upon our arrival to welcome us to Oahu!! Naomi, provided a detailed list of nearby amenities and restaurants, as well, she is extremely informative about beach locations and excursions offered in the area. We enjoyed the amazing outside showers everyday and were so appreciative of the beach amenities she provided, as we also used these everyday as well!! Additionally, she’s extremely prompt on responding to any and all communications as she’s right on site - which was perfect for us. We couldn’t have asked for a better host, a better accommodations, or a better location! We walked to the nearby beach (a 3 minute walk with little kids) and got to see sea turtles sun bathing on the beach!!! You can see the ocean from the driveway and hear the waves crash at night as you relax on the gorgeous patio area. And the kids had a blast every morning playing with the tire swing and treehouse! We were so sad to see our trip come to an end, but are so happy for the amazing memories we’ve made as a family, and absolutely look forward to our next visit to Oahu and our stay with Naomi at her amazing Pineapple Surf shack.

The interior is thoughtfully and tastefully designed with plenty of space for a family of four and grandmother.  A/C is a major asset as many places don't offer it.  It is also perfectly located  - near Poipu Beach as well as shopping and restaurants.  The beach chairs, towels, cooler and beach umbrella were great to have for our beach days.  My teens enjoyed the fitness center and the pool too!  While we saw buildings going up, construction was absolutely no issue!  All in all Pili Mai 2 L is a perfect place to visit paradise!

We were welcomed with a bottle of wine, chocolates, bread, milk, fruit and other goodies and were allowed an early check in and late check out. The house was clean and kitchen filled with everything you might possibly need. The balcony had a gorgeous view and we loved that we felt we were in a mini rainforest. My only piece of feedback would be that the main bedroom should have had blinds, it was really hard to sleep in in the morning with all of the natural light. But otherwise 10/10. We thank you for welcoming us into your home and being so flexible and accomodating."}]}

A unica que tem está na sala e mesmo deixando as portas abertas não chega nem proximo de esquentar os quartos. Passariamos frio se nao tivessemos comprado um calefator por minha conta.
