She responded to my messages very quickly and she was always so friendly. When we arrived to our room there were fresh fruits, wine, and box of delicious cookies! The room was clean and just amazing. It exceeded our expectations. There were an abundance of fresh towels, soap, shampoo. The kitchen had a nice big fridge with complimentary water. We had cooking supplies and cleaning supplies. The bed was sooo comfy! The view from the balcony was simply wonderful and on Friday night we had a front row seat to the firework show. The location is great. We were close to many restaurants and shops. There is a big mall called Ala Moana mall that is about 10 minutes walking distance. Also if you are into sushi there is a great sushi carry out restaurant called Aloha Sushi that was so yummy! The price was good too! I could go on for days about how pleasant our experience was. We will only have good memories of Hawaii and we would not have been able to do so with the help and hospitality of Annie. I hope this room is available the next time we travel to Hawaii. If you choose this room you will NOT be disappointed I promise you.

The set up of the apartment is great - sea views from a spacious balcony, full kitchen facilities etc.  The air con worked perfectly and the bed was comfortable.  Annie provided yummy cookies, water and fruit on our arrival which was great after a long flight.\r\n\r\nWe did have an issue when we first arrived with the cleanliness of the apartment - there was a thin layer of dust over most surfaces (this can be explained by a building site under the hotel so difficult to avoid), and certain areas, e.g. lamps, light fixings, ventilation grills, photo frames etc were quite dusty.  Annie rectified this by sending the cleaner around immediately for which we were grateful.  Don't get me wrong, the 'important' areas e.g. kitchen counters, fridge, bathroom, bed linen were spotless.\r\n\r\nThe Ilikai itself is centrally located and has all the amenities nearby - food , drink, entertainment, beach etc.  Sounds obvious, but just ensure your expectations are set accordingly - this is a condo in an apartment block, not a brand new 5* hotel with all the amenities, services and facilities (and cost!) that go along with it - if you do that I think you'll have an enjoyable experience from the outset.\r\n\r\nAnnie is great as a host - really helpful before hand and while we were staying at her place.

In the afternoon and evening we could see if pool was busy or not from our room.  It was so convenient!  \nParking in all of Waikiki is cumbersome but there is valet parking that is $28.00 per day, self parking garage next door which was $20.00 per day, and around the marina it was a $1.00 per hour.  \nWe will definitely stay at Annie's place on our next visits.

I always worry about bed bugs ans other unwelcome pets but Annies place was 100% bug free. In addition to that the home is well appointed and VERY comfortable, absolutely perfect for the two of us. The kitchen was well appointed will all we needed for prepare our own meals for the days we opted to do so.  The dark out shades made sleeping in very easy. \n\nExtra touches: It was nice Annie has snorkels and other beach goods available. A welcome fruit basket and water was a sweet surprise.  \n\nThe Location: Ideal, we opted to try this trip without a car, no problem. Uber/Lift from airport (which Annie provided discount codes for) Walked to Walmart, future target, the mall and Diamond Headmall. Tons of food right out side. View of ocean and Hilton bay from the bed and balcony.\n\nThe host: Amazing host very communicative but not intrusive. Provided very clear check-in instructions, as well as a handy list list of local eats and other info. \nOffered late check out which which gave us basically another whole  day on the beach. Very quick responses.\n\nThe short of it, we highly recommend  Annie's place."},{"_id":"182447814","date":{"$date":"2017-08-14T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2989860","reviewer_id":"37377305","reviewer_name":"Karee","comments":"Great location, easy walk to Alamoana shops, lagoon, beach and many options for eating close by.

I think they're unbalanced. However, with Annie and her unit, there's literally nothing I can say that isn't a glowing endorsement. Annie herself is the epitome of a gracious host....there's nothing she won't do to ensure your stay is perfect. From arranging an airport pickup, to renting out her personal auto (which is a beautiful Lexus SUV you can rent via Turo), to securing a parking garage spot just steps from the unit, our stay was logistically superior and on par with a 5-star hotel. The unit itself is pristine. The decor is upscale, plush hotel-quality towels, designer toiletries, a fully appointed kitchen with complimentary local snacks, gorgeous ocean views, and...oh my, the BED. My husband and I absolutely love the bed. After a long flight from Philadelphia, arriving at Annie's felt like home and a much-needed respite from the business of surrounding Waikiki. Comfortable, extremely clean, design-centric, phenomenal location. Five stars for Annie and her awesome AirBnb."},{"_id":"192999942","date":{"$date":"2017-09-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2989860","reviewer_id":"143753049","reviewer_name":"Chieu","comments":"The Place:  very nice place in good location (ocean view from balcony, only minutes waling to beach) very quiet when I stayed which was very good as its next-door neighbor, Hilton Hawaiian Village, is very busy and quite noisy, particularly those on lower floors (I know as I stayed there last December).  Furthermore, the price for this place is much lower compared to its neighbors (Hilton Hawaiian, the Modern, the Prince)\n\nThe Host:  Annie is very nice.  I had some trouble with the faucet in the bathroom.  She promptly came, and worked hard to get a handyman to fix it for me.\n\nIn summary, this was my first time with Airbnb.

Our favorite acai bowl place (Tropical Tribe) is also right across the street which made breakfast really easy. Access to other places is easily done with a car rental or Uber. The balcony has a great view of the beach and also let us enjoy the evening Hilton luau shows every night.\n\nThe space itself was delightful and perfect for a traveling couple.

We loved sitting out on the balcony in the mornings looking at the lagoon and ocean and all the beautiful palm trees as well as having dinners out there in the evenings enjoying the amazing Honolulu weather. \nThe place is in a great location, inside a beautiful hotel. I felt like I was walking into a resort. Hotel has a few restaurants right there and a convenience store downstairs which helped when we needed little things like sunscreen, tylenol, etc. Really fast elevators too (which we appreciated after reading reviews for other air bnbs in Honolulu that had really slow elevators). There is a pool available, although a bit small for the amount of people using it.\nThe view, the location, and the comfort level that Annie provides is worth the cost.\nI would highly recommend!"}]}

It's a place to be when you don't want to be labelled a tourist. A place that you can soak up Barcelona authentically, in an authentic neighbourhood ... but still close to transport so you're in the main city quickly - if you need to do the 'tourist circuit'. Every part of the apartment was excellent, and the host's attention to detail impressed me. Quality fittings, lovely views, sunny aspect, clean and well appointed for cooking meals. We felt 'at home' and comfortable ... and Alex, Javi and Pilar were excellent at communicating with us, and very helpful.

Con respecto a una de las habitaciones dobles, señalar que aunque la cama es de 135cm, está pegada a la pared y resulta un poco claustrofóbica para el que duerme de ese lado, además de que una de las almohadas cae delante de la llave de la luz y durante la noche al moverte enciendes la luz sin querer. También comentar que cuando hay varios electrodomésticos funcionando a la vez (termo de agua, vitrocerámica, televisión y aire acondicionado) salta el diferencial de la luz, por lo que te obliga a apagar uno de ellos.

Par forcément très calme. On est réveillé par les bruits de la rue. \n\nPar ailleurs, il y a des clochards qui dorment dans la rue, sur des bancs mais aussi le long de la porte d'entrée de l'immeuble. Dans l'ascenseur une note du syndic informe que la porte a été forcée à plusieurs reprises ces derniers jours et qu'il faut faire attention à ses affaires et ne laisser entrer personne : ça ne dégage pas des ondes positives. \n\nDernier point : sur l'accueil : nous n'avons jamais vu les hôtes mais une personne qui ne parlait pas d'autre langue que l'espagnol (ou la catalan...) et qui s'est contenté de donner reprendre les clefs. Pas très chaleureux. Par contre les hôtes répondent vite par mail. \n\nDonc, globalement, c'est un petit appartement propret, pas trop mal placé pour l'accès au métro mais dans un quartier qui n'est pas ce que l'annonce laisse croire. \n\nUn peu trop cher pour ce que c'est (du moins, en pleine saison touristique). \n\n"},{"_id":"93312035","date":{"$date":"2016-08-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2991893","reviewer_id":"27116396","reviewer_name":"Alena","comments":"Host was accommodating and quick to respond to any questions.

We made meals together in the well-appointed kitchen - there are several grocery stores right around the corner - after full days out and about in Barcelona. Getting around is a snap with several Metro stations in easy walking distance and it was a pleasure to get back to a comfortable, safe, and clean apartment that is off the tourist track but in a neighborhood full of shops and restaurants. We really appreciated the well-stocked paper products in the kitchen and bathrooms, the comfortable beds, lots of storage in the bedroom closets, and the super fast and reliable wi-fi. We enjoyed a world-class musical one early Friday night at a theater only five minutes walking distance from the apartment. Check-in was a breeze. Alex answered all of our questions and even ordered taxis to the airport for us on the day we checked out. We couldn't have asked for more.

There is secure parking, but it is VERY tight, and not meant for minivans.  It was somewhat amazing that I made it in and out without any damage to the vehicle.  The apartment is in a decent area, close to metro stops and good restaurants, especially in Poble-Sec, but going a few blocks into El Raval it gets a little scuzzy and I would avoid at night. It is a pretty easy mile walk to the old town/plaza Catalunya area.  The apartment is nice and clean and very functional if not luxurious. One bedroom with a larger bed, and two smaller bedrooms with beds that can really only sleep one adult/teen. The couch can be used as a bed, although not overly comfortable. Two nice bathrooms. Washer and dryer very convenient. Kitchen area was very nice, and the hosts even left some beers and cokes.  Nice little supermarket just 2 doors down.

It is not huge but ideal for 4 or 5 people with every amenity you need. The communication with Alex was excellent at all times. Pilar is a gem. What a lovely helpful lady. We wanted to take her home with us. There are lots of restaurants nearby, the Tapas street was a 10 min walk, the train station is 5 mins away and the Sant Antoni market 5 mins away too. The parking was essential for us and with an ever enthusiastic Pilar guiding us into the tight parking garage, all was safe for our stay. We appreciated the free beer,coke and biscuits and Pilar even paid for our coffees at the cafe below when we arrived earlier than expected! Not her fault...ours!

Good elevator, secure doors, nice view from the penthouse. Great A/C. The fridge even came stocked with a few beers, cokes and waters. No less than 3 grocery stores in a 3 block radius.\n\nPilar greeted us and couldn't have been nicer. She spent time showing us the whole map of Barcelona. Location was stellar; close to Metro stops, 15-20 minute walk to La Rambla. Neighborhood seemed very safe, lots of nice little shops everywhere. We had the most fun on Blai St, which is a walking street full of tapas bars about 10 minutes walk in the Poble Sec. La Tasqueta de Blai! Highly recommended. Closest metro stop connects right to the Mt Montjuic funicular for a fantastic view of the city and the old castle up there and surrounding parks. To save money, consider riding up and walking down through all the gardens. \n\nThe Passieg de Gracia is the area where the Gaudi house and Casa Mila are located, and is a beautiful wide walking street. You will be absolutely amazed at the amount of street cafes. \n\nAlso, the L3 green line is at the closest stop, Paral.lel, and it connects directly to the Aeropuerto Train for 4.60E. Little did we know the Gay Pride parade was scheduled for 5 PM on the Paral.lel two blocks away. Entertaining if you're open-minded."},{"_id":"290328674","date":{"$date":"2018-07-14T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2991893","reviewer_id":"7460870","reviewer_name":"Amrita","comments":"The apartment itself is compact but well appointed with plenty of room for atleast 5 people. All the amenities are modern and well maintained and we appreciated the child friendly crockery and cutlery as well as the fact that there were basic food supplies as well as thoughtful touches like the cold beer and other beverages for us in the fridge. \nThe apartment is a stone's throw away from interesting bars and food places and commuting was not a problem at all. \nAlex was wonderful enough to agree to babysit our children for one evening when we made a last minute plan to attend the JayZ/Beyonce concert in Barcelona and he also ended up helping with our laundry and dishes as well. Such a treat!\nThe one thing I would ask future occupants who are driving a car to be aware of is that the parking space in the garage is extremely tight and it is a very stressful experience parking the vehicle in the space assigned to us. My husband who is an expert driver ended up denting our rental car (remember to always pay that little extra for comprehensive insurance) twice trying to negotiate those turns. \nAll in all, a beautiful, sunny, well ventilated apartment with modern amenities and fabulous hosts.

Please don't go. When I read the postscript on Airbnb, I thought \"How bad is that? It's just a personal difference.\". I thought it'd be a personal difference. But now I understand why they wrote the latter part. Don't filter out the really bad reviews and be sure to read them!! When I saw the riviews of this dorm, there were a lot of comments saying that it was very clean and nice. I didn't get the feeling that it was really good to see from the pictures, but I paid the bill the day before the trip. It was a flight on the evening of February 20th, so I asked my host to excuse me and went in the dorm very quietly in the night. I checked in at 12:30 a.m. on the 21st. I was surprised when I came in. Where I had to put my shoes, there was a lot of dust and I could see hair first. It's not a single thing. It's just that I don't think anyone has cleaned it. Even the smell smelled dull. But I though it's ok. And turned on the light (Website hidden by Airbnb) really different from the picture. Even though it's more dull and has the same structure, it's older. Anyone didn't clean the floor at all. I was looking for a place to stay with my parents because it was a family trip, and when we first looked at this place, my mom said, \"Well...We can clean it up.\" And my dad also agreed. So we tried to clean it up. The two dregs were so dirty that they couldn't be used at all. They were all covered in dust. So I looked at my phone to contact the host and there was an ant on my cell phone. Two of them were walking around on my cell phone, so I killed them quickly. But when I looked at the floor, there are ants. So I looked at the floor to see where it came from.I didn't know because the light was dark and the floor was like flooring with spots on it.

Tomas works on-site and greeted us quickly.  He showed us the place, quickly rectified some missing towels and pointed out some local markets and shops on a map in his welcome booklet.   There was a small tourist tax to pay, which he collected and we signed the paperwork.   \r\n\r\nThe apartment was perfect for our needs (family of 4).  The layout was great; 2 kids in the middle room and adult space (bed/dining/living) on the street side.  The street is quite busy, and sleeping with open windows in the summer months could be an issue (but wasn't for us in Feb). The apartment was clean and bright with high ceilings.  Bedding was comfortable, good showers/bath, etc.   The kitchen was well appointed and covered most of our needs for breakfast and simple dinners.   There was even a well-stocked mini-bar!\r\n\r\nThe location is very central, between two metro stations and surrounded by bus lines - however, it is more of a residential neighbourhood instead of being in the heart of tourist locations, which some people may or may not appreciate.\r\n\r\nWe had some minor disappointments in the lack of some basic provisions that we had to buy (such as a box of facial tissues, paper napkins, kitchen roll and washing machine detergent- for the price, we thought these could have been provided), but on the whole the experience was very good and we highly recommend the apartment to anyone interested in a home-like place in central Barcelona."},{"_id":"73927254","date":{"$date":"2016-05-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2996993","reviewer_id":"27418871","reviewer_name":"Richard","comments":"This is a lovely apartment - I have stayed din many AirBNB apartments over the last few months and this ranks as one of the best.

There are actually views past a neighbouring apartment building to the harbour and part of Kowloon.\r\n\r\nThe apartment was quite small, but for a couple who spent a lot of time out and didn't cook at all it was perfect for our needs. Hosts were lovely and very helpful with suggestions on directions, restaurants and bars nearby.\r\n\r\nUpstairs is a small terrace area with space for washing, and probably a pleasant space to sit — although during our visit the weather didn't really suit. Most important during August, there is *very* efficient air con.\r\n\r\nIt's a roughly 10-minute walk from the nearest train station, but buses and trams stop directly outside and arguably make for a more interesting journey — they're super cheap, too."},{"_id":"17468290","date":{"$date":"2014-08-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3002319","reviewer_id":"815455","reviewer_name":"Whitney","comments":"Cute apartment, good location, close to some really cool areas without being too loud/busy, right next to waterfront which is great for walks - had an excellent stay!!"},{"_id":"17903492","date":{"$date":"2014-08-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3002319","reviewer_id":"12862803","reviewer_name":"왕","comments":"The studio was so nice.

The food around the area is just excellent, with a local style dim sum place right across the street.

We were not aware that you could hear the elevator every time it was in use. The elevator created this loud rumbling heard from both rooms that did not allow myself or my fellow traveling partner to have any good night sleep for the 5 nights we stayed. \r\n\r\nIts unfortunate cause other than the elevator, it was quite a lovely stay.

Everything was very clean and it was nice to have the separate bedroom instead of my friend and I crammed into the one room. The host was very responsive and left great details and tips for the city. Communication was quick and easy. The location is very convenient for buses and trams and not terribly far from the mrt. It was nice being on the main road toward central so most of the transportation went there. It was nice to have the local diner and a Starbucks across the street and it was a nice walk to the midtown area with lots of shops and restaurants along the way. The local dim sum restaurant across the street on the 2nd floor was probably the best meal we had there and it was all locals and quite an experience ..a highlight for sure. Some small details to expect...There isn't much of a balcony on the roof and it felt like we were walking through someone else's space to get to it, so that's not a great selling point.  The walls are very thin so the neighbors woke us up in the morning and the water pressure is kind of low, but not terrible. It would be nice to have some more options for tv or movies, but next time I would just take my computer and stream so that's not a huge deal.

It was very clean and had all the essentials. The Wi-Fi was really poor and was intermittent constantly. Before we arrived I had good communication with Brend and plenty of information, he also gave me notes about the original aircon system not working and a secondary had been fitted and full instructions on how to use it. However, none of the air con systems were working and we had to open the window to try and get some kind of air, this had resulted in myself and my boyfriend being covered head to toe in mosquito bites.

The space is small as it is in a central location in Hong Kong but was big enough for the three of us to come and go.\n\nThere is an elevator which is necessary because the apartment is on the 11th floor. But there are some stairs to climb with bags before you hit the elevator. \n\nThe apartment is a bit further west from the main shops and restaurants of Sheung Wan/Central, but we enjoyed how this apartment was just a bit further from the hustle and bustle. \n\nIt seems that this apartment is in high demand as Brend had bookings back to back. Brend was so accommodating to us by having the apartment cleaned up and ready for an earlier check in. This made a huge difference as we had such a long travel day the day before. Thanks Brend!"},{"_id":"259394561","date":{"$date":"2018-05-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3002319","reviewer_id":"46374983","reviewer_name":"Heather","comments":"Very convenient location, central, close to the subway+bus, excellent for 3ppl, especially if you have one person that needs their own room.  Compact apt but has everything you need.  Tight but clean bathroom.  Shower and sitting on the toilet might be a bit tricky for a big person. ^^;  When we first stepped inside we were disappointed because the place looked outdated, dull walls, with dim lighting, and old linens.  There are many more clusters of stuff laying around which makes the place look different from the photos.  On the bright side, although it doesn’t look as bright and IKEA’ish as it did in the photos, this is still a great place to stay overall.  Clean, convenient, and most importantly, it is not easy to get a separate bedroom for a 3rd person for this price.

Directly across the road is a Wellcome supermarket, and if you  come out of the entrance in the early morning, turn right , and then right again, you  will come to a fantastic local noodle bar where the taxi drivers eat.  Walk around 1km from the apartment and you are at the Star Ferry terminal, walk out of the apartment , cross the road  and turn left and you are at one of the best dim sum restaurants on the island.

Kevin provided exceptional communication prior to and throughout our stay. The area is super safe. The beautification of the upper west side of Harlem is incredible based on how I remember it back in 1989. The building is secure and we were wondering if anyone lived in the building because it was always very quiet. People are super friendly and restaurants, grocery stores, and shopping are within walking distance. My family members live in small studios or one bedroom apartments in NYC so finding this AIRBNB rental was such a blessing to us as a family. We were able to meet up at the apartment to spend time together as a family. The apartment is equipped with everything you'll need to feel like your at home. The strain is within walking distance and catching a taxi is simple. There is a park not far from the apartment if you want to picnic or BBQ. We can write a book about our A+++ experience. Thank you, Kevin!! We will definitely be back.

It was kinda of an awkward situation...maybe because we didn't arrive at 4:30p as we mentioned running late due to train connections, this should not have mattered though unless there was some place you needed to be, also I asked about check-out time and was told it was flexible...we had to ask questions on where we could grocery shop, coffee house, restaurant for dinner, etc. There was no book on what to do or see in the neighborhood, no directions to the subway, or using the condo appliances, etc. The bathroom and kitchen trash cans had not been emptied from the last guests, the refrigerator wasn't wiped cleaned of something that split, there was left over expired food in the refrigerator. It looked like the place hadn't been dusted in awhile. Also, this was extremely gross, the shower curtain was all mildewed!!!! These liners cost $2.00 if that and it's an easy fix! Also, mildew in the corners of the shower as well.\r\nI would imagine if you would like clients to return or spread word of mouth how great the place was, wouldn't you think that you would do a better job of the cleaning and up keep of your place? I asked about check-out time and was told no set time, so my son and I go into the city to return by 3:35p, and I mentioned this to Kev to be told well, I need to be in there between 2:30-3:00p to clean because the next guest arrive at 4pm!!!!! Yikes....had we known in advance than we would have planned our day differently! When we arrived back at the condo to retrieve our luggage, he was walking in with the next guests..the guest were more polite than Kev was, he wouldn't look at us or even acknowledge that we were there, didn't ask how our stay was...nothing! The new guests asked how our stay was and my son and I said great, you will like the neighborhood and they asked if we were taking off I said yes, we needed to catch our (Website hidden by Airbnb) which Kev upon walking by me had some comment to make just loud enough for me to hear!!! And it wasn't a nice comment either!\r\n\r\nSo...whom ever sees this review I hope that you will take to heart what was said above and take action!

(i.e. running hot water, wifi, working washer/dryer, etc.) This put all those to shame. \n\nThe apartment is beautifully heated and insulated. I found myself removing covers when it was only 38 degrees outside. Half the time I didn't realize I had fallen asleep due to the comfort of the bed. The entire apartment is well lit and the water in both kitchen and bathroom heats and cools within seconds. \n\nOverall, I greatly enjoyed my stay here. It was nice to stay in an area that was just far enough away from any tourist traps, but still had extremely easy access to all the events and places I wanted to attend. \n\nI would stay here again for sure and I rate this apartment 5 stars!

It worked out well for us: we put the kids in the two bedrooms so that we could use the rest of the place (living room, kitchen, and bathroom) after they went to bed. The bed in the main bedroom is quite comfortable, and the fold-out bed in the living room is decent. The air mattress is an air mattress, but our 3-year-old was fine with it :)\n\nKev's place exactly matches his description and photos. It's pretty spacious for Manhattan, with great light coming in through the 4 large windows in the living room. Apart from the furniture it's fairly bare-bones: you've got all the essentials in the kitchen and bathroom, but not much else (no tissues, for example), so it doesn't feel as much like a \"home\" as some other places we've stayed. But we had everything we needed and enjoyed eating in for dinner as a family.  It was a nice, clean, comfortable place to stay for three days.\n\nThe neighborhood is great: tons of great shops/restaurants all around you, and a quick walk to the subway, Morningside Park (including multiple great playgrounds for the kids), and Central Park.  The street has moderate noise from buses, trucks, and the occasional siren, but it's pretty muffled in the bedrooms.  We had our car with us and had good luck finding parking on the surrounding side streets.\n\nKev was communicative and check-in/check-out were smooth."},{"_id":"142316052","date":{"$date":"2017-04-07T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3003386","reviewer_id":"111960405","reviewer_name":"Maryelle","comments":"We loved the set-up and decor.

Very quiet street and was able to find on street parking fairly easily for all 3 nights (street cleaning rules require you to move it every couple of days). Two subway lines located within a few blocks. Quiet neighborhood, but neighbors hanging out on the stoops give it a nice and safe vibe. Check out 116th street around the corner and all the African restaurants and stores!

He was very gracious and even allowed me to drop off my bags early and officially check in later. \nOn the first night, which was quite cold, I experienced a notorious New York loss of heat. I alerted him in the morning and he came to help and determined the cause was a building wide boiler shutdown. He was very attentive to the issue and purchased space heaters for a temporary solution. \nThe apartment was in a convenient location for upper west side locales and close to subway stations and bus lines. It is a short walk to the cathedral and Central Park and many good restaurants and shops \nThere was plenty of space for 2 or more guests with 2 bedrooms and a pullout sofa in the living room. It had a decent sized kitchen for cooking meals if one chose to. \nThe only down side is it is on the third floor of a brownstone (without an elevator) so I would take that into consideration when booking if not traveling light or one has an inability to climb stairs. \nAll in all, it was a good experience and I would stay there again."},{"_id":"363870953","date":{"$date":"2018-12-29T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3003386","reviewer_id":"113320166","reviewer_name":"Bruce","comments":"Great location and Kevin was a great host.

Only book if you're willing to take the risk of being homeless midstay!\n\nThe host was unreasonable, appallingly proud and would assume the worst of you. I'm gonna be honest, the place was nice and the location was great, but the host made the experience a nightmare. \n\nI made a booking for me and my dad to stay for two nights. There was a mistake in my part where I booked for one guest instead of two. However, I messaged Nick and told him WE (two of us) were coming. Nick also personally met my dad and me at check-in and he was fine with it. He later requested an extra charge for that (extra guest) and we duly paid. In the beginning, Nick seemed like a nice guy, showing us the place and told us to \"feel at home\" and \"feel free to use the washing machine etc etc.\". We stayed the first night and it was all good.\n\nThen, on the second day, out of nowhere, with no prior communication, we were told to LEAVE the apartment. One of the reasons being that we \"abused\" the facilities. Apparently, using the washing machine and dryer twice is considered abusing the facilities in this apartment. Mind you, we only used the dryer again because the clothes were still damp. On top of that, I was accused of taking advantage of them by bringing extra guests (plural) with no evidence. \n\nNick and his partner would later contact Airbnb and claimed that they saw my parents (plural) and they heard a female voice from their room. I was amazed because I didn't know my mum could teleport. \n\nI also find it odd that the host asked us to leave in the afternoon when they had actually decided to kick us out from the early morning. It became apparent after I realised that I could no longer get a refund for the second night because it had started. They claimed to have felt uncomfortable hosting us but appeared to be more than comfortable to receive the money despite their sudden cancellation. \n\nWe really tried to communicate and cooperate as best as we could with Nick to reach an amicable solution. However, the host and his partner are more than happy to let us be homeless for a night since they've got their money. \n\nI'm not saying that the host would kick all future guests out, but are you willing to risk getting kicked out midstay? Because I won't be the last one. All it takes is for one of them to say they're uncomfortable for whatever reason they may have and there's nothing you nor Airbnb could do about it."},{"_id":"357849687","date":{"$date":"2018-12-12T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"30056291","reviewer_id":"230115984","reviewer_name":"Karen","comments":"This is an amazing apartment to stay in.

There was dirt literally everywhere and it looked like the common areas, bathroom, and room hadn’t been swept in ages. The bathroom had grime and hair on the sink, floor and in the bathtub. The room was supposed to be two queen beds but instead was one twin and one queen and was super cramped and uncomfortable. The room was also supposed to have a “view” according to the listing but all we saw were the neighbors’ backyard as well as a huge pile of random trash. The soap dispenser in the bathroom had soap so diluted with water that we ended up using hand sanitizer to clean our hands. The listing also said it was close to downtown but it ended up being a 45-1 hour trip to downtown one way (bus and then train), and it was super inaccessible. Overall I’m really disappointed because the listing looked lovely and instead it ended up being super gross and really uncomfortable for all of us. Additionally there were a ton of people there and the lock on the door for our room was super broken down and could easily have been opened. I’m also pretty sure that mould/dust in the house is the reason my friend got sick the first night we were there.  \n\nI have stayed in cheaper places that have been nicer than this and it was so awful to have this trip ruined for us. Our friend group was meeting for the first time in over 8 months and it was such a let down as the host seemed really nice and down to earth. We definitely learned our lesson to do more research and to plan further in advance to book a better place for New Years in the future."}]}

The doorman was very helpful, the neighborhood is very safe, and the apartment is close to the metro station, the beach and nice restaurants, markets and bakeries, so you can easily buy things for breakfast at the corner. It has a very quiet washing machine which was really helpful. Melina left us hairdryer, iron, soaps, coffee, beers, water, lots of towels, and many other nice details that made our stay an unforgetable experience. We were very happy staying at Melina' s place, we super recommend the apartment, you won't regret! Melina also gave us important advices before our stay, like the taxi fares, she recommended us some restaurants, and she was very quick and kind to answer our doubts before and while our stay.

Only two blocks from the beach, in a very nice area of Copacabana. The metro is only three blocks away, there is a supermarket a block away and lots of restaurants nearby.

The studio apartment itself is clean, tidy, modern, although we didn't use the kitchen it appears to have everything you could need for any food preparation.  We were disappointed with the lack of communication with our host, but not sure where the blame lay, with Airbnb or host.  We had no instructions as to how anything in the apartment worked, no designated cupboard space and so lived out of our suitcases, and were unable to use wifi, which is desperately useful if searching for restaurants etc.  There was no hairdryer and having travelled from the UK it was not something I had packed. This was our first time using airbnb and so we had no idea what to expect, on arriving in the apartment our initial reaction was - oh lovely - but there were a few niggles which because our visit was short were not worth worrying about.  Should we use airbnb in future I would be more questioning and more alert as to our requirements, small things enabling us to leave our destination thinking \"that was a great holiday\"."},{"_id":"35065992","date":{"$date":"2015-06-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3013158","reviewer_id":"6973485","reviewer_name":"Sophie","comments":"Nattie's flat was in a great location.

Gym just a few blocks away. The place was very, very clean. The AC worked very well. We never worried about theft to our unit (there's a deadbolt lock besides the regular lock). There was a little noise from the halls and above, but nothing out the normal from any flat one would find. Our only frustration was the limited linen (only one towel for the other two guests I was travling with). There was a combined W/D, but the instructions were incredibly difficult and the guide left in the booklet to our flat was not every close to helpful. I ended up having to take laundry out to a laundry service which was not open most of the day. The host was also poor at responding to texts about concerns and questions via the (Hidden by Airbnb) (which they insisted we use). Overall, a wonderful flat and experience though.

The host's associate met us at the apartment and gave us a tour of the place.  She showed us to just pull the front door closed behind us when we leave the apartment, no need to insert the key.  On our second day at the apartment, we came back at 9:30pm to find out that a burglar had robbed us.  All the doors and windows were closed and no sign of forced entry.  I called Barcelona police and the host right away.  The host showed up conveniently after the police had already left and was not empathetic to our situation and directed us to speak with our home/traveler's insurance.  The host told us that we should have double locked the door when we left the apartment, which we knew nothing about.  As I did not feel safe continuing our stay at the apartment I found one room at a close by hotel to accommodate 3 adults for 3 nights.  We handed the keys to the host and left.  I requested a refund from the host for the 3 nights we did not stay at the apartment due to safety concerns, but the host has declined to refund me.  To say the least, it was a terrifying experience which ruined the rest of our stay in Barcelona.  I have contacted Airbnb for assistance, and I'm waiting for their reply."},{"_id":"339314485","date":{"$date":"2018-10-21T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3014692","reviewer_id":"209996001","reviewer_name":"Heather","comments":"The apartment was absolutely beautiful!

The major complaint that we had was that we had difficulty getting good sleep - you can hear everything through the walls!  Bring a white noise machine if you are a light sleeper.  In addition, the bedroom windows face out into a strange interior hallway that is open to the entire building so every time a neighbor turns a light on or off the light shines directly into the bedrooms.  Unfortunately, one of the neighbors was up all night during our stay turning lights on and off.

Yes, it's a small space, and only big enough for one (perfect for one!) but there's actually more than enough room because Jordi has designed it so well that not an inch has gone to waste. There is also loads of storage space. You will have everything you need there. Plenty of hot water, super fast wifi (that even works out on the terrace), fridge, microwave, cooking hobs, and washing machine. There are pull-out tables too which I found really useful. It's on the top floor (with a lift - yay!) and it's really quiet. One of my favourite features was the really large terrace. It was a sun trap during the day and with a lovely breeze in the evening. And there are great views too - over the rooftops and into the city and the mountain range. Jordi lives across the hall so it was handy to have him nearby. Jordi is a wonderful host. I had cold drinks waiting for me when I arrived \u0026 Jordi gave me a great introduction to the city and things to do \u0026 helped get me orientated. He is more than happy to share his knowledge and he is really helpful and friendly and a fab neighbour too! Great location with the bus and metro right at the end of the street. Lots of little local shops right on the same street with a fabulous food hall (hot food, meat, fish, fruit, veg) a few minutes walk away \u0026 next to a big supermarket. Plus there are lots of other shops nearby too! I walked into the city and it took me about 50 minutes to La Ramblas so if you fancy a stroll, it's walkable to the city. It's a great location in a residential neighbourhood and I felt very safe on the streets day and night. Less is certainly more when it comes to this penthouse and I am so glad I made this choice \u0026 recommend you do too! Jordi - thanks again for everything \u0026 I hope to be back again soon :) \r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"_id":"20502908","date":{"$date":"2014-09-30T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3019711","reviewer_id":"5467459","reviewer_name":"Betty","comments":"Jordi emailed me detailed directions on how to get to the apartment so I arrived without any problems.

The neighborhood suited me well - very convenient to public transportation, making local excursions very quick and easy, while also NOT being a tourist-oriented neighborhood, which I enjoyed. Navigating daily life in the neighborhood was surprisingly fun and easy, given my quite limited Spanish, because folks at so many of the local shops and restaurants were so welcoming and friendly.

The windows downstairs were also drafty, which isn't ideal for a Montreal winter. \n\nAll manageable, but just little things that we had to work around."}]}

We really enjoyed the location, as it was convenient to get to the MTR and walking distance to food, shops, and Times Square.  \r\n\r\nCarina was very helpful and friendly, even providing us with a USP charger and helping us hail a taxi on our departure.  She was quick with responding and good with answering questions.  I would highly recommend this place, as it is a very relaxing and clean apartment - great after a long day in the city."},{"_id":"14635509","date":{"$date":"2014-06-23T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3021624","reviewer_id":"26529","reviewer_name":"Nigel","comments":"The perfect base to explore Hong Kong.

It was a very comfortable stay for four adults and would be for five, too (if two share the double bed). \r\n\r\nIt is located on Lockhart Road around 10 minutes walk to the bar area so you we always had a quiet night's sleep.
