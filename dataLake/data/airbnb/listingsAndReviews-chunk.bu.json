Check in was easy.  The condo was comfortable, well maintained, and adequately equpped.  It's within a 100 yards or so of a great beach, and not far from shops and restuarants.  The restaurant at Kiahuna Plantation is itself very good.    The only problem, and it wasn't much of a problem, is that we could occasionally hear our upstairs neighbors (the unit is at ground level in a small 2 story building, which is part of a larger and well maintained complex).  You should also know that the pool is across the road and so are the tennis courts, which were in the process of being resurfaced, and gym.

It is also near famous snorkeling and diving spots,  so we enjoyed it fully. Finally, you can see on horizont also whales, which was trully amazing experience!

It was perfect accommodation in a great location on Kauai.\r\nThe apartment was clean, presented beautifully and in an ideal position at the resort.\r\n2 members of our group used the gym facilities every day and that was only 5 minutes from the apartment.\r\nWe had a great morning snorkelling out front of the Marriott. We hired our snorkelling gear from the Kimo shack near the gym and shops - cheaper than the snorkelling gear at the Marriott. Amazing fish, very easy location to snorkel. One of the locals advised to go snorkelling before 11.00am and it was perfect.\r\nI would definitely recommend this apartment and location if you are hiring a car on Kauai. Even though it is one bedroom the sofa bed opens out to a queen size sofa bed so accommodated 4 of us very well.\r\nWe drove all the way up North to see the sights and went to the Waimea Canyon - great drive with splendid views.\r\nWe shopped at the Big Save supermarket in Koloa Town as we did use the BBQ facilities at the resort. \r\nThanks for the opportunity to stay at your holiday location through AIRBNB.\r\nAndrea Johnston"},{"_id":"38481477","date":{"$date":"2015-07-16T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4447107","reviewer_id":"24593220","reviewer_name":"Michael","comments":"The condo is a lovely place to stay and to relax.

The condo is located in a well maintained property on Poipu Beach. The place is totally safe, and I had no problem in letting my 7 year old twins running around in the lawn. The kitchen is fully equipped and all the utensils, pots, plates etc are very clean, and we actually cooked inside way more than what I have expected (so since we did not eat out that often, we actually spent less than what I have anticipated :) ). We also used the common gas-powered grills located close to Peter's unit. The lanai (porch) is furnished with a table and 4 chairs and 2 long chaises, and that was a nice touch, since it allows us to enjoy dinner outside, overlooking the beautiful yard, with coconut palms at the end of it.  The nice surprise is that you can actually see the ocean from the lanai too! The condo has everything you have at home to make life easier (hair dryer, bathroom towels, kitchen towels, a sponge with Cascade, dish washer, iron and iron board, broom, TV etc). It was truly a home away from home.\r\nThe beach is so close to the condo. Literally a short minute walk. The concierge hut close to the beach is handy with beach towels and free chairs you can actually take on the beach.\r\nAlthough the pool is not on the same property (you have to cross a busy street to go to it), it is a nice touch. Sometimes, the crashing waves were too much for the children, so we all happily went to enjoy the calmer waters of the pool, where more clean towels are provided, and the pool is equipped with bathrooms, showers, and also a bar/restaurant.\r\nOur vacation in Kauai was simply amazing, and I think that a crucial part for our family was Peter's condo, which made everything easy, effortless and straightforward for us.\r\nThis is a one bedroom unit, with a couch/bed in the living room (which is not ideal), but we made it work. \r\nI would definitely recommend this condo to everyone, and we will be back too one day!\r\nManuela"},{"_id":"64277952","date":{"$date":"2016-03-02T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4447107","reviewer_id":"39033727","reviewer_name":"Lorren","comments":"Very nice 1BR unit in a unique resort that has beautiful flowers and many amenities within the resort.

The beach was an easy walk through gardens and grass. The furnishings were nice too. The louvered windows and shutters made it easy to get that indoor-outdoor melding that makes Hawaii so special. The hotel next door has an outdoor beachside restaurant. Also walkable is a small shopping area with other restaurants, a Starbucks, and shops that supply tourist basics.

Diving is close, the beaches were great, and lots of food/shopping very close by. They complex has everything you need for the beach, including towels and chairs, and lots of rental gear. The place was very clean, and exactly as described. The location of the condo was great, it isn't directly on the beach but one row back, and you can sit on the patio and look out over the water between other buildings and lots of lush greenery - very peaceful and relaxing. The complex is a very family-friendly place.\r\n\r\nThe only thing we did notice is that sound travels pretty easily, even with the shutters all the way closed. It wasn't a problem for us though, the place was very quiet and relaxing. We had a great time and would love to come back!"},{"_id":"122361276","date":{"$date":"2016-12-23T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4447107","reviewer_id":"7103818","reviewer_name":"Eimi","comments":"The place was perfect.

The location is good if you want to spend time at Poipu beach, as it's only a short walk away. Although this is technically a privately-owned property, it's located in a resort that is managed a lot like a hotel. However, there is no mid-week housekeeping service and the pool is across a major road (it's also pretty small and full of children). There are a couple of decent restaurants within walking distance, but you're better off taking a short drive to Koloa.

Peter's place was a great location on the property, right in front of the large grass area ideal for kids to play. The ocean view is just okay...you need to be on a higher unit to really get a good view of the ocean. The room needs some updates, but it's fine for what we needed and affordable. Our main complaint was the poorly stocked kitchen for the basics. No salt and pepper, minimal kitchenware, etc. We went with another party that booked the room directly above us (which was substantially nicer) and we were constantly going upstairs to use their spices, kitchen gadgets, etc. We cooked most of the time during our 8 night stay. The pull-out was horribly uncomfortable...our kids were supposed to sleep on it, but ending up abandoning it the first night. And they have low standards considering they are 2 and 4. Finally, both the porch light and the kitchen table light were out when we arrived. Not Peter's fault and the property managers took care of it immediately, but it was just an added annoyance. We probably wouldn't stay in Peter's condo again, since there are so many other better units on the property. But again, it was affordable and basic...you just may want to check out the kitchen amenities first before heading to the market.

There are not a ton of kitchen supplies, but enough for us to get by when we were eating in.  We spent most of our time sitting outside or at the beach or pool.

Our boys had both struggled to sleep on the plane and were exhausted from the trip (and many plane changes) from Australia and were thrilled to have a place to rest, eat and play. The staff there were extremely accommodating! Once we were able to check in, I couldn’t stop looking at the view!! Absolutely beautiful. As are the grounds of the whole resort. It really is stunning. We were so relaxed there and felt immediately at peace and ease. \nThe condo is small (though not as small as I had anticipated), but I chose it specifically as it is ground floor with a HUGE expanse of grass out the front. The boys were able to enjoy that space to run and explore while we watched from the deck chairs. Very chill.\n\nThe condo was very comfortable and I couldn’t possibly think of a thing we wanted and didn’t have access to- including two soft bathrobes.\nThe beach was only a couple of minutes walk away and we really appreciated the beach gear that Peter keeps at the condo- especially the snorkeling gear! \n\nHighly recommend.

We had stayed on the north side of the island for 6 nights and wanted one night to explore the south. We didn’t realize how difficult it would be to find a place for only one night and how expensive! After we arrived, we wished we had given ourselves at least two nights in Peter’s place!  It was close to the ocean and the grounds were so beautiful with palm trees everywhere and nice grass. We couldn’t get out of the ocean to go see the sites because there were such nice waves!  It was a completely different experience than being on the north. We loved both sides of the island but would have liked a little more time south. Peter’s home was very comfortable and conveniently located. We only wish there were rules about where you could smoke bc we kept trying to sit out on the private patio but a nearby neighbor was smoking and who wants to smell that when you can smell the salty air??

The Sheraton is a short walk along the beach for a cocktail or dinner.  You can walk everywhere, shops, beaches, restaurants.  There are bbqs around for grilling, we preferred to eat out but if we were staying longer would definitely have used them.

It is ideal for a short stay. A small breakfast is included (cereals, few fruits, coffee) and should be eaten on the old chest while be sat on the sofa. Air conditioning is central, so don't expect it to have necessarily a cool temperature. The bathroom is outside the apartment, but close to the room. So you need to get out in a short passage that would normally goes the other apartment, but that is closed with a panel, to enter the bathroom. Because the top of the passage is open, when getting to the bathroom, you need to be quiet to ensure not disturbing the other people. Because that the only water point is at the bathroom, it's a bit complicated to wash the dishes, but Michele offers to wash it with her dishwasher. Communication with Michele is smooth and easy, and overall, it's a good quality for the price."},{"_id":"412147112","date":{"$date":"2019-02-14T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4448723","reviewer_id":"15658493","reviewer_name":"Arthur","comments":"interesting and stylish accommodation that has everything you need and everything you want is close by"},{"_id":"413714068","date":{"$date":"2019-02-18T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4448723","reviewer_id":"186548424","reviewer_name":"Declan","comments":"Michele was a lovely host \u0026 has a terrific space:)"},{"_id":"414497754","date":{"$date":"2019-02-19T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4448723","reviewer_id":"76020436","reviewer_name":"Paula","comments":"Loved the fresh fruit and coffee machine and the bathroom is brand new."},{"_id":"415956182","date":{"$date":"2019-02-24T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4448723","reviewer_id":"39022654","reviewer_name":"Christine","comments":"It is a very clean and cosy room with ensuite bathroom inside the owners family home, but with your own entrance.

The bathroom is very modern and very clean. Bedsheets and towels as well as milk, coffee and cereals provided.\n\nBut keep in mind: If you are looking for a perfectly private accommodation this isn't it. You have your own room with your own front door. However, to get to your bathroom you need to use the hall the family also uses. There is a six-foot high partition in the hall but of course you can be heard/can hear when entering the bathroom etc.. Also not having a sink in your room can be a little awkward - although Michele offers to do your dishes if you send her an e-mail and leave the stuff by the partition. It's kind of like sharing a flat without talking to each other but hearing there is someone next door. Still, the family is very quite so if you don't mind that, it's fine.\n\nNewtown is the perfect location to discover Sidney, many botique shops and hip restaurants - it costs around 3 Aus $ to get to city centre by train; 10 mins walk to the station."}]}

Tane is an attentive host who is easy to communicate with, and quick to respond to messages. The property is set back in the slopes and has one of the most beautiful private roads that leads up to the front gate. The property is exactly as described, on a coffee farm with ocean view on the lanai. The setting is very quiet, and the starry night sky is so peaceful. Tane made sure we got to the property, and kindly gave us tropical fruits, coffee from his own farm, and fresh cinnamon (not to be missed, so real and flavorful, we are ordering more!) He stocked the entire house with everything a family would need. This is the most fully stocked vocational rentals I have ever stayed at.

We must have texted him 100 times. He always responded with tips and suggestions to optimize our time on the island, and to make sure we were comfortable at the house and things were in working order.  We arrived to a complimentary supply of delicious fruit, coffee and cinnamon. When we ran out we were able to purchase more from Tane who delivered fruit to our door almost daily at an excellent price for the island. Tane even delivered a brand new set of snorkel equipment to our door when we told him we were looking for some.  Tane also accommodated a last minute change in our reservation when a tropical storm was forecast for the island. He refunded two days of our stay.\r\n\r\nThe location was a bit more out of the way than we expected, perhaps in retrospect we would have opted for a spot on the water side of the highway, but this spot is unique and in a real, rural neighborhood.  Ideal spot to access points both north and south, e.g. including 2-step, Captain Cook, Volcanoes Natl Park, Kona area. \r\n\r\nIf you are a neat and clean freak, then this place is not for you.  There was dirty clutter that I put out of view and out of the way upon arrival, and I had to clean the kitchen upon arrival.  Dirty and very worn sponge in the sink, no mattress pad on the bed, felt the springs through the sheets, hair in the shower drain, bathroom sinks needed a scrubbing, old and dirty bars of soap, etc.\r\n\r\nTane was very responsive in trying to get the wifi up to speed for us and paying for more gigabytes (or something like that). The wifi worked, but was often slow. It did not interfere with our stay because were were gone all day, but we could not stream movies from our  laptop onto the TV at night as we had planned to do.  If we had needed wifi to get work done while on vacation (not advisable of course! but sometimes necessary), the wifi would not have been sufficiently up to speed.\r\n\r\nIn sum, best host you could ask for, unique and beautiful spot, roomy home, well equipped kitchen, but not for neat or clean freaks."},{"_id":"95224686","date":{"$date":"2016-08-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4449066","reviewer_id":"23506961","reviewer_name":"Leslie","comments":"Our family of 5 had a fantastic stay at Tane's Owl's Nest property! Situated in the middle of a beautiful tropical farm, it was definitely the most unique place I have rented. Inside, there was more than enough room for us all; 4 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, huge kitchen, 2 lounging areas plus a big lanai overlooking nature for dining and hammocking. Furnishings and decor are pretty basic but very comfortable, clean and suited our family perfectly. Plenty of towels, coolers for the beach. Tane left us some coffee and cinnamon from his farm, and fruits and veggies too which were so marvelous. We explored the farm property and wandered up the road at sunset, marveling at the beauty and views and amazing plants and bird songs everywhere. There are other houses and farms nearby but the neighborhood is quiet and secluded. Unfortunately we never met Tane in person; the timing of our exploring and his work did not mesh. But he was very easy to communicate with and checked in with me to see how things were going and if we needed anything. Great snorkel spots and tourist points of interest are close by as is a grocery and places to eat, and Kona is only about a 15-20 minutes drive.

This makes it cooler at night, which is a big plus in my opinion. It's also inside a small working orchard/plantation, which is cool for the kids to check out. Watch out for spider webs when walking around the property. We ate several of the fruit grown there, including lovely passionfruit. The drive up the hill is a narrow one-lane road, which can be a little scary if unfamiliar. But once you get there it is great. The house is (AFAICT) two conjoined pre-fab houses, which makes the layout a bit strange but it doesn't matter: there are 3 large bedrooms and one small one, with lots of good beds (1 queen, 3 doubles, 1 single); one ensuite with shower and one bathroom. Lots of fans: in each bedroom, the kitchen and the lounge. A hammock and outdoor seating on the patio (although occasionally mosquito-y). Well equipped kitchen with gas stove, electric oven, toaster oven and microwave, cold/hot water dispenser and a large fridge. We used the Weber outside, which was functional. Also extra equipment like snorkelling masks/fins are provided. Laundry is underneath the house (not particularly easy to get to), but is functional. Good internet and a large TV which the kids liked.

The house is very specious and really delivers the original coffee farm experience it promises. Nice for kids to roam around on. The complementary organic coffee, special ground organic cinnamon (omg it’s so good, we had to buy more of it) fruits and vegetables are a nice touch, and it’s also great that you can harvest your fresh organic papaya’s and avocados on the premises. Tane (the owner) seems like an awesome guy: he stopped by to say hello, gave us LOTS of great advice for beaches to go to, diners to try, etc. And he gave us a gift of tinctures he had made of passionflower and other herbs to try. The location is great geographically, about (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) feet above sea level, so it remains relatively cool throughout the day and no AC is needed. We also got some awesome tropical showers up there on the hill especially in the evenings, which never last long. Directions are a little tricky and the ones on the Airbnb page lead you to the wrong height and elevation on the road. Here’s the actual coordinates of the house (if Airbnb doesn’t censor them): (Website hidden by Airbnb) Not all paths (Hidden by Airbnb) suggests work, only the one that usually comes up as the default direction. Note also that it’s a little had to get to, especially with lower clearance vehicles. The roosters indeed wake you up as early as 5 am, so I’d recommend bringing a white noise maker (or using an app for your laptop/mobile device to do the same) if you want to sleep in and are bothered by it. I personally like it (as well as the orchestra of insect and frog chirps at night) but some in my family used white noise to sleep in. Now to the suboptimal parts. The place is really basic, i.e., there is not much in the way of luxury (which we didn’t expect and actually didn’t want), but it was also not very clean at least during our stay. The towels and linens and everything is clean (and there’s ample supply of those) but the floors/carpets and walls could use a complete overhaul. There are some areas where it’s just not acceptable, like the moldy walls in one of the bedrooms and the dirty walls and door in the kitchen. What was more problematic during our stay is there were mouse droppings in several area, which made my wife freak out a little because of our 6 month old was starting to crawl, etc. Other things: * The toilet in the master bedroom didn’t flush, so we had to take the tank of by hand and fill it with water, because with 7 people in the house we really needed both toilets. * The refrigerator door didn’t close and we had to keep it shut by moving a door in front of it every time.

The location is nice and remote and not easy to find with conventional navigation systems, but Tane provided us with detailed directions that helped us finding the place. Upon arrival Tane greeted us along with a generous fruit basket, coffee and cinnamon all home-grown on his farm.  Unfortunately I have to say that one of the first things we had to do upon our arrival was to clean the kitchen and several other places as apparently this was not properly done after the previous guests had left. While the beds were very comfortable and the bed wear and linen were very clean too, the overall lack of cleanliness of the place, along with the porch being under construction and the promised wifi not being available (which is tough since there is also no real phone reception), we decided to cut our stay short. From the five intended nights we decided to only stay for two.\n\nIf you are looking for a nice, remote location to relax, with Kona, Ocean View or other nice sights on the west coast in easy driving distance, this is the perfect place for you. If you like your vacation home squeaky clean, it might not be the perfect place, although I'd like to give Tane the benefit of the doubt that the conditions we encountered are the exception, rather than the rule.\n\nAlthough we decided to cut our stay short, Tane was very professional and understanding in dealing with the situation and was a very kind host."},{"_id":"217479714","date":{"$date":"2017-12-09T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4449066","reviewer_id":"1755454","reviewer_name":"Joseph","comments":"The host canceled this reservation 31 days before arrival.

You are located up from the belt road, so it's a bit cooler, and bugs are not at all an issue. Embedded on an organic coffee farm, complete with orange and other fruit frees around, we expected to see our fair share of critters--but aside from an occasional mongoose and a couple of adorable geckos and chickens, not a pest in site. The place ranks on the farm house side. Its layout is incredible and feels a bit like three hales combined into one. Ceiling fans keep you cool, if needed. The kitchen is ample and Tane makes sure you have enough of everything (linens, paper products, water) so that you are completely self-sufficient. He supplied us with complimentary coffee, cinnamon (both amazingly good--we bought 2 more lbs of coffee), oranges, bananas, and strawberries upon arrival. Those items left for us were really the only evidence we had of Tane, who was not at all intrusive; however, he responded immediately on a couple of occasions, when needed (follow his dining advice--it is good). A silent but super hospitable and responsive host. Some other notes: You probably won't want to leave the screened lanai with hot tub (we didn't use the hot tub, mainly because we were fairly warm throughout our stay, but we thought about it every night); if you are a light sleeper, bring earplugs to silence out the ubiquitous frogs who sing throughout the night; drive carefully along the narrow paved road to the property--most of the people living around are locals and also are farmers. On balance, Tane's place is \"rustic elegant\" and we were utterly charmed by it. We hope to return again some day. It is within short drives to coffee farms, tasty restaurants (definitely try the lobster cakes and poke at Fish Bowl), and snorkeling spots, but you don't have to deal with the hype of Kailua-Kona."},{"_id":"247825191","date":{"$date":"2018-03-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4449066","reviewer_id":"178096745","reviewer_name":"Xahil","comments":"If you are looking to get a real taste of Hawai’i Island magic: this is your place.

It's next door to my favorite restaurant in Old Port, Jardin Nelson, and steps away from all the fun Old Montreal has to offer!\r\n\r\nThe apartment was beautiful, spacious and clean. There were nice hospitality touches such as lavender shampoo and conditioner, and no shortage of towels and washcloths. The bed was comfortable, and the Wifi was fast. The place had great temperature controls, Yanick had the AC on before we arrived so it was comfortable right away.  We didn't use the kitchen because we were only there one night, but the set up was beautiful as well as functional and would have been perfect for dining in if we needed to. \r\n\r\nAbout the host: Yanick saved my trip- as all our other accomodations and plans had fallen through- Yanick's message to me that he would be able to meet us early to drop off our bags was a beam of sun in a very gloomy situation! He was friendly and so welcoming when we arrived, he let us leave our things while he finished turning the place over after his previous guests left - and he also let us leave our things when we checked out so we didn't have to carry them around the city all day before departing for good.\r\nWe didn't have problems but he was quick to reach via text for questions that came up. A perfect host! I only hope his place is available next time we come back!"},{"_id":"47803512","date":{"$date":"2015-09-21T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4451485","reviewer_id":"4857218","reviewer_name":"Vincent","comments":"Yanick was very accommodating welcoming me at his place.\r\nLoft was perfect for my stay at the Old Port. \r\nIt was literally steps to the restaurants, shops and attractions Old Montreal has to offer.\r\nI will definitely stay here again on my next visit."},{"_id":"48463807","date":{"$date":"2015-09-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4451485","reviewer_id":"13651039","reviewer_name":"Sarah","comments":"Yanick's place is amazing for anyone wanting to explore Montreal- especially the old part.

There *is* music playing for most of the day out in the square below, but that was the only drawback. Otherwise, the location was excellent: in the center of the old town and close to a subway station, not to mention close to the Promanade du Vieux-Port and the jogging trail along the canal. Yanick was there to greet me at the apartment even though my train was late, he humored my bad French, and he was polite even when we had a scheduling mix up my last night.

Almost everything from towels, to kitchenware and utensils, to free laundry... had all been meticulously prepared for you.  The only minus was that the A/C was not functioning properly during my stay, so it felt slightly hot during the day, but still tolerable since Montreal was getting cold at night during my stay anyway.\n\nHost: Mr. Yanick was very friendly and very quick in replying when I needed help for directions in Montreal.

The location is in walking distance of some of the best tourist spots that even if I had a spent only a day I would have left home happy. The loft is cozy and all the amenities that Yanick provides makes you feel at home. He provides breakfast from fresh eggs, coffee, variety of cereals, fruit and the list goes on and on. For me it was so easy to be able to wake up and have those items available to start the day as it is something that I am use to having available in my home. His home is exceptionally clean which makes you feel as if you are staying at a high end hotel chain. His recommendations on where to visit Montreal turned into my official tour guide. One of the reasons I wanted to visit Montreal was because I had heard such great things regarding the city and people.

KK is an amazing host to recommend us restaurants nearby as well. \r\n \r\nThe flat is very nice decorated, modern and stylish. I would say the flat is very clean, furnitures, toilet, and kitchen are all new. We all feel so relaxed and confortable. I can tell KK put much thoughts behind with his choice of furnitures. The flat is very practical and cost effective for us as a party of 4. We feel safe here as we got asked by the security guard a few times. We even got English TV channels like CNN, BBC, and can play Youtube at TV, and it is a 4K high tech internet TV!!! Wifi is steady and fast, it is a bonus as we cannot survive without wifi. \r\n \r\nI like the sunlight in the day and the night scenes through the windows. Even we are in so central location, being high up in the building make us away from traffic, that we all have a very sweet night sleep. I can tell the mattress is very high quality and it is so comfortable, and my friends mentioned even the soft-bed is so comfortable.

It took us 4-5 minutes’ walk to the MTR, it is soooo CONVINENT and there are already many interesting local stores downstairs along the way to the MTR.\r\n\r\nThe flat is so CLEAN and all the furniture are NEW.

KK was super accomodating and kept us up to date, he even helped us extend our stay at the last minute, I would have no reservation before staying at any of his current or future Air BNB's.

Mr KK분을 숙소 앞에서 만났고, 열쇠를 주면서 설명해준 뒤 직접 문 열어서 해보라고 해주셨습니다. 숙소에 도착한 뒤 간단한 집 소개와 창문가에서 지도(개인 추천 장소를 써놓은)를 보며 위치 설명을 해주셨습니다. 저희가 도착하기 전에 음악, 핫포트, 에어컨 미리 다 켜두셔서 시원했습니다. 공간 활용을 아주 잘 해두셔서 놀랬습니다. 나중에 참고하려고 사진 찍어왔습니다. 펜션처럼 있을꺼 다 있지만 화장실에는 수건,바디워시 밖에 없으니 나머지는 챙겨가시면 좋습니다. 좋은 여행 되세요^^.

I was extremely nervous for this trip as we had never traveled this far as a family with parents before. We choose KK's room based on reviews and decided to go with his apartment due to the following reasons. \r\n1. Fully equipped kitchen - Very Important for a Vegetarian Indian family. My parents don't eat meat hence we wanted ability to cook quick meals. \r\n2. Proximity to key areas - Heart of Hongkong. Very close from all areas. We saw every place possible using MTR and bought the Octopus card which is so convenient. Again a recommendation provided by KK. \r\n3. Trust - Travelling to a foreign country with Kids you need to have a trusted travel advisory/ host who will be available for any questions/ emergencies - KK was very prompt in responding to every single question I had in planning this trip. \r\n4. Travel Recommendations - KK provided us amazing recommendations and detailed instructions to see various places, Dim Sum, Breakfast and shopping. \r\n\r\nThe apartment was a cute Hongkong size apartment. We got used to the size in a few hours and then it was all good. Everything is arranged smartly and the apartment has everything you need for cooking and a comfortable stay. Wifi was fast. \r\nTsim Sha Tsui is a very good restaurant which KK recommended which had very good Vegetarian and non pork and non beef options. \r\n\r\nI highly recommend this apartment and look forward staying here again if I happen to visit hongkong again. \r\n"},{"_id":"69784596","date":{"$date":"2016-04-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4454553","reviewer_id":"40251188","reviewer_name":"Shane","comments":"OMG where do I start you guys!

Сама хозяйка живет в маленькой комнате, когда я жил возвращалась часто ночью, для того чтобы ей пройти в свою комнату нужно было пройти мимо меня, тк входная дверь находится в той самой комнате, где живет гость. самая хозяйка дружелюбная, оставила приятное впечатление, хотя толком и не общались. Для больших и тучных людей комната врядли подойдет.

He even left me a temporary data SIM card for the few hours of downtime (that were not his fault)! He also put together a list of day trips and even kept a few of our suitcases for us while we went onwards to travel the country.

For a family of four, it was really great because we could spread out. The kitchen was also great and had full sized appliances. The beds were dreamy and the location, if you like to be ocean front, was amazing. We rented a car which now in hindsight was only good for heading out to the zoo or back to the airport because parking around there was awful. And really, there was enough to do right around there so we barely used the car anyway. Mal came over and met us and showed us around the apartment a bit. He actually brought us bread, milk, butter and orange juice, which we were not expecting at all. Plus, he gave us a bit of history on the place, the neighborhood, and a bit on Sydney which was great. He was very friendly and we enjoyed talking with a local. Internet was good and there was a washer and dryer on the roof, too, which was convenient. Just get some coins for it. Highly recommend.

Mal delivered sheets \u0026 pillow cases to us at 8 o'clock at night (and a bottle of wine that evaporated very quickly) \u0026 remade the beds after his cleaner let him down on 2 separate occasions. We had a great chat and contact with Mal via AirBNB App or text was prompt \u0026 courteous. As a person who lives in and around the area Mal knows all the ins \u0026 outs \u0026 is very pleasant to deal with. Apartment is right across the road from the beach Bondi is a very funky area with a mix of both residents \u0026 tourists. It is a great place to just chill out \u0026 people watch or to get in amongst it. Each day you will see people surfing off the main beach from dawn to dusk. Many of you will know that the TV Show Bondi Rescue is shot down here in the Summer months. Great walk along the coastline also from Bondi to Coogee Beach (about 8 km). This takes you past the famous Icebergs Pool \u0026 Restaurant/Bar. The walk is well worth doing as is also eating \u0026 drinking afterwards at The Pavillon in Coogee (plenty of food options available \u0026 Gluten free meals as well - try the sashimi you won't regret it) Our daughter is gluten/lactose/MSG intolerant and we found all places that we ate at locally were able to cater for this. We ate at Raw Bar (my girls said best sushi they have had), Porch \u0026 Parlour (breakfast, coffee \u0026 dinner place - great tunes played the night we were there - White Stripes, SRV, etc.). Bondi Hardware (On Hall Street, shared plates/Tapas restaurant - good indie vibe \u0026 acid jazz being played when we we there) Aquabar Cafe (Next door to Porch \u0026 Overlooks Beach - good breakfast \u0026 great coffee) \u0026 Trio Cafe Bar locally. The Apartment itself is as you see it a 1 bedroom with 2 further beds available in the front room (1 bed slides out from under the other). Small bathroom but more than adequate \u0026 clean, has good water pressure \u0026 plenty of hot water for showers \u0026 great WiFi. Fridge in kitchen is excellent \u0026 heating in both bedroom \u0026 lounge also very good \u0026 simple to use. Easily caters for a family of 3 like us or 4 people using both beds in front room. Beds were good to sleep on (main bed is king size). Foxtel TV provided (basic package, so no sports, movies or some entertainment programs). Also DVD player \u0026 Sony sound dock that you can play your IPods/Phones through via Bluetooth. Buses available across the road which can get you to Bondi Junction \u0026 into the city. We used Uber extensively - X, Taxi \u0026 Black. Never had to wait more than 5 minutes for a pickup. Now for the fusspots, these comments didn't affect us nor detract from the great time we had, but some people can be more picky..."},{"_id":"49635379","date":{"$date":"2015-10-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4471162","reviewer_id":"21187446","reviewer_name":"Caroline","comments":"Fantastic location!

Gas heater kept me warm. \nBut the place itself felt a little stark and empty on arrival - no sign of the attractive sofas and colourful rug and cushions, lamp etc that feature in the lovely well-lit wide-angle photos. A couple of non-functional/broken light fittings, some random objects lying around as if forgotten, unopened mail, scrawled-on sheets of paper, a half-full kitchen tidy, the kitchen-wipe scrunched up and a bit smelly...All very minor deficiencies, I know, but cumulatively a little unwelcoming, and not what I’d call ‘luxury’! Also I didn’t realise quite what a busy noisy road the flats are on (noticeable if sleeping in front room) . But having said all that, the beds are comfortable, the sheets and towels fresh and good quality, the view a pleasure, the kitchen really well- equipped, and the roof top a delightful spot to catch some winter sun and sip my coffee.

The position of the apartment is in one of Sydney’s most sort after locations and just moments (2 minutes) walk to Sydney Harbour. The view through to the water past the iconic Moreton Bay Fig tree is tranquil and beautiful. \r\n\r\nThe man himself is a perfect host whom is both easy going and professional. He was a pleasure to converse with as well. \r\n\r\nThe apartment is decorated immaculately in a light and white Sydney contemporary style with controllable lighting, a HiFi stereo as well as a large television in both the lounge and main bedroom.\r\n\r\nThe main bedroom has a view through the trees from the balcony to Elizabeth Bay and is fairly envy making. You can keep all the windows and balcony door open with no fear of intruders due to the height. That makes it an even nicer space to come home to after a day in the sun.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it’s the little details that make this place stand out. Things such as a quality iron and ironing board for business shirts, a washer that come with good detergent as opposed to the cheapest and about a thousand fresh towels. It is effectively a luxury home.\r\n\r\nI had friends over for dinner and we were stunned at the quality of the kitchen equipment as well as the number of serving platters, tumblers, champagne and wine glasses.\r\n\r\nWhen I lived in the country years ago and nearby, finding a car space could take hours. Dino has a car space with electronic entry. It's the envy of the area and a bonus for anyone hiring a car.\r\n\r\nI thoroughly recommend this apartment, which will probably be permanently booked out when people find out how good it is.

It is very close the shopping street of Potts Point, but a couple of blocks away and therefore much quieter.  The flat faces towards Sydney harbour  and there are glimpses of the water, but it is very private because of large trees outside the windows.   The building is also very quiet and I heard no noise from any neighbours.\r\nThe flat is also beautifully designed,  in a modern clean  taste,  with all the facilities one needs for a short or long stay.  It is very well equipped for a comfortable stay with all the facilities one needs for cooking, relaxing and working, with good Wi-Fi.  The flat has the feeling of Dino's own  refined taste, yet with a homely feeling due to books, a comfortable sofa, fresh linen and bedding and a good (Website hidden by Airbnb) covered parking is very convenient and there is also a city bus stop just around the corner.

We arrived in Sydney having been let down only 24 hours before arriving when our previous host gave us a late cancellation. We needed a property that could accommodate five children and Hannah came up trumps.\r\nHannah remained in constant contact with us throughout that stressful arrival day and offered us her house for the week. She was an absolute lifesaver and rescued our holiday. (For the record, Lisa Peterson of L'Abode Accommodation let us down with the cancellation and never inquired about our welfare throughout our stay in Sydney !)\r\nOnto the house, it was beautiful, well equipped and a perfect location. Hannah and her family greeted us on our arrival and made us feel at home. We did not need anything extra and had a fantastic stay. We exchanged a couple of mails with Hannah during the week and knowing she was available was great.\r\nThe shops are close - supermarkets / restaurants and it was quick and easy access to the City. Great spot.\r\nAs I previously said, Hannah went out of her way to assist us and we are so grateful. Her house is perfect and if we are in Sydney again, I wouldn't hesitate to call Hannah again. 10 / 10......\r\n\r\nLisa Peterson of L'Abode accommodation was just appalling. Just imagine arriving in a city 12,000 miles from home (Sydney from London) with a wife and five kids and having no accommodation, with it being cancelled just six hours before you got on the plane, but email and with no personalized apology. Then magnify that issue with a host that just didn't (and obviously still doesn't care). This has really affected my view of Airbnb and I am not an advocate of the process, especially as I appear to be unable to warm other travellers about L'Abode Accommodation. I suppose Trip Adviser might assist but Airbnb should consider this for future."},{"_id":"58778062","date":{"$date":"2016-01-05T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4502957","reviewer_id":"18857099","reviewer_name":"Elise","comments":"This was our first airbnb experience and it has been super positive.

When we arrived, everyone was so happy about the fabulous location, the spacious size of the house and gorgeous garden complete with warm outdoor shower. We particularly liked the way the back of the kitchen could be opened up completely so the kids could run in and out. \r\n\r\nHowever, during our stay we started to notice a few things that didn't sit well with us. These were the issues we encountered: \r\n\r\nthe upstairs toilet would flush during the night (waking us up); \r\nthe flushing mechanism for the downstairs toilet wouldn't flush properly sometimes; \r\nthree out of the four lights in the downstairs bathroom didn't work (which meant we were pretty much showering in the dark); \r\nthe AC in the kitchen didn't work; \r\non arrival we found old used soaps in both bathrooms; \r\nthere were no instructions on how to connect to the internet;\r\nthere was no ironing board, dustpan \u0026 brush, and only one plug for the two baths\r\n\r\nWe got in touch with Hannah about some of these issues during our stay and indeed the bathroom lights were due to be fixed but this never happened. \r\n\r\nOn our final morning when we were doing our final bits of packing, the cleaning team turned up half-an hour before check-out. We had very little warning about this and we felt this particularly unfair given we had two toddlers in the house. \r\n\r\nOverall, we felt that Hannah's house is not being kept/managed to a standard that warrants £326.00 a night. While we appreciate there will always be wear and tear in a family home, this property really needs some attention and updating. Erratic plumbing and broken lights shouldn't come as standard for a property at the price bracket.

And I think I am a lucky one. In the 3 days in HK for my LSAT, I received a lot of help and support from Franco and his family.\nI recommend you to come to Franco's home if you are to take LSAT, SAT, or TOEFL at HKEAA, in San Po Kong. There is a bus stop at the door of Franco's home and you can take the 11D for only two stops(about five minutes), with additional around five minutes' walk to the test center.\nThere are three dogs and a cat at Franco's home. It is easy for them to get familiar with you if you feed them occasionally. One dog named Lubi got so familiar with me that she slept on the floor in my room quietly for a night. I hope she will remember me next time I come to visit Franco. \nLife in Kowloon City is both of traditional HK daily lifestyle and exotic. Many Thailanders live around. HK-style Cafés and Thai food restaurants may just open vis-a-vis across the street. And thanks to Franco, I tried the best restaurants of the best. \nKowloon city is a good place for anyone who just wants to be a flâneur, exploring around the city and experiencing the charming ordinary HK life. And Franco's home is certainly a fantastic place for a rest."},{"_id":"50977508","date":{"$date":"2015-10-16T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4505004","reviewer_id":"31635444","reviewer_name":"Grace","comments":"The host Franco and his family with the dogs and a cat named Ah Fah are awesome!

But thanks to Franco and his family it became an unforgettable time for me. The room is spacious and cosy. I had enough space to rest, sleep and place the luggage and bags in. The nights were silent. I got an own key for the building and room. The dogs are really nice and the whole apartment is clean. I was growing up with dogs and know what kinda work it is to keep a house with dogs clean. I never found dirt anywhere. The bathroom is spacious and comfortable. I was having dinner with the family and whenever I had a question I got super advise. The public transport system in hk is quiet convenient. If you buy an \"octopus-card\" in the airport u can use any transport system with it by holding the card on a scanner to pay. U can charge the card in 7/11 (a supermarket which u can find everywhere in hk). The next MTR Station is just 15 min by foot and the next bus stop is right in front of the door. The area around the apartment got everything. Fresh market, supermarket and many different restaurants with delicious food. If you don't know what to eat, ask Francos mom. She always got nice Ideas and can tell good restaurants nearby. I will definitely choose this room again and whenever I'm in Hong Kong I will visit Franco and his family. Francos room deserve 5 of 5 stars.

The room was comfortable and clean, with (much needed) air conditioning. I joined the family for some traditional Hong Kong meals, which were delicious. The flat was fairly lively, with around 6 dogs in the living room during my stay. However, they were all very friendly and well-behaved, and didn't enter the private room. The location is a wee bit out of the way - my commute into Admiralty took around 40 minutes by bus and MTR - but its a nice area. Lots of great Thai and Korean restaurants nearby, and the Walled City Park is just round the corner. Overall had a wonderful time living with Franco and the family.

Felt relax with Hong Kong island view in main side and pool view in another side. You just need two clothes in your luggage thanks to a washer :). Quite convenient to get Hung Hom MTR by 5-7 mins on foot, but you should ask Dimas the way from MTR to the building carefully in the first time. Taxi stand in the building is very useful for the group of 3-4 people from the airport to the building. A small issue is soundproofing of the apartment is not really good. Sometimes, you can hear sound from neighbor houses and lobby outside. However, it is not important. Last year, I discovered Hong Kong island and this time was Kowloon island.

Complimentary shuttle bus is available from the apartment to Hung Hom station and Tsim Sha Tsui and return. Access to complimentary shuttle only by room keycard. Strictly one card per person. \n\nEasiest way to get to the apartment is by Citybus A21 from airport to Hung Hom station HKG 33 followed by a short taxi ride to the apartment HKG22. Ask Dimas for the name of apartment in Chinese or Cantonese. \n\nThere's a bus stop outside the apartment.. buses to Tsim Sha Tsui, Mong Kok, Yau Ma Tei, Star Ferry and Central. Unfortunately, the bus stop for the return leg is not directly opposite the apartment. \n\nFestival Walk is only 2 stations from Hung Hom station on East Rail line.. very convenient ..

Everything about the apartment itself is very nice. On the other hand, the location is not great. Luckily I've stayed in Hong Kong for a few months and know my way around, as the location is definitely not good. It takes at least 10 minutes to walk to the MTR and then at least a 10-20 minute ride to be anywhere in HK with things to do. Additionally, we were only given one key card, so when we tried to use the pool, they would only let one of us in--obviously we didn't go. Overall, it's a great place; however, know that it's not centrally located and you'll need to get additional keys if you all want to use the apartment building's amenities.

If you are a neat freak (like me) then this is important.  I've had a couple of airbnb experiences before where hosts didn't provide fresh sheets (yes, really) but this wasn't a problem here.  The apartment comes fully stocked with all the linens and toiletries you will ever need.  The place is studio, but it's decorated so nicely and organized in a manner that makes it seem a lot bigger than it really is.  The room is on the fourth floor of a building with no elevator, so keep that in mind when packing.  The stairs were a bit annoying at first, but I actually preferred it to staying on a lower floor having to hear people walk by. \r\n\r\nLocation: Lots to eat.  SO many restaurants.  If you're a wino, you're in the right neighborhood.  Even though you're on the UES, this neighborhood is super cozy.  Also, walking distance to the subway, which provides a straight shot to downtown.\r\n\r\nHost: Extremely helpful.  Never met her in person, but she arranged a very easy key pick-up.  Every time I had a problem, Sara was prompt to respond and helped very quickly.  She also provided a packet of information on good restaurants nearby and instructions on navigating public transportation.  Who does that?? It was super helpful, and was a really nice touch to the stay. \r\n\r\nOverall: I strongly recommend this place.  Sara was a great host and I would definitely stay here again.

Everything was exactly as she described, the apartment was clean, beautiful, comfortable and in an amazing location. Sara was a perfect host- she was responsive, very helpful and accommodating with any questions we had and was lovely to deal with. When we arrived, we had all the information and instructions needed typed out for us with helpful maps and transit information printed, as well as suggestions for local restaurants and grocery stores. She left a beautiful bottle of wine for us to enjoy and luxurious linens, towels and soaps. \r\nThe neighbourhood was perfect and family friendly, easy walking distance to Central Park, the subway and the Met. The apartment was quiet and very comfortable, with great A/C despite the heat wave outside. We would definitely recommend Sara's place for any guests and we would stay there again if visiting NYC.

Really worked to help us out. Thanks Sara! She met with us to give us the keys and left a writeup of details associated with the unit (and a bottle of wine!) The apartment is on the 4th floor with no elevator, but that didn't matter to us. The apartment was great: clean, tidy, surprisingly spacious, and in good repair. There's even a laundry option if necessary. Kitchen looked well stocked, but we didn't use it. We kept the AC on 24/7 and that kept the room at a very comfortable temperature from typical NYC summer heat and humidity. No doorman, but the area seemed very safe and the downstairs door was secure.\r\n\r\nThe location of the apartment is excellent. A short (~7 minute) walk to the 4, 5 and 6 trains which connect to pretty much everything. Lots of restaurants, pubs and bars in the area. A few blocks to central park. Typical New York street parking (aka nonexistent!) But garages everywhere! Also easy to get on the FDR freeway.\r\n\r\nIn short, everything as listed (or above and beyond!).\r\n\r\nThanks Sara!"},{"_id":"43108291","date":{"$date":"2015-08-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4523435","reviewer_id":"29400968","reviewer_name":"Andrea","comments":"Our stay was excellent!

Ustensiles et certains aliments tels que le café était déjà disponible par notre hôte. Les instructions rédigées sous forme d'un dossier , très détaillés comprenant l'ensemble des fonctions et rangements de la maison , ainsi que les restaurants et commerces à proximité. Elle met également à disponibilité une carte des réseaux de transport. Tout au long du séjour elle resta disponible par tous les moyens de communications et à la moindre question .\r\nEn ce qui concerne le quartier , calme et bien fréquenté , avec la présence de plusieurs restaurants et boutiques pour faire ses courses . L'arrêt de bus est à moins de 100m , tandis et le métro à moins de 10mn de marche , ce qui pour une ville grande comme New York relativement proche . Vous avez également accès en 15mn à Central-Park.\r\nEn résumé Sara fût une \" excellente \" hôte à notre égard. Son appartement est un mix de charme , de tranquillité et de vie purement New-yorkaise. C'est la location parfaite pour un premier séjour dans la ville qui ne dort jamais .

The description is accurate, nothing we thought the place needed. Some tips for other travelers, but mostly for people who are not used to walking. This is on the 4th floor and to get where most will be going is up a gradual hill. We had no problem with this but after a few days you start wondering if that one thing in your car is really worth it. Our friends we met up with were tired of walking everywhere, but that is what we do when we are in the city. The neighborhood is nice. Anything you really need is within a 10 minute walk if not right around the corner. We found a great french pizza place, Vietnamese, diner and papya king within a short distance. On a personal note, it is close enough to central park that if you are a runner, by the time you get to the park, your legs are loose and ready to go. I loved that the park had a dirt path around it. As a trail runner, this was the surprise of the trip. Liz's description of the area is that It's a nice neighborhood that you could get lost in for days and not experience it all. The only thing that will make us look elsewhere next time in the city would be if we are going to be centrally located in a different area. One more thing I forgot to mention was that this was my 1st experience driving into the city. Since her place is far enough away from downtown, you can go over the Washington bridge and sneak into the FDR highway and not have to deal with as much traffic."},{"_id":"49726523","date":{"$date":"2015-10-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4523435","reviewer_id":"45161438","reviewer_name":"Victoria","comments":"Sara was a fantastic host!

There was a large, high-def TV with many cable channels, and the capability of easy Net-Flix streaming.\r\n\r\nThe location was excellent, with many nearby restaurants.   It was an easy walk to Central Park and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.   It was within half a block of the 2nd Avenue bus line (M-15), which is an easy way to get downtown and to lower Manhattan.   Some of our most fun times were spent riding the bus.  It’s a great way to meet native New Yorkers.\r\n\r\nSara was accommodating, readily available, and easy to work with.  We liked her a lot.

Close enough to the main streets leading downtown, yet just far enough that it was quite when retreating to rest. The studio was extremely comfortable w/an efficient use of space. My 21 yr old daughter and I stayed for the weekend to enjoy the Holiday Festivities.. albeit a bit too much the nite before we were scheduled to leave. We awoke late, missed our flight, and ended up having to make a mad dash out the door,  to catch our new flight - leaving the apt disorderly and not at all how we'd envisioned leaving our hostess' home! Sara, however, handled this as a true professional. She was polite and accepting of our plight and receiving of my apologies. Bless you, Sara! \r\n\r\nShe left a thoughtful note offering recommendations of a nice variety of excellent nearby restaurants and instructions for use of the apt. (like her WiFi network/password!) She had fresh linens and EXCELLENT handsoaps set out for our use; compatible to a nice hotel, actually. Full service kitchen gave us the freedom to bring back bottled water and restaurant leftovers to eat the next day. The home is easily comfortable for two adults.. perhaps even 3 if there is a couple who doesn't mind sleeping together in the bed.. I think it was a full size mattress. My daughter said the couch was very comfy too! \r\n\r\nThe only thing that caught me by surprise were the stairs.. this was my 1st trip to NYC .. so I guess I was assuming there'd be an elevator. So, if you bring heavy luggage, or you're not in the best health.. you may have some challenges getting up all the stairs = 4 flights @ 18 steps each flight. You certainly get your workout! The building was very quite and hallway passerbys were friendly. Her unit is top floor so nobody above you. \r\n\r\nSara has a great design aesthetic; her home was very interesting... the only recommendation I'd have is to add to your 'welcome sheet' a short bio about you! My daughter and I found ourselves wondering .. what line of work is she in, what is her life like, where does she stay when she's renting out her home, what does she do for fun in this amazing city????? We may be more curious than most.. but when temporarily living in someone's home.. we couldn't help but wonder more about SARA! From her choice of books (including the way she color coordinated them-LOVE IT!!!!), perfumes, and organizational style.. she's definitely someone I'd likely be good friends with - and of course I LOVE her name, lol. \r\n\r\nYou won't be sorry if you stay here.. it's a wise choice and perfect location.

Right off of 2nd ave so there were so many restaurants, delis, and bar options. Just 4 short blocks to the 86th street subway stations. \n\nThe apartment itself was very clean and neat. I appreciated the minimalist style. I had everything I needed for my weekend stay: a comfy bed and sofa, clean bathroom with lots of hot water, and good heat for the cold winter nights. \n\nThe only thing I think should be added to the post is that this is a 4th floor walk-up. Meaning that there is no elevator and 4 pretty steep flights of stairs. They were no problem for me but I could see how some guests would find this problematic. \n\nTry the Midnight Express for yummy NYC style diner food. Visit the Drunken Monkey for some great Indian food. If you’re in the mood for quick and cheap but extremely delicious breakfast sandwiches- go to the Deli on 2nd ave."},{"_id":"238676585","date":{"$date":"2018-02-26T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4523435","reviewer_id":"173884660","reviewer_name":"Mitsy","comments":"Sara's place was awesome (just like the pictures).

Its a very convenient neighbourhood, however its on a quiet street and close to cafés and restaurants.  The apartment is located an easy walk to the neighbourhoods of Newtown, Redfern and Chinatown and walkable (2.5km) to Darling Harbour. For groceries, I recommend going to the SPAR supermarket at Redfern station.  This old Sydney neighbourhood is predominately made up of lovely old terraces but there are also many green spaces nearby.  There is a cafe is located just across the street, and there is a quiet boutique pub just next to it. There's also an organic tea shop just down the street too. Guests should try: * Going to the Harbour, I can suggest going for a walk across the bridge! You can also walk up a Harbour Bridge pylon (The South east one) for $13, or for something really special, book a bridgeclimb. Make sure you see the Opera House, and the entry to the Botannical Gardens is just behind it. *","notes":"You can use the space as you please however to comfortably accommodate 4 people, 2 would sleep upstairs and 2 downstairs in the living space on a convertible queen sized chaise sofa bed (Frieheiten Ikea sofa). The apartment is 64sqm in total including balconies. * The apartment has 2 toilets (one upstairs and one downstairs in the laundry), but just one shower (at the upstairs bedroom).  * I have a hairdryer, a rice cooker and even a baby cot! * Full kitchen use is included. Milk is provided and some sauces, butter etc. Note you are completely welcome to consume any food you find in the apartment. Tea and coffee is provided. * The complex has lots of fire extinguishers should you need them. * An early check in/late check out maybe available. Let me know in advance if you would like this option and I will check if it's possible for you. An extremely early checkin may attract an extra night's accommodation charge since it makes it difficult to rent the apartment out for the night before.","transit":"For your convenience I provide Opal cards (transport cards) for your use while in Sydney. If you use them I just ask that you top the cards up again to a balance similar to how you found them before you depart from Sydney.  The best way to from the airport to the apartment is to take a taxi. You are likely to get change back from $30. It's also just a 4 minute walk to Redfern station (which is 1 stop from Central), and you can be almost anywhere in the Sydney region pretty quickly.  You need to change trains at Central though. It should only take ~15 minutes and cost just under $30 for a taxi. (To go back to the airport I suggest hailing a taxi from the other side of Cleveland St outside the convenience store, taxis come very regularly.) There is a car share (GoGet) car 20 metres down the street, a bicycle hire cafe across the street and (some) buses nearby on Cleveland St.  And... the apartment has a car space too. :) If you are very keen, you can walk the whole distance through the c","access":"Easy check in procedure - if you want to arrive 11pm?

She went the extra mile to make sure I would locate and enter the apartment easily, that I would have amenities ready for me before I even set foot in the country. She showed genuine care and concern, which is at times uncommon even among friends. Her apartment was spotless, thoughtfully designed and easy to get to from the airport (using airport-hotel shuttle buses, stop at Y Hotel Sydney South). It is minutes from cafes and the train station. It has a gorgeously open balcony and generous sunlight during the day. As it is very well insulated, I imagine stays during winter would be comfortable as well. The only guests who should reconsider this apartment are those who are unable to use staircase, as the bedroom is a stairway-up from the living area. Linda is an excellent host with an amazing apartment and if I were more selfish, I would not have spoken too highly of it, so that I can have it more to myself! :)"},{"_id":"24122600","date":{"$date":"2014-12-20T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4532525","reviewer_id":"9141398","reviewer_name":"Alec","comments":"Had a great time at Linda's apartment.

There's not much in the way of restaurants nearby but pretty much every train in Sydeny seems to stop at Redfern which is only 4mins walk away so it was easy to get around. Bring your ear plugs as the road behind can be noisy with the windows open.

Linda provided us with a cot for him to use (for free) which was terrific. We had some queries and Linda got back to us immediately with answers to our questions. We liked the \"manual\" she left for the Redfern area which highlighted activities we might otherwise not have done like visiting the local weekend market.\r\n\r\nThe Redfern neighbourhood is a bit of a hipsters area. There's a good (bike) coffee shop opposite and we had a ridiculously good Sunday lunch at the pub next door. The very well connected underground station is a short walk away.

She gave clear instructions to pick up the key, use the wifi and left maps with advice on places to visit. The location was perfect for us; near family and the railway station.  We hired bikes from over the road ($20 for half day) and cycled to Balmain. Great cycling along the river but busy roads. You can walk to the city centre- we walked offroad through parks to Darling Harbour and the botanical gardens. Comfy big bed with good quality bedding and loads of hot water. Everything else was a bonus. Glad there was a heater as our first evenings were chilly and a television to watch the Olympics. The wifi was welcome. The Eveleigh Hotel opposite had good meals but we mainly shopped at Coles in Broadway and Spar opposite the station. We thought of hiring a car so the car parking space was a plus but actually travelled everywhere by the excellent public transport. The Opal app was really helpful; we already had Opal cards. It's a modern block that looks a little prison-like compared to the cute houses in the rest of the street but is big enough and well-equipped. \r\nThere's a big sofa which converts into a big sofa bed. The upstairs bedroom has no door, it's a railing but a good size and watching tv on low downstairs was ok and didn't disturb the sleeper.

We really enjoyed how close the property was to the train station and the downtown areas of Sydney, while at the same time the neighborhood was still very peaceful and quiet.  Providing Opal cards (for the city transportation) was a real plus.  And since we are runners, having a washer and dryer for laundry, and not needing to take stinky clothes back home was lovely.

Linda was an excellent host. The unit was very clean, and everything you can think of was provided (paper towels, laundry soap, shampoo, shower gel, dish soap, even sunscreen). The best thing was that the kitchen was FULLY stocked and the washer/dryer were super convenient. Having the OPAL cards ready to go made it really easy. Be sure to read up on how to use them and top them off as the least you could do online is $40 AU per adult card, and it took up to an hour to be available. Top-offs can also be done at the station in lesser denominations. Bed was comfy, plenty of clean sheets and towels were available. One ice tray was provided for ice, which was plenty for us. Fans were plenty to keep cool in summer as long as you leave doors and windows open. Suggest taking Uber to and from the airport as most economical method, but leave plenty of time to travel; though only 5 miles from the airport it took over 30 minutes to drive. The only drawback to us was that there was very little counter space in the bathroom, but we adapted to that easily. We loved staying there and will happily go back should we ever find ourselves in Sydney again.

It is very close to down town, so you can walk everywhere, it is also very close to the beach, I personally liked the beach more than Waikiki, only because you aren't towel to towel. This part of the island does get a little bit cloudier but hop in the car or bus and you can get to another beach that is clear and sunny in a couple of minutes.

Additionally, he has an outdoor shower \u0026 a spigot to ensure you wash all the sand off before entering the cottage. \n\nWe had a huge king size bed upstairs with closet space, hangers \u0026 a nice little nook area.

The bathroom and shower were very nice and numerous good towels etc were provided. The sitting area has a comfy couch and although no cable, we had access to Netflix for the rainy evenings. The loft area is bright and so nice to sit looking out from the REALLY comfortable king bed. There's a closet to hang clothes and a set of drawers and a place to put folded clothes. There were good boogie boards and chairs, beach mats and towels for our use. Christian is very pleasant and responded quickly to any communications and was quick to provide a needed beach umbrella as soon as he could. The location is off a lane on a neighborhood residential street and is very quiet and private.

It was a great position for access to Turtle Bay beach and other surrounding beaches without the expense of the hotel. There was snorkelling gear, beach chairs, boogie boards and beach mats available for us to use. The towels were plentiful and we had pretty much everything that we needed for the kitchen. It was generally clean with a very modern kitchen and great big fridge.The bathroom and bedroom were a little dated but fine. Check in time was 4 pm and unfortunately there didn't appear to be any flexibility with that. The traffic was pretty heavy driving up the coast road from Wikiki and of course we wanted to take advantage of stopping along the way as well as buying food supplies for our stay. Therefore we arrived at 6pm. There is security gate and when we called the number, no one answered. We called our host, but we were not able to contact anyone. We were worried as to how to get in for quite sometime. Eventually we worked out another way. Our host was very apologetic. But it was cause for concern. The accommodation was clean. Although not a huge problem, we did run out of hot water as the tanks are quite small. So be mindful of using the dishwasher when you need a shower. The beds were not as comfortable as I would have liked, but everyone has different requirements.

The arrival instructions are lengthy and could use an update as certain things are not made very clear. For example, it says there are designated smoking areas, yet all around the property it says no smoking. Also, the BBQs require charcoal and that should be made known. We also were led to believe that while staying at Kuilima Estates you had access to Turtle Bay Resort pools. That is absolutely not true, if you want access to a hot tub don't rent this condo. The ad states the condo sleeps 4, however when we arrived there was only one fitted sheet, no pillowcases or top sheets for the pull out bed or for the futon. Communication with Maisa was quick and easy so we did receive sheets but unfortunately it was 3 days into our stay. The condo above and next door are being renovated so we were woken up to construction sounds multiple mornings. The lady that lives next door is rude and disregards the quiet time hours and asked us to shut our door at 8pm on a Friday night (don't even bother staying if you have loud kids). There were some annoying things about this place, but overall it was a nice condo and our issues were independent of the condo itself.

There was a Foodland supermarket close to the condo, so you can take advantage of the beautiful kitchen and not have to always eat out.

The kitchen is thoroughly equipped with quality appliances. Neighbouring condos were almost entirely quiet during my stay. The north shore location is ideal for beaches and snorkelling/diving during summer months, being a 15 minute drive to Shark's Cove, Three Tables, etc., to the west, or a similar distance to any number of vast, uncrowded beaches along the east coast.\n\nTip 1: Be sure to hang the provided parking permit on your rear view mirror - I missed this one evening and got an angry notice from estate security warning that my vehicle would soon be towed.\n\nTip 2: If you're driving to/from Honolulu, consider taking Kamehameha Highway (aka Route 83) up the *east* coast instead of the slightly shorter direct route across the centre of the island. Kamehameha Highway is absolutely stunning on a sunny day, with towering green mountains to one side, and the sparkling ocean so close on the other side that breaking waves will splash against your car tyres."},{"_id":"197541908","date":{"$date":"2017-09-25T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4556650","reviewer_id":"82569667","reviewer_name":"Wendy","comments":"We had a wonderful trip.

He kindly helped us with our bags and was very communicative, warm and inviting from the outset. When we entered the apartment, we were blown away. It's much bigger in person and, whilst I'll simply be repeating other reviews, the views are just breathtaking. We actually opted to sit and sip drinks looking out over going to rooftop bars as the views were far, far better. Peter was also kind enough to point us in the direction of main attractions, many of which were within walking distance. We also loved the thoughtful touches (slippers and soaps) which added some luxury.\n\nDuring the stay, the water was shut off in the building for repairs which was completely out of Peter's control. He quickly responded when we inform him and the issue was swiftly resolved after his advice to talk to reception. It was no issue at all and it shows Peter's level of professionalism. \n\nIt's clear that not only does Peter take great pride in his home, he cares about his guests and goes above and beyond to make sure they're comfortable. He is a true super host and we very much hope that we can stay at his place in the not so distance future. Peter - thank you so much for your amazing hospitality.

Also, the curtains are almost transparent, so the light woke me up early every morning (this may be only my problem, I admit).\r\n"},{"_id":"32376444","date":{"$date":"2015-05-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4573398","reviewer_id":"31762317","reviewer_name":"Sookyeong","comments":"탁심에 위치한 숙소라 위치 좋고 가격 저렴하고 좋았어요\n길을 모르면 처음에 찾아가기는 좀 어려울수도 있는데\n주소를 정확히 알고 지도 보면 쉬워요\n공항가는 버스 타기도 좋고 밤늦게도 북적이는 동네라 좋았어요\n집은 작지만 편하게 쓸 수 있게 해주었고 별다른 불편함없이 잘 지냈어요\n저렴하게 탁심에서 묵고 싶은 분들에게 추천해요!\n"},{"_id":"32620725","date":{"$date":"2015-05-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4573398","reviewer_id":"11365698","reviewer_name":"Florence","comments":"C'est une chambre bien située, à proximité de la place taksim.\r\nPropre, calme et agréable.\r\nFaisal était absent mais son ami m'accueilli très amicalement."},{"_id":"32877804","date":{"$date":"2015-05-23T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4573398","reviewer_id":"2910430","reviewer_name":"Enghui + Lauren","comments":"Faisal and Ghassan were fantastic hosts.

Today we left apartments we booked three days earlier that we planned. And we’d like to have our money back for the 3 cancelled days.\n\nUnluckily, we also were not satisfied with the service at all and our host didn’t help us. \n\nFirst, the host Faisal who is registered on Airbnb, told in the profile he lives in USA and his cousin Ahmet would meet the guests. That was okay, but the person we communicate with was nor Faisal nor Ahmet, it was Ghassan, which as Faisal said was his friend.\n\nWhen we got in and spent a night in the apartment, we realized Ghasan was living here, and not only visiting house at mornings and evenings, as it was said in the description of the room. \n\nHe also used to invite friends in the apartment who supposedly were not guests (because they were sitting in the guestroom for hours and chatting with Ghasan and then disappeared). So we didn’t feel completely safe.\n\nWe also did not know that smoking of hookah is allowed in the house. We both are non-smokers, so it’s essential for us. We were surprised this essential information wasn’t mentioned in the description of the apartment.\n\nAnd today we found someone’s dirty socks on the vacuum cleaner in the kitchen. This was the final issue, and also the absence of water in the area, which for sure was not the responsibility of our host. But he was not helpful enough and was already gone so we couldn’t even talk to him about the mess. He left us alone.\n\nWhen we wrote about all those problems to our host Faisal, he just said he see no problem in it. He also wrote that Ghassan told him about our fight with another guests  - that was totally not truth and a little bit shocking. We were very sad to hear that.

Скорость и сигнал интернета отличный. Добраться куда-либо не составляет труда, если заранее запланировать маршрут ( (Hidden by Airbnb) maps в помощь:)). За неделю не заметила какого-либо недостатка или  неудобства в проживании. Шума с улиц и призывов на намаз из мечетей не слышно совсем. Можно готовить, магазинов рядом много.

My block, specifically, is a living reminder of the East Village's punk-rock past. Significant moments in counterculture history happened all along the street: Abbie Hoffman invented the Yippies at No. 30 in 1967; Andy Warhol, the Velvet Underground, and Jimi Hendrix performed at now-gone experimental nightclub Electric Circus, before it closed in 1971; and gallery 51X backed eighties-era graffiti artists like Keith Haring and Basquiat. Today, the street's grasp on culture lies mostly within its diverse restaurants (frankfurters at Crif Dogs, Israeli cuisine at Hummus Place) and storefronts.

She was away the weekend we stayed at her place but  the place had a warm feeling (good sunlight and visual space) for a studio apartment sized space. Apartment was clean and located in the heart of East Village. Despite being on a noisy street, the apartment faces the back so it was very quiet as advertised.\r\n\r\nThe apartment allows easy access all the bars, restaurants, cafes in both the east and west village area. Also, during the weekend, I found free parking west of 5th Ave. The IRT east side subway is just couple of blocks away. It was very easy to get to the Upper west side as well as getting to other parts of Manhattan.\r\n\r\nDefinitely a good weekend excursion place to stay if you are looking to do alot of stuff in the city rather than spending alot of time in the apartment."},{"_id":"3987648","date":{"$date":"2013-04-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"457829","reviewer_id":"1526645","reviewer_name":"Ueli","comments":"We stayed at Mayra's place and had a great time.

Loads of bars/restaurants really close by, great access to public transport and, if you are happy to, easy walking distance to a lot of areas. Mayra's housemate was LOVELY...friendly, helpful and really accommodating.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately Mayra had not told him we were staying, so we were lucky he was in when we arrived as the friend who was supposed to let us in was not there. Mayra had another friend who had been staying in the room, so when we arrived her stuff was still in the room. Very confusing! Eventually the friend arrived with the keys, but we were left to change the bed ourselves, the room was a little dirty and it was initially pretty uncomfortable as her roommate did not know we were coming and apparently other bookings had been made without him knowing. Also we were told he would be travelling a lot, he was often away most of the time and we would basically have the apartment to ourselves...not true.\r\n\r\nLuckily he was great, made us feel welcome and at home and we had a fantastic stay in New York despite an interesting start. We were out and about a lot so only used the room for sleeping so it was all good; as mentioned, great location...but it felt like the host had not really been that honest with us about the set up before our arrival."},{"_id":"8002477","date":{"$date":"2013-10-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"457829","reviewer_id":"4654593","reviewer_name":"Maaike","comments":"Mayra's place is a very good spot to visit NYC from.

Lovely, very clean little apartment - only comment would be that the bed is a climb-up and separated from the communal kitchen by a curtain so probably not ideal for older people or a couple! Fine for us though (two friends). Neighborhood is wonderful for getting around Manhattan and Williamsburg, but the street is a bit rough - lots of tattoo places and take out joints - and the building corridors smell and are dirty... fine once you get inside apartment but again might not suit older people!

The flat was in a fab location, but unfortunately the state of the flat wasn't very great at all. It was very run down, water flooding from the shower, there were no pots to cook and no hob so you better eat out which for us meant spending more money than originally intended. We did not get the room on the picture but instead a very simple room with 1 bed, 1 sofa, 1 cupboard. Not cosy or personal in any way and our main roommates were not the one mentioned (who had left when we arrived although he was still introduced to us via email) but 2 other Airbnber's and several pidgeons constantly sitting and screaming outside of the window.  If you only intend to be here for the hours you sleep it's OK.

For what it offers, it's significantly over priced. \r\n\r\nThe long- This was my first time trying AirBnB and I feel terrible to have dragged my family along for the experience.  The front entrance smelled of piss and the hallway inside wasn't any better.  At the base of the steps inside is where the building's trash is thrown, it seems, but rather than cans of trash, it was a pile of garbage overflowing into the hallway.   Then came trouble with the apartment door/lock.  My family tried at it for 10-15 minutes before we decided to call Mayra because it was definitely a problem with the door, not us.  Luckily, Mayra was readily accessible by phone, but even her detailed directions couldn't help us in.  She offered to come by to open the apartment door, which was nice, but now we were left waiting in the dirty narrow halls for 40 minutes.  It was about 8:30pm when we called by the way...  everything thus far was very disheartening, especially after a long and tiring day of exploring New York.  During our 40 minute wait, we found that we were in the company of 4 rats scurrying back and forth through the pile of trash.  When Mayra arrived, she too admitted it was normally difficult to open the door..  It just so happened that the door was being extra difficult with us.  Hopefully, this is not a problem with future AirBnBers.  Once inside, we did not feel anymore comfortable- it was not what the pictures showed at all!  I've stayed in many hostels over the years and I would equate the state of this apartment to the most decrepit, poorly kept hostel I've ever stayed in.  We avoided using anything in the house as none of it felt clean, i.e. the kitchen, the bathroom, and shower especially.  And although the beds were made, the sheets didn't feel clean either.  To end our night, we took the recommendation of leaving the windows open for a nice breeze, but instead we were swarmed by mosquitoes throughout the night.  We were so thankful we only booked for one night!  Couldn't have gotten out any faster the next morning.\r\n\r\nI realize the state of the building and some other factors are out of Mayra's control, but these are things I wish I knew before we stayed.  \r\n\r\nThe price we paid was $250/night.  For anyone looking to stay in New York, I would like to say that you can find much better.  Our 3 days prior, in a very nice hotel, and 4 days after, in another apartment through AirBnB, were both were amazing and cheaper!\r\n\r\nFor more about the apartment, I recommend reviews left by Kellea (same apt, other listing) and Jeff \u0026 Faith.  Their reviews were very accurate regarding my experience.\r\n\r\nLastly, this review is is no way speaking of Mayra.  She was an extremely nice host, unfortunately, her apartment happened to be the complete opposite."},{"_id":"54144917","date":{"$date":"2015-11-16T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"457829","reviewer_id":"8034880","reviewer_name":"James","comments":"Everything about this place was awesome.

So after going out I bring friends of my over they don't stay the night. She send me an email saying she know it's not in her house rules but not to bring people over I said sorry.  obviously Her friends said something. That night her friends bring someone over and they are loud and don't sleep until 3am drinking beers btw the room we have is off the kitchen and has a window into the kitchen. They were speaking Spanish. Not knowing that I spoke Spanish. They were being very rude and ended up staying two night they also woke up at 6am to leave honestly if I knew it was going to be like this I would of paid for a hotel instead.

Il se trouve au 4ème étage, et là encore ça pourrait paraitre haut mais nous avons réussi avec 2 bébés et 2 poussettes alors si on peut, tout le monde peut!! \r\nJe vais recommender cet appart à ma famille et mes amis, je pense que ça veut tout dire!! :-)"},{"_id":"75000268","date":{"$date":"2016-05-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"457829","reviewer_id":"27749613","reviewer_name":"Jessica","comments":"Lorena's apartment is at a great location, and it is a cute apartment.

There was also a giant cockroach that ran across the floor.

The apartment is near several useful trains to get around the city, and there are lots of great affordable eateries immediately nearby.\r\n\r\nA couple of things to note: It is a fourth floor walk up in the European style of numbering in that the ground floor is not the first floor.  This was fine for me, but might be a deal breaker for some.  The bathroom was small but not inconvenient.  As a larger individual I would have preferred more room.  Those are about the only things that I could call negatives.\r\n\r\nLorena, the host, was excellent.  She was very communicative and prompt with answers to questions.

The building is in poor shape. Very dirty.  The apartment itself was clean. I recommend that you request a picture of the bathroom before booking. If I had seen the bathroom, I would have never booked.  It is very small. The shower knobs, when turned, feel like they will fall off. The angle of the showerhead makes the water go to the bathroom floor.  The sink is so small that we had to wash our faces in kitchen sink. Just some advice.

There are a lot of good restaurants and bars opening till midnight around the neighborhood so dining is very convenient. There are 2 rooms in the apartment; the spacious main room is at the back side of the apartment so is quiet at night; we didn't use the other one which is at the street side so couldn't tell if it's quiet enough at night but we definitely could hear the voice from street at day time. The floor, kitchen and the sofa are not very clean but the condition is acceptable. The bathroom is very tiny and the showering water quite easily floods out of the shower area so the bathroom mat was is wet. The apartment is on 4F without elevator, and the stairs space is quite narrow so it's a bit dizzy after climbing for 4 floors. The public area of the building is quite dirty. We didn't meet the host in person but she was easily to reach and communicate. In terms of cost/performance of the apartment, we think it's a little bit expensive considering the size and condition of the apartment but I guess that's what it takes to stay in a such a good area in New York."},{"_id":"155194584","date":{"$date":"2017-05-27T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"457829","reviewer_id":"115285146","reviewer_name":"Haochuan","comments":"公寓位于曼哈顿东村,前往各旅游景点方便,房东热情,及时给我们提供各种交通出行信息,纽约的房屋都是有百年历史的老房子,公寓周边超市､酒吧､各类餐馆很多,非常方便,总之,这是一次愉快的体验,谢谢房东!"},{"_id":"155738062","date":{"$date":"2017-05-28T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"457829","reviewer_id":"3507165","reviewer_name":"Gary","comments":"Cool location.

There was no designated local person for us to contact in case we had issues. All other times when we've stayed at airbnb if the owner was not in town, they've always had a local person there to meet us or a contact # of a local person for us to contact if we needed anything. \n\nLorena had gotten new furniture after we had booked with her. The furniture was nice, but the new arrangement resulted in one less bed. When we booked we were specifically needing 3 bed apartments, which was this apartment originally. But we ended up with only 2 beds,  That was a bit disappointing. \n\nFinally, when we arrived a man approached us wanting us to tell him exactly what apartment unit we were staying in. Being a complete stranger to us and on the street, we wouldn't tell him. The conversation got a little confrontational and he proceeded to tell us it was illegal to rent out airbnb and that he was the superintendent. Still with no id, we did not tell him where we were staying. I did contact Lorena who got back with me the next morning, due to time differences, and was able to verify the man was the superintendent but also verified it was perfectly legal for her to rent out through airbnb. \nIt was just an odd encounter that started our stay feeling a little uneasy. I was glad Lorena was able to verify who he was."},{"_id":"221762643","date":{"$date":"2017-12-27T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"457829","reviewer_id":"69192150","reviewer_name":"Brian","comments":"As advertised, great place in a great part of town!

The things I didn’t expect and threw me off:\n\nWe were getting there a bit sooner on our checkin day and I asked her the night before if I can drop my luggages 1-2 hours sooner and she said since no one booked the place that night I can check in as early in the morning so we took our heavy luggages there under the rain and the access code she gave me wasn’t working because she forgot to grant me early access and she didn’t answer any of my calls or texts until 6 hours after my check in!! Yes she didn’t have to do make me a favor but when your host tells you something you want to count on them! So we ended up wandering around under the rain for 2 hours in Manhattan with our heavy luggages! Anyways after I got the key I had to climb four floors to get to the apt (if you come to this place don’t bring anything more than a backpack) and the apartment looked much much smaller than the photos. But the worst part of my stay was sleeping in the bed. The pillow and the blankets were smelling musty! So we had to wear our jackets and use our towels to sleep through the night!

Maybe one of the most beautiful places on the whole island! It's very close to great local restaurants and stores, as well as  swimming areas like (one of my favorite snorkeling spots of the trip) Two-Step Beach. It's also just very comfortable and relaxing. You can literally stay at the house all day and be happy. Michael was always quick to respond to any questions I had, and his on-site assistant Chuck was funny, kind, and wonderfully generous with his time and knowledge of the island. My wife and I had an amazing stay here and we'd definitely come back a million more times if we could."},{"_id":"109112480","date":{"$date":"2016-10-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4580916","reviewer_id":"82983642","reviewer_name":"Mike","comments":"Tara Cottage is a gem!  Michael the host, is very friendly and welcoming.\r\nWe loved the stunning, peaceful location (about 30 minutes drive from Kona airport) with a view of the ocean and the beautiful, well kept gardens.  Everything is thought of, including some complimentary local produce, flower arrangement, books, cds, beach towels \u0026 chairs, cool box, snorkelling equipment etc.  The kitchen has a selection of condiments, cleaning and washing products and is very well equipped.  Two of the best snorkelling areas are very close by and each morning the dolphins come into the bay, which added to a very special experience.  It was wonderful to sit in the garden drinking fresh coffee which had been grown in the garden!  Great solar powered outdoor shower too! This place is so good, we didn't want to leave!

From the cottage you look across lawns above the coffe plantation  down the hill and out across the bay to the captain cook monument without seeing any signs of habitation -very quiet except for the occasional wild turkey or rooster. Set at about 1000 foot elevation the temperature is perfect and great to come home to when the beaches get too hot or humid. The grounds are immaculate as is the decoration of the cottage. We feel we were very lucky to find such a place for a quiet and peaceful vacation.

He was very welcoming, always available to answer questions and knowledgable about local happenings and history. We stayed for two weeks and could not have been happier. Each day we left to explore the island hiking, swimming, snorkeling, coffee tasting, sightseeing, and returning to Tara was like coming home. Quiet and relaxing, surrounded by a beautiful garden filled with birds and a gorgeous ocean view from the lanai, we wanted for nothing! The cottage was well equipped from kitchen to laundry to water toys and a wonderful outdoor shower. Tara is close to the some of the islands best snorkeling, a great local beach and grocery store. An idyllic place to stay for couples. Michaels listing of Tara was completely accurate and the neighborhood was ideal. If we return to the Big Island we will stay here again!

As so many have said, it's a beautifully-appointed cottage with many nice touches, located on a breathtakingly gorgeous property! It had everything we needed and was very comfortable and welcoming. The outdoor shower was a treat and made it feel like a spa. The fresh fruit and baked goodies we received upon arrival were most welcome and we adored the Tara Coffee. We only wish we had brought more home with us! The view of the ocean and bay in the distance was nice to gaze out on from the kitchen table and lanai. And we really appreciated how quiet Tara Cottage was! It felt private, which we really liked. The coqui frog-song at night was a real highlight for us as was the birdsong in the morning. All in all, it was the perfect location for exploring South Kona and for enjoying amazing snorkeling at Two Step (we went every day, sometimes twice) and getting to know the area. Five nights is simply not enough! We regret not taking the time to rent a kayak at Kealakelua Bay, so we need to come back for that! Michael was very gracious as was Gloria, the housekeeper. We lacked for nothing (except for ripe mangoes and white pineapples, because they weren't in season yet!). I don't think we could've found a more perfect place.

Michael has put so much thought and love into every square inch of the cottage and surrounding acreage. This was our first time visiting the Big Island, but we spent just as much time lounging in the cottage, relaxing on the deck, taking in the spectacular views and going for walks in the surrounding neighborhood as we did sightseeing. It was definitely home away from home. Being upnin the mountains away from busy downtown Kona was perfect! Far enough away, yet a 15 minutes drive to downtown Kona. We will definitely be back!

And what can I say? It was great! Being located near to Plaza Catalunya and La Rambla, the apartment is very central and perfect to go everythere you want to - by feet and metro. If you want to visit Parc Güell for example, you can jump directly on the metro line L3 which leads there. \n\nTogether with us were two other people in the apartment, but that wasn't a problem at all. The room was a two-bed room with a small balcony facing the street side with a nice view on the wild La Rambla. \n\nWe only got to know Paolo who did the check-in and check-out, always having an open ear for all the questions coming to your mind. Because our flight home was not before the evening, he offered to leave the luggage in the apartment even after the check-out and come back later to get it. So as you can see, a very kind and attentive guy. Thanks again Paolo :-))\n\nLike mentioned also in other reviews before: Being located on La Rambla with a lot of bars, it can get a little noisy outside during the night. So I definitly recommend to bring some earplugs with you - just in case you can't fall asleep. Now in winter it was ok, but I don't know how it will be in summer. Coming to warmth and cold: The room also contains a heating and a ventilator thus you will be prepared for summer and winter.\n\nAll in all: There's everything you need for a small, but comfortable stay.\n"},{"_id":"129052709","date":{"$date":"2017-01-29T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4586762","reviewer_id":"81985009","reviewer_name":"Ang","comments":"We only ended up meeting Tony's roommate Paolo, but everything was great!

The bed was comfortable and the room temperature was good. \n\nHouse had all the amenities you might want, laundry, cookery, etc. \n\nOnly downsides I can think of are 1. during the hot summer days there is no air conditioner, but there is a powerful ceiling fan that kept the room at a pleasing temp. And 2. There was a big cockroach that flew in through the open window one night, but that's on us for leaving the window open. \n\nHighly recommended place - easy walking distance to any Bondi area, or a smooth bus ride anywhere else.

They left some hints and suggestions of what to do in the room with contact details and everything we needed to know about the area, where to get public transport, eat and go out. They even lent us beach towels. Lee lent me her straightener. WiFi too. Bathroom was super clean with a great shower. They got us a cab when an uber let us down. It was like being at home abroad. Very casual down to earth couple. In an ideal location near Bondi Beach. Just a 5 min walk but yet away from the hustle \u0026 bustle of the parade opposite beach.

Even though it is so close to the nightlife it's on a quiet road so getting a good nights sleep was easy. We had Xmas dinner with their family which was incredible generous. You have to do the walk from bondi beach along the coast to Coogee as it's stunning!! \n\nOverall couldn't fault anything about our stay and if we ever need somewhere to stay near bondi in future I will be coming straight back here. \n\nThanks again for an amazing few days. \n\nPatrick and Elle x"},{"_id":"224951630","date":{"$date":"2018-01-04T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4589874","reviewer_id":"150734645","reviewer_name":"Mike","comments":"Room and bathroom were nice the common areas outside looked tired compared to photos could of been due to the weather as there was some rain when we arrived.

We were in the middle of everything--food places, shops, malls, MTR, etc. You can reach everything by foot. You don't even have to leave that far. The space was just as expected on the picture, small but it has everything you ned. It is especially perfect for those who are looking for a place to crash after a whole day trip. We also liked the feel of the bed and the linens since they were all very comfortable. Overall a great trip.

Craig is a great host and offered us enough privacy. The lawn outside is pretty and offers great view of the beach.  Very close to grocery stores and only miles from Shark Cove, Haleiwa etc. \r\n\r\nHaving said that, I wouldn't recommend this place for couples. They have basically converted the 3rd part of a 3 car garage space to make this studio which seemed less than 200 sq ft. and the toilet is inside the studio with no separate door. Me and my wife had to take turns to hang outside anytime either of us needed to use the toilet.

Waking up every morning to walk out onto the beautiful beach and watch pipeline from the front steps and then watching the sunsets from the same spot is a massive treat! Was spoilt with this location on the north shore (as long as you have a car). Such a chilled out location, would recommend to anyone wanting some time away from the hustle and bustle and planning to spend most of their time outside ! Cosy self contained unit and has everything available for cooking meals. Great property !

Once our flight had been delayed he help us uncomplicated. Furthermore Craig and his family informed us quickly when a seal was sleeping on the beach. We had our own private area and could use Craig's washer and dryer.\n\nIf you would plan an experience trip zu Hawaii it's really nice place for sleep. If we wake up it was a short step to the beautiful beach and every time you could have a awesome view during the breakfast and you could see the sunset in the evening.\n\nYou should know that's the room is a little bit smaller that it seems on the fotos. It was really warm in the room and the AC was to loud for us. If you would sleep with open window you could hear the Highway. The hot outdoor shower is really nice and cozy. The neighbors from the vacation house on the right could see you from the balcony.\n\nFor us that facts didn't matter, we only need a bed after sunset and we enjoyed the awesome view and the greatful and helpful host family. \n\nThank you, Craig!"},{"_id":"51605263","date":{"$date":"2015-10-22T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4642565","reviewer_id":"16759674","reviewer_name":"Madeleine","comments":"Amazing location - Pipeline is a few steps from the studio door.

It is on a beautiful beach where you can walk right down to the water on a stone path. Would recommend having a car but can also take a bus to the town.

I wouldn't suggest sharing the space with someone you're not \"super comfortable\" with as there's only a curtain separating the toilet inside the studio so you can hear if someone is taking care of business, haha.

North Shore food carts, off-shore snorkeling, and beautiful white sandy beaches are at your fingertips! If I ever come back to the North Shore I would only do so if I could enjoy this luxury location once again. Craig and his family were extremely personable and friendly.

Definitely a good spot and great value for a single traveler or a couple used to intimate spaces (it is a studio after all).\n\nThe neighborhood has plenty of night life to check out as well as lots of little green spaces for quieter meditation if that's more your thing.  Tompkins Square Park is probably the nicest it's been in about twenty years and a great place to lie on the grass with a book if you don't feel like schlepping to Central Park.  Of course if you do want to get out of the neighborhood, the L train is close, plus there's a crosstown bus at the end of the block if an 8 minute walk to the subway seems just too much (but then I'd have to ask what you're doing in New York any way?) so there's no excuse not to get out there and see whatever you want."},{"_id":"202012363","date":{"$date":"2017-10-09T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4659046","reviewer_id":"830546","reviewer_name":"Pat","comments":"Excellent host, place, location, value.

The building is in a convenient location - close to the subway, restaurants \u0026 grocery stores, neighborhood is quiet for Brooklyn. We were travelling with two kids, and Ryan made sure there was adequate sleeping arrangements (crib \u0026 kids mattress) even offering an AC unit for their bedroom during the heatwave. A leak from the upstairs tenants' bathroom created a decent-sized hole over the shower; Ryan arranged to have a plumber come out and correct the problem, although the hole itself wasn't covered while we were there, at least there wasn't more water leaking down.\r\n\r\nThe downside: AC in the listing means AC in the living room. (and in our second week a floor-standing one for the kids' room) The bedroom has a fan; ideally we would have slept with the door open for cross-ventilation, but the shared stairwell made that a little awkward..\r\n\r\nUntil I saw the layout of the building I didn't fully comprehend the \"shared stairwell\" -  the doors of both bedrooms, the bathroom, and the kitchen/living room open into this stairwell. Going from bedroom to bathroom means going through the shared hallway. Not sure how many people live on the upper floors, but at least 6 different people were around while I was there. You're definitely aware of being in a shared house; it's not a self-contained apartment. \r\n\r\nThe neighbors were generally quiet - the noisiest one in the building was our youngest, who was teething at the time. Sorry to the folks upstairs - he doesn't normally yell like that! \r\n\r\nAs Ryan mentions in the ad, the building is in the process of being renovated, so there are tools in the hallway upstairs, a stack of flooring in the bedroom, and other signs of work. \r\n\r\nOverall, I think this place is a good fit for folks who are looking for no-frills accommodation and don't mind a slightly-less private arrangement than your average apartment."},{"_id":"20382350","date":{"$date":"2014-09-28T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"466277","reviewer_id":"310250","reviewer_name":"Karine","comments":"I stayed at Ryan \u0026 Leda’s place with three friends for a long weekend.

Thank you!\r\n\r\nThe house:\r\nThe advertised photo's are very true to how the apartment looks. It is a very cozy home in two levels with lots of personal items to make it feel like home. If your travelling with a child there are a lot of toys in the house and the kids room is very cute (my personal favourite spot inside the house). The house is still being renovated so don't expect everything to look perfect and there are building materials stored behind the bed, but it is clean and tidy.\r\nWe arrived the day that the temperature dropped to freezing for the first time this winter. There seemed to be an issue with the central heating, but with individual heaters in both the living room on the ground floor, and the kids room on the first floor, the house stayed toasty warm as long as the doors to the rooms were kept open.\r\nBecause of the freezing temperatures we did not utilise the outdoor back area at all, which means that the place is a little pricy for what you get, but if we ever come back during the summer we will definitely think about staying here again.\r\n\r\nArea:\r\nThe area is exactly as advertised. The place is situated in a quiet street in close walking distances to most things you may need on a holiday such as a grocery store, cafe with good coffee, bagel shop and the metro line going in to Manhattan.

Y se puede conectar el ipad a la televisión para ver lo que tú desees, nosotros por ejemplo veíamos Netflix por ella.

The layout -- with bedrooms upstairs and kitchen and living areas downstairs -- worked well to let our kids sleep while we got our morning caffeine fix or enjoyed TV or music to wind down at night. The bedrooms and bathroom were just as large as those in our suburban single-family home, and the whole place was thoughtfully furnished. Street parking seemed plentiful, and Ryan provided all the tips we needed for nearby grocery stores, restaurants and parks. His communications were friendly, prompt and clear.\n\nIf traveling with very young children or people who could have trouble with stairs, bear in mind that the two floors are connected by a narrow and somewhat uneven staircase.

The two bedrooms were comfortable. Nice colorful and safe neighborhood. Yes it is crowded street parking only but I didn't have much trouble finding a spot. For us, the 4 minute walk to the subway station was great. just another few minutes on the L train and we were in Manhattan. You can easily go deeper downtown by transferring at the Union Square station. The apt is just skip away from a grocery store, coffee shops, and pizza places.

We were able to commute to the L train and bus stop B48 within 5 to 7 minutes. Sometimes its better to take the buses than to take the subways. The subways are super packed and it's hot, plus a lot of stairs u p.k and down.  Be sure to buy a metro card for a week, its worth it. When we first got there it was tricky because we had to go through one door to get to the true entrance door. I loved that there was a washer and dryer. There was dish soap and plenty of toilet paper for us for a week. I also loved that there were plenty of towels. We couldn't figure out how to work the coffee machine,  it would be nice to have a note near the coffee maker on how to work it or it didn't work.  The coffee shop on main st called Porto Rico was good there was also tea. We liked that there was a TV with chromecast. However, we would have liked to watch the local news. Cable would have been nice. We had our 2 year old daughter with us and they had a full size stroller which was helpful but it was dirty and crumbs everywhere. There was a playpen that they had and it was nice. In the second room in the bottom drawers there were clothes in there. It would be nice to not have personal items at an airbnb.  There were personal items in the bathroom too. In the bathroom the heater has a cover that kept falling. Keep in mind there are stairs that go to the 2 bedrooms and to the bathroom. It does state in the posting that there are stairs so we knew this coming in. The bathroom was dirty with dust and hair.  Downstairs is a 1/4 bathroom that has a sink and mirror only.  Other than the few things we mentioned that we didnt like, my family and I would stay again.  Thank you Ryan for letting us stay at your place."},{"_id":"334154226","date":{"$date":"2018-10-08T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"466277","reviewer_id":"1938530","reviewer_name":"Hilary","comments":"This was a great place to stay.

Ademas hay un supermercado muy completo a una avenida (9na av. entre las calles 23 y 24) donde encontraréis cualquier cosa que podáis necesitar. Meritxell es muy buena anfitriona, respondió muy rápido todas nuestras preguntas y fue flexible con nuestras necesidades. Recomiendo sinceramente su casa como opción de alojamiento.\r\n\r\nHe passat 5 dies amb la meva familia a l'apartament de la Meritxell i ens hem sentit com a casa. L'apartament és realment acollidor i tranquil i tot funciona correctament. La ubicació és immillorable per visitar Manhattan, la 'High Line' passa just pel costat i hi ha una estació de metro a dues avingudes. A més a més hi ha un supermercat ben assortit a un bloc (9na av. entre els carrers 23 i 24) ón trobareu tot el que us pugui fer falta. La Meritxell es molt bona anfitriona, va contestar immediatament tots els dubtes i va ser flexible amb les nostres necessitats. Recomano de tot cor la seva casa com a opció d'allotjament.\r\n "},{"_id":"77171555","date":{"$date":"2016-05-30T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4709568","reviewer_id":"32694197","reviewer_name":"Adam","comments":"Great apartment in great location.

It is an honor system if you use something you replace it and if you buy something extra you just add it to the collection. It works really well. Having a 24 hour chemist in the corner that sells everything made this very easy to restock. \n\nCommunication with meritxell was great. I certainly would recommend this apartment to anyone.

It's an easy walk from Penn Station and literally feet from the Highline.  I was here with 3 women friends and the apartment worked great.  2 bathrooms not a must, but pretty nice when there are 4 of you.  King bed in master with it's own bath was comfortable and spacious.  2nd bedroom with queen also comfortable.  The fold out in the living room could use a new mattress and there is no way to darken the windows if someone is sleeping there (which we did).  However, it was not a problem for us.  The living room is spacious and allowed comfortable lounging to hang out, talk, and recover from exploring the city. Meritxell is  great in communicating, responding quickly and helpful.  Apartment is very clean and comfortable.  Also, with windows closed, it VERY quiet.  Kitchen is well equipped and although we didn't cook meals we did have breakfast and drinks and appetizers several times.  Plenty of knives, glasses, etc. to make this easy.  The kitchen  is also stocked with basic food items (sugar, coffee filters, napkins, spices, etc.) which is also nice.\nIf you are a walker this is ideal location.  We walked down and back to Battery Park one day and up and back to Central Park then next.  The Highline is outside your door, so super accessible. An inexpensive Uber or cab ride  up to theater (Times Square).  LOTS of good restaurants, grocery store, liquor store, etc. within easy walk (this is NYC so not unusual, but still good to know). \nFelt very safe coming and going to this apartment.  24 hour door man was a plus as was having an elevator, not lugging luggage up stairs is nice.\nWas a perfect apartment for our needs.

The doormen were very nice.\n\n We literally walked a few steps out the front door and up onto The High Line, which is fabulous, and it ends at the wonderful Chelsea Market! \nDon Giovanni around corner on 10th was great Italian and we found a great breakfast two blocks down at Chelsea Square (open 24 hr for those wee hours.)\n\nDon't forget (newcomers to NYC) that if you get the weekly subway pass that you can also ride the bus, too.\n\nTracy - Chattanooga, TN"},{"_id":"200461169","date":{"$date":"2017-10-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4709568","reviewer_id":"47687885","reviewer_name":"Jill","comments":"Meritxell's apartment is located Right next to the Highline in the popular area of Chelsea.  \nMeritxell was always very prompt at responding to any questions we had and the doormen were extremely helpful and friendly giving advice on best routes etc \nThe apartment was a fantastic base for our week long stay in NY with the added bonus of a balcony.

Meritxell finally responded and admitted that she was aware about airco broen downand would send a technician to look at it. The technician came and could not fix it so we had no choice but to looked for a new accommodation as it was not possible to stay without airco during hot August in NYC. Managed to get a full refund back from AirBnB but had to pay almost double to 2 hotel rooms due to last minute booking in high season. I understand this thing can happen but would appreciate if the host informed us upfront about the issue so we can already prepared for alternative solutions and not to find out ourselves after checking-in; having to spend hours looking for a solution and moving to another place."},{"_id":"309121984","date":{"$date":"2018-08-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4709568","reviewer_id":"187150011","reviewer_name":"Alisha","comments":"Beautiful apartment in a fantastic location!"},{"_id":"313008913","date":{"$date":"2018-08-24T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4709568","reviewer_id":"160212434","reviewer_name":"Karen","comments":"A wonderful apartment in a fantastic location.

Be prepared to pay a 30 euro initial check in fee and tourist tax (~2-3 euros per day) for each day each person is there at check in (not included in cost of place)... the place was very well stocked and had everything we needed. There was mold in the shower, a couple leaky/loose faucets, and guests are expected to buy their own toilet paper once the partial first roll provided was gone.

The roof terrace was nice to have, though we didn't personally end up using it much after all due to rain. Was a bit noisy at night with the echo of people outside even with the windows closed. Overall, an amazing location for the price and cozy quarters to make you truly feel like you live in Barcelona for a few days. Kitchen is fully equipped if interested to make a meal.

The host was gracious, friendly, and offered assistance should we need it (we didn't). The only other feedback I would give is that I was not able to confirm check in details until the day before my trip although I had been messaging for several days. When I finally connected with the host, he advised that he preferred me to either call or text upon arrival, which was difficult as I was not planning on bringing a cell phone with an international plan with me on the trip, which I ended up changing at the last minute so that I'd be able to connect with the host."},{"_id":"338256732","date":{"$date":"2018-10-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4725257","reviewer_id":"19656005","reviewer_name":"Edvin","comments":"We loved Marta and Paul's place.

Very cute little apartment with a rustic feel with wood beams across the ceiling and brick accent walls. Perfect little place to recharge between adventures in Barcelona. Most important to us was the location of the apartment. You are just steps away from the nearest metro stop for the L3 line at Drassanes. Either way gets you to Plaza Espanya or Plaza Catalunya in just a couple minutes. You are just a 10-15 minute walk away from Barcenoleta and the beach. In general very centrally located.\n\nMake sure you are okay with stairs. Walking up and down 5 flights is a good workout. You are very centrally located thus get some street noise at night especially during weekends.

On the other hand, if you have one or two bags, and don’t mind the daily forced exercise, then you’ll enjoy the apartment! Also, it had a bit of a musty smell when I arrived, but this was quickly cleared with the several windows. If your priorities are location and budget, I recommend it."}]}

We believe he can do much more than just accommodating guests. We arrived at the hotel at 11 pm. After dropping us off, the driver asked if the host who was standing in front of the car can give a hand to lift our luggage. But the host seemed to so enjoy resting his hands in his warm and lovely pockets that he refused to help us. It is definitely the first time for us to receive a NO from a host of a hotel when we asked for help to handle the luggage. But luckily, it is also the last time - in following trips to Pamukkale, Ephesus, and Ankara, all hosts helped us without even asking. After we were inside the hotel and ready for checking in, the host suddenly claimed that our reservation has been altered. Another group of guests who lived in our reserved rooms and should check out this morning had their flight cancelled. So they quickly made a reservation again for the same room. Very coincidently, their reservation request was sent right before ours, the reservation system on hotel`s computer approved theirs and ignored ours, but somehow our reservation still got a confirmation though it should not. Hence, our reservation was actually failed in the system and now we had to move to another apartment. We found this explanation rather funny. Our reservation was confirmed in November, a month ago. Nevertheless, that reservation request sent today by other guests still managed to appear on the reservation system one second ahead of ours. It got approved, and therefore kicked us out. Hence, we made the assumption to explain such impossibility: 1. The reservation request by other guests can time travel, and it successfully went through a wormhole and arrived in the reservation system one month before it sent. 2. The internet connection between Germany and Turkey is inhumanly poor, such that our reservation request has delayed for a whole month and unfortunately conflicts with other guests` request. 3. The reservation system software is buggy. After we pointed out the illogic points in his explanation, the host`s shining face turned grey as his feeling was hurt. He decided not to defend for himself or find excuses anymore; he solidly told us, if we are not satisfied with the alternation, we could, of course, call Airbnb customer service for help, and we could, of course, go out and find another hotel for settling. I had to admit it was a brilliant fight back against us. He clearly understood that, on a December night, one is not stupid enough to give up an available apartment and risk spending all night on finding a new one. We have no choice but shut up. As a result, four people of us moved from an apartment with 6 beds to a smaller apartment with 2 beds, which is smelly and noisy.

El pueblo no tiene mucho que visitar, pero tiene todo lo necesario para vivir y n restaurante donde comer baratísimo grandes cantidades de una comida buenísima y con un personal muy agradable.

If anything, it was a little further out of the way from Porto town as we expected (About 1 hour train ride), but the train took us direct after a 25 minute walk to the nearby train station first. \n\nWe had a very enjoyable stay and we are all very sad to leave. \n\nThank You Clara and your helpful staff. \n\nFaye\n\n"},{"_id":"159190999","date":{"$date":"2017-06-10T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4742607","reviewer_id":"79959482","reviewer_name":"Rens","comments":"Beautiful house for a luxurious stay."},{"_id":"163247460","date":{"$date":"2017-06-24T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4742607","reviewer_id":"9549278","reviewer_name":"Tuulia","comments":"Absolutely amazing place, highly recommended!

We felt transported to another time, yet enjoyed all the modern conveniences of en-suite bathrooms, well equipped kitchen, TV, wifi, swimming pool, etc. The grounds are spectacular, full of fruit trees and a mountain path for walking. Casimir the caretaker was extremely welcoming and responsive to our needs, though we had want for little as the home was well equipped with dishes, towels, linens, etc. We were also so impressed with how immaculately clean the house and grounds were - no small feat for sure as the space seems endless!

We had an absolutely amazing time. \n\nClara was extremely responsive and her local manager of the property gave us a wonderful welcome and checked on us throughout our visit to make sure we were okay. \n\nThe house and surrounding property are MASSIVE and absolutely STUNNING. The property is extremely well-located - rural enough to feel like you've gotten away from the hustle and bustle of the city, and central enough to be walking distance to a train station, bakery and grocery stores. There is a large Lidl about 10 minutes' drive away from the house. \n\nMost of the group shared rental cars to reach the property (35 minute drive from Porto) although some people travelled by taxi/ uber from Porto. Two people travelled back by train and walked from the property to the station without issue. \n\nThe house is extremely well equipped. We cooked large meals for the group throughout the weekend without issue (there are multiple ovens and stoves, as well as a BBQ). \n\nThe pool is perfect, as is the lounging area around it. \n\nThere are fruit and chestnut trees on the property, and we picked fresh lemons for one of our dinners. \n\nThere is a hiking trail on the property so you can climb up the mountain behind it. You get stunning views of the area as you climb. \n\nI have nothing negative to say about this AirBnb experience. It was absolutely perfect in every way, shape and form. I had a wonderful birthday weekend at Casa Vileta. A MASSIVE thank you to Clara and her team. I will be recommending this property to friends and family."},{"_id":"208410988","date":{"$date":"2017-11-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4742607","reviewer_id":"63888571","reviewer_name":"Joao","comments":"A Casa de Vilela é um espaço único, cujas salas emanam uma história passada nobre, rodeada de um ambiente natural único.

The apartment was also clean and well stocked with toiletries. In my opinion it's better suited as accommodation for up to 5 people because it was a tight squeeze with 6 adults, a child and all the accompanying suitcases.\n\nSomething we found unsatisfactory was that one of the bath towels provided in the master bedroom appeared to be old and stained. Perhaps this was a mixup by the cleaners?\n\nI'd also suggest improving fridge access by replacing it with one that has doors opening to the left.\n\nWould stay again if there was a smaller group of us travelling.\n"},{"_id":"57434312","date":{"$date":"2015-12-26T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4755673","reviewer_id":"25724829","reviewer_name":"Nora","comments":"The house is nice and well equipped.

Big enough for 6 persons (good western standard).

There is in each room its own air conditioning and everything is super clean. The two bathrooms including toilets are also big enough. We even cooked and used the washing machine. WLAN worked excellent.\n\nWe had asked Jenny before our arrival for washing powder, answer came within 15 minutes.\nUnfortunately, we did not meet Jenny personally, since from check-in to the departure everything worked perfectly.\n\nThe location itself is perfect. I have no other comparison, but I think that there is no better location in Hong Kong. Wan Chai - MTR station within 8 minutes walking distance, some buses outside the door (we did not use). Supermarket 3 minutes away, KFC right in the basement of the building, McDonalds also close by. The building itself, as well as the entire city is very safe. You can not enter the building without code/card and there is a guard around the clock at the elevators\n\nMy family and I would definitely book the apartment again if we travel again to Hong Kong!\n\nKind regards!\nMarco\n\n"},{"_id":"159416477","date":{"$date":"2017-06-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4755673","reviewer_id":"12458566","reviewer_name":"Emily","comments":"Good location which is close to MTR station.

This is our favorite so far. I read hundreds of reviews before choosing this place. It is difficult to find a budget friendly ,modern place for families in the heart of the city! My highest priority was that is was centrally located,  quiet at night, and had strong air -conditioning. Most places in China are smaller,  in size,so keep that in mind.This was perfect for us! To find a place with 2 full-size beds and a set of bunk beds ,and 2 baths with showers is rare! It is nicely remodeled. We did not need a view as being quiet downtown in the city was more important. The building had solid windows and flooring to filter noise.Many places in China are brand new but with inferior building materials and one can hear everything next door and outside. Owner was very helpful and responsive. Extra toiletries, hair dryer, adaptor  plugs, iron and making extra phone calls for us was very kind.Great places to eat nearby including terrific local dim sum, Gengki sushi or even Italian are restaurants.McDonalds and KFC are at the doorstep. Fresh market outside only a couple places away. So close to subway. Loved staying here and highly recommend for smaller families (The double beds are,smaller, than USA (Website hidden by Airbnb) keep) that in mind) It is a fair price for the terrific location and accomadations offered.

We walked around HK until just before check in time at 1.10pm. When we got there there were no keys in the letter box as arranged. I called Jenny and she asked if I was checking in today! Alarm bells ringing in my head. This question was asked after I had emailed her around four times a couple of days beforehand to finalise arrangements and dates. She told me to wait 5 minutes and her staff would be there. 50 minutes later her cleaner eventually arrived. You can imagine the state my family were in waiting in 34 degree heat. When the cleaner let us in, the flat was a mess as it hadn't been cleaned from the previous stayer. We all had to wait then while the cleaner cleaned the flat around us and changed the bed sheets while we sat on the sofa. Not a happy experience at all and definitely not what you need after a 12 hour flight and walking around HK for 6 hours."},{"_id":"181567463","date":{"$date":"2017-08-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4755673","reviewer_id":"105873843","reviewer_name":"진아","comments":"편의 시설과 가까우며 교통이 편리함.\n숙소는 겉모습과는 달리 안모습은 깔끔하고 아늑함.\n친절하고 연락도 잘 되어 만족"},{"_id":"184062101","date":{"$date":"2017-08-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4755673","reviewer_id":"24024638","reviewer_name":"Iain","comments":"Compact unit, right in the heart of Hong-Kong.

We also walked with our two young kids to the star ferry pier as well. \nThe rooms are tiny but it is great to have three separate rooms and it helped to have two separate bathrooms as well. \n\n\nThe entrance is a little hard to spot and the street is gated off in front of the entrance so it’s a bit inconvenient if you are traveling with a lot of luggage. We were on our way back home from a several month long trip in Asia so we had several luggages and two sleepy kids so it was a bit difficult moving in and out of the apartment. \n\nOur major downside to the experience was that there was a renovation in the unit facing the Airbnb unit and it had no door or tarps to block off the dust and fumes so the dust was even accumulating inside the Airbnb unit. The noise was quite unbearable on one of the days. When the issue was brought up to Jenny, she was considerate enough to give us partial refund to compensate for our inconvenience. HK has a lot of renovations going on at most locations so I think it’s vital to check with host before booking. \n\nEverything in the Airbnb was very clean and working functionally. \n\nWe would love to stay at Jenny’s aptmt again if we are traveling to HK again."},{"_id":"404411645","date":{"$date":"2019-01-24T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4755673","reviewer_id":"144213073","reviewer_name":"琦","comments":"非常棒!房源位置离地铁站也很方便,五分钟不到就能走到~安保设施也非常齐全☺房间内的WiFi也很快,房东小姐姐人真的特别好,允许行李寄存!很方便很贴心❤以后来HK还会首选这里的~"},{"_id":"406788849","date":{"$date":"2019-01-31T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4755673","reviewer_id":"23559770","reviewer_name":"Yury","comments":"Жили в квартире у Jenny неделю.

Wan Chai is very centrally located, and her apartment is steps to the Ding Ding and bus stop and about a seven minute walk to the subway. As she mentioned, the E11 airport bus stop is also quite near. It was convenient having a full service supermarket right downstairs to pick up snacks, fruit, and water. There are also plenty of local restaurants and some quick foreign places (i.e. McDonalds, Starbucks, and KFC) really close by. \nIt was nice to have 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. The room with the bunkbeds is very narrow (about the width of two twin beds), so you won't be able to store suitcases in that room if you want to have space to walk. The showers had excellent water pressure and the water was always nice and warm. We didn't need AC in February, but it would certainly be nice in the summer. \nLastly, we were asked if we were staying in an Air BnB, so be prepared for this question. \nIn sum, we enjoyed our stay and would recommend Jenny's place to others. Jenny always answered my questions quickly and was a considerate host."}]}

The apartment is in the ocean tower which Is set back from the water a little, and has a sunny view south to the Marriott and it’s lagoon, and out west to the ocean. It’s really a five star property throughout - very well maintained,  beautiful pools and landscaping, and a real attention to detail. The apartment itself is great\nwith high end appliances and finishes. The layout works well for families with three bd/ba and the doors open wide onto the sunny deck. \nThe lagoon outside was quieter than the crowded beaches at Aulani/4 Seasons to the North and the Marriott to the South. Surprisingly good snorkeling in the beautiful clear water - and Denice’s place has plenty of beach equipment to use.  Would recommend Ko Olina and this apartment for sure but ensure you check minimum # of rental days directly with Denice to avoid confusion.

In cucina vari tipi di cereali, latte e uova, frutta fresca e vari prodotti per la colazione oltre che caffè espresso con moka gigante. Unico difetto riguardante l'uso della cucina è l'orario, limitato dalle 9am in poi; Perciò noi la usavamo verso le 6am per non uscire tardi di casa. Ottime indicazioni per arrivare a casa dal JFK date da Agnes . Ottima posizione della casa: metro a un minuto a piedi (10 minuti per Rockfeller Center con metro express) oppure autobus per Central Park in 30 min. Bagno pulito, così come la cucina. Cambio delle lenzuola e degli asciugamani ogni tre giorni circa. Ci sono altri due coinquilini fissi, per cui bisogna stare attenti agli orari in cui si usa il bagno, anche se Agnes ti informa dei loro orari, quindi è facile regolarsi. La stanza è molto grande per due persone; Noi eravamo in tre perciò con il mega materasso gonfiabile aggiuntivo, le dimensioni della stanza si sono ridotte (le valigie stavano chiuse nell'armadio).

She detailly showed us around the house. Lastly, the guest can have a full access to her kitchen, which is fully stock of food. We saved a couple bucks for a long trip by eating breakfast at her house. Also, there is a park with a pool outside the apartment, which played music every weekend in the summer.

A bit outside the hustle and bustle of Lower Manhattan and Midtown, Agnes' Harlem refuge is a welcome oasis after a day in the city. While it's (literally) feet from a subway stop, we had a hard time finding places to go out for food/drink in the area so you may want to look elsewhere if you're planning on that sort of thing.

I cant even describe what a pleasure it was to stay with her. Firstly, she kept in contact with me from the moment I booked the place and answered all my questions. When we arrive she organised snacks waiting for us in our room and let us use her food coffee and teas in the kitchen, which was lovely and does not happen very often with other hosts.  On top of all of this, I had an Unfortunate accident on the first night I stayed there, and had to go the hospital to get some medicine. Agnes was really concerned and worried and kept asking how I feel. She even refunded some money to me to cover some of the expenses. Even tho it was just and accident and there was no one to blame. A lovely and kind gesture.  The location was fantastic as well metro station just around the corner which takes you anywhere you want and runs the whole night. It even takes you pretty much straight to the JFK airport. In general we had a fantastic time in New York and in this place. I would recommend it to everyone , and would love to be back.\r\nOnce again thanks Agnes for your hospitality and everything.

Obwohl unser Flug Verspätung hatte und wir mitten in der Nacht ankamen, hat Agnes auf uns gewartet und uns empfangen. Wir hatten die 9 Tage lang nichts vermisst, Frühstück und Zutaten für Sandwiches o.ä. waren immer vorhanden und sie achtete auf eine gute Ernährung (Mandelmilch, organisches Obst, 3 verschiedene Brotarten und und und), was uns unglaublich zugesagt hatte. \nKleine Gesten, die wir absolut nicht erwartet hatten, machten den Aufenthalt zu einem wundervollem ersten airbnb-Erlebnis! Es ist sauber bei Agnes, es wird regelmäßig geputzt und die Bettwäsche und die Handtücher werden bei längeren Aufenthalt gewechselt. Anzumerken ist vielleicht auch noch, dass Agnes so unglaublich hilfsbereit war, egal in welcher Hinsicht! Sie hatte immer gute Tips, ein offenes Ohr und zögerte nicht, bei Problemen oder Wünschen ihre Hilfe anzubieten. Ihre Geschichten über New York und ihre Arbeit waren einfach nur toll und wir liebten es, uns mit ihr und unseren anderen Mitbewohnern (ebenfalls aus der USA) zu unterhalten. Wichtig ist vielleicht auch noch anzumerken, dass die Gegend unglaublich sicher war. Gerade mir als Frau lag es am Herzen, keine Angst haben zu müssen und man merkt relativ schnell, dass die Horror-Märchen genau das sind, was sie sind: Märchen. Wir fühlten uns zu zweit nie gefährdet oder bedrängt. \nAlles in einem: ein wundervoller Aufenthalt und eins steht fest: unseren nächsten Aufenthalt in New York verbringen wir wieder bei Agnes!\n\n\nAgnes was just great! Although our flight was delayed and we arrived in the middle of the night, Agnes was waiting for us and welcomed us. We had 9 days missed nothing, breakfast and other ingredients for sandwiches etc. were always available and she paid attention to good nutrition (Almond milk, organic fruit, 3 different types of bread).\nSmall gestures that we had absolutely not expected, made the stay a wonderful first Airbnb-experience.\nThe apartment was very clean, it was cleaned regularly and the bedding and towels were changed at longer stay. Agnes was so incredibly helpful! She always had good advice, a listening ear and did not hesitate to offer their assistance with problems or wishes. Her stories about New York and her work were just great and we loved the conversations with her and the other roommates. It is important also to say that the area, we stayed, was incredibly safe.

Our flight came in around 6am and even though \"full check-in\" wasn't until later (other guests still occupied the place), Agnes let us drop off our bags, clean up and chat a little before we headed out to explore before our long day. \r\n\r\nThe apartment complex has old-school charm in a great way as well as the apartment itself. Everything was very clean and I noticed the bathroom was spotless every time I went in the next day. The room we had was excellent with plenty of space including a comfortable bed (I like firm), television and Agnes even provided an array of snacks, water, juices, coffee, soap, toothbrushes, etc in the room which was awesome. My friend and I felt extremely comfortable in the apartment and used the kitchen everyday for breakfast. We talked to Agnes when she was around and she is an awesome person to conversate with. Very calm, but passionate and well rounded in many areas so you can talk about almost anything. If you need any tips on places to eat or how to get around she will have them for you too. Very responsive via messages/text too, which I'm a big fan. The main bathroom (with shower/bath) is shared, but we never had an issue or wait when we were leaving for the day. It literally felt like a home away from home. I've used airbnb multiple times and this was my best experience using a shared space. I'm usually against it to be honest, but if all hosts are like Agnes and her place I'm open to it again :)\r\n\r\nWe loved the location as well....literally one block away from the Train/Subway station (both express and local) to get you anywhere you want to go. One train can take you to many of the tourist sites, Central Park etc and we found this to be great. The airport was a simple Express train away as well as the AirTrain (must take this in and out of the airport) which was very convenient as well to save on taxi. Plenty of places to eat around (late too), groceries, and we came in late at night and had no feeling of being unsafe whatsoever anytime. The building is also locked and secured and to note has both stairs and an old style elevator (smoother than expected as I fear elevators).\r\n\r\nOverall, more than Excellent experience and my friend and I would recommend Agnes and her place in a heartbeat for a stay in New York. If I go back, I would hope to stay again."},{"_id":"54719126","date":{"$date":"2015-11-23T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"476983","reviewer_id":"45791830","reviewer_name":"Urska","comments":"Our host Agens was amazing!

The apartment building itself was really cool (historic building with lots of character- loved it!) and overlooked a small park. The room and bathroom were both very clean and comfortable. Agnes let us drop off our bags early in the morning before our official check in so we could go explore without being loaded down with heavy backpacks. When we returned, our bags were stored neatly in the room. She even left a small table of snacks and beverages for us in case we got hungry. The neighborhood is quiet, and my sister and I had no reservations in walking from the apartment all the way to Central Park. Public transportation was also easily accessible.

We stayed 5 night and she also tidied up the room for us and even changed bed-sheets and towels which we really appreciated!  \r\nRoom can be very warm as the heating system is centralized and is ON for many hours also overnight. There is no possibility to open the windows which are sealed around the air conditioner system, as shown in the pictures and the radiators cannot be shut. Agnes however provides a fan which kind of helped. Still tropical temperature tho, which we nevertheless did not mind as it was a very cold week of March.

Nous avons pu déposer nos bagages dans le couloir et profiter de notre première journée. Le soir à notre retour, Agnès avait nettoyé la chambre et rangé nos bagages dans celle-ci. Nous avons trouvé de quoi grignoter et boire, des serviettes de bain propres et quelques ustensiles bien utiles (sèche cheveux et fer à repasser), la chambre était semblable aux photos sauf  le lit qui a sûrement dû être remplacer par un nouveau lit. Le bâtiment est assez àncien mais propre et situé dans un quartier vivant et calme  à deux pas du métro. Nous avons pu utiliser la cuisine au moment du petit déjeuner. Agnès nous a beaucoup renseigné sur les incontournables de New York et nous a énormément conseillées ! J'ai vraiment apprécié mon séjour chez Agnès et je n'hésiterai pas à retourner chez elle très vite je l'espère ! :) jai beaucoup apprécié exercer mon anglais en discutant avec notre hôte !

She recommended several eating spots and I have to say one of my best parts of the trip was that I didn't have a bad meal the entire time.  If you are brave enough to jump on the subway, Agnes is like a walking map of the transportation system in New York and she will send very specific instructions how to navigate the routes.  Agnes is a great person to sit and talk with as she has some great life experiences to share.  She will be my first choice should I make another trip to New York.

Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis perfekt.\r\nEs gibt (mindestens) zwei zu vermietende Zimmer in der Wohnung, eines größer, das andere etwas kleiner. Wir hatten das erste, etwas größere Zimmer am Eingang, zum ruhigen Hinterhof. Das Foto stimmt nicht mehr bzgl des Bettes. Das jetzt dort stehende Bett hat keinen Nachttisch, es gibt auch keine Nachttischlampen, nur eine Deckenlampe. Fernseher war angeblich gerade kaputt gegangen. Fehlte uns aber nicht. Zimmer nüchtern, aber praktisch. Der lichte Charakter des Fotos etwas irreführend. Eher Zimmer zum unbelebten Hinterhof, es guckt aber keiner rein, Jalousie.\r\nHeizung springt bei etwas kühleren Temperaturen automatisch an und lässt sich nicht regulieren, pfeift. Zum Abkühlen gibt es mobilen Ventilator und Klimaanlage im Fenster. Mmm. Nicht sehr umweltfreundlich, aber wohl standard.\r\nWohnung gepflegt und Badezimmer mit Dusch-Badewanne sehr sauber. Gute und reichlich Handtücher. Auf Wunsch haben wir auch zweites Laken und Decke fürs Doppelbett bekommen.\r\nIn kleiner Küche alles vorhanden, um sich selbst Frühstück zuzubereiten. Sehr praktisch. Im Wohnzimmer zwei abgesessene Couchs und kleine Klapptische, herrliche Aussicht über Harlem vom Podest der Feuerleiter aus, auf dem wir morgens unseren Kaffee getrunken haben.\r\nBeim Ankommen statt eines \"Hello\" erstmal Hinweis, dass in der Wohnung keine Schuhe getragen werden dürfen. Also Hausschuhe oder dicke Strümpfe mitbringen. Schuhe draußen im Hausflur ausziehen. Begrüßung dadurch etwas kurios:-)\r\nFür uns etwas undurchsichtig, wer uns eigentlich begrüßt hat.

It is like living with a guide. The apartment was stocked with so much food, snacks, and any kind of amenity one would need. The neighborhood seemed very safe and friendly. The apartment was very clean and had easy access to metro stations. I was dissapointed about parking however but this is not the hosts' fault. If you drive, getting a parking spot on the street may be very difficult or impossible depending when you arrive. I drove my car and was needing to leave it in a worry free place for 6 nights. Since I arrived on a Saturday night all spaces were taken so I parked in a bus stop area the first night, got lucky and didnt get a ticket. The next morning, I called local parking garages, the first two were full, some didnt offer overnight parking. I found one very close by, about a block. It cost me $170 dollars for 6 days, but my car was safe. I would stay with Agnes again but I will never drive to NYC again."},{"_id":"104253391","date":{"$date":"2016-09-25T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"476983","reviewer_id":"23375420","reviewer_name":"Melissa","comments":"Our host was very accommodating to us throughout our stay, but also let us check in with her early in the morning to drop off our luggage and offered to let us leave our bags after check until our late departure.

We were given the grand tour of her lovely, spacious apartment, and generously offered some goodies upon arrival. Once the basics were discussed, we were left to enjoy our room and explore Harlem with a wealth of information on the neighborhood. The building itself has an exciting history, as well as the street on which the apartment is located. If Agnes is around, allow her to enlighten you on some of those things.\n\nHarlem is a dining mecca, and you will find no shortage of great places to eat within walking distance. We found some delicious Soul Food and live music, and even stopped to chat (and eat some more!) with a local who was barbecuing on the street. If you end up booking with Agnes, please be sure to read the Welcome Letter you receive in its entirety. There's a lot of good stuff in there. Also, make check-in arrangements ahead of time out of courtesy. Agnes schedules her day around your arrival...because that's what families do!"},{"_id":"108524708","date":{"$date":"2016-10-16T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"476983","reviewer_id":"19915783","reviewer_name":"Katie","comments":"Agnes was very welcoming!

There's an assortment of snacks and beverages in the room. All linens are fresh or new. Toiletries are available as well. She provides detailed information about her neighborhood and the city prior to your arrival. She's approachable and friendly. Agnes is also fluent in at least three other languages. No matter where you're from or your reason for visiting NYC, I feel she's relatable to most people.

If you're headed to NYC, it doesn't get better than staying at Agnes's place. The apartment is located just a two-minute walk to the subway, and you're just three quick stops from Time Square! My family and I drove in from CT and I was particularly worried about having to pay for parking, especially since Agnes's place is in the city. Nope! Free street parking, which was so great for us! Also, Agnes is a wonderful host! Everything she described was exactly what we got, and then some. Want breakfast? The kitchen is completely available to you. Want information about the city? Agnes has it! She was even so sweet as to buy our 1.5 year-old son chocolate milk!\n\nIf you're headed to NYC, this is where you want to be. We will DEFINITELY stay here again.

First I will address the actual apartment. \n\nVery very clean! I can not stress this enough. Yes, you must take off your shoes before entering. House rules. I stayed in the first bedroom for 10 nights. I was provided 6 towels (3 per person) and our sheets were washed twice during our stay. On the table in the bedroom was a supply of beverages, snacks, and toothpaste/mouthwash/toothbrushes. Some of these drinks were very nice and definitely above what you will get anywhere else. Agnes also provided a gallon of water at the start, and actually kept replacing it as we used the water. \n\nEvery day I noticed the bathroom being cleaned. By the way, Agnes provides a host of shampoos/body washes/bar soap. \n\nThe kitchen has a supply of breakfast foods, some very very nice, for guests. This was such a treat to have some fruit and the option of bagels and eggs and organic foods there. \n\nI have seen some reviews mention that Agnes was not very friendly. I don't know how they could have gotten that impression at all, unless perhaps they were not used to the New York briskness that some people there have. She was an incredible host, very accommodating with check in Times. She constantly provided us with ideas and suggestions of places to see and restaurants to visit and even gave us some of the history/trivia of the areas around the city. I was genuinely welcomed and happy to stay in her home. \n\nFor a neat freak like me, I was thrilled with how clean the apartment was. I was so happy to have a taste of the real 'New Yorker' experience. \n\nI would completely recommend this place to anyone wanting a safe place to stay. I was nervous about staying in Harlem but truly to neighborhood was incredible. I felt safe and completely comfortable, even as a small town gal from Alaska. \n\nTen out of ten, would stay here again!! I highly recommend this place to everyone!!

To have a host that was not friendly or barely communicated was a little odd especially when she was home all day and right down the hall. We had to remove our shoes at all times yet the floors where so dirty we had to constantly wipe off our feet or pull off the debris before placing our shoes on. Our room did not look like the photos, a TV was shown and one was not there. Yes snacks where provided and appreciated but that does not make up for the fact that we felt ignored when I would call her and be sent to voicemail. We were also suppose to be given WiFi which was also never obtained the entire trip.

However, the two big points are:  \n\n1) that I stayed one night at the end of January and the room was sweltering hot and barely cooled down in the 12 hours I was there. The heating unit was a radiator, which I've never had experience with. The Airbnb app delayed my messages to the host or something because she didn't see them until much later, after which she did adjust the heating. \n\nAnd 2) The room is in an apartment building in Washington Heights. Having never been to New York, it was a personal lack of knowledge/experience that meant I didn't know distances between things or where all the action is or which are touristy places. But three Uber drivers and several personal friends made me feel really uncomfortable about having to stay there. \n\nHowever, neither of these things are really in the host's control. Its more of Airbnb's side on the location and app shortcomings. (And some people might appreciate an 85° room when it's 40 outside)\n\nOn the plus side, 1) everything seemed clean, freshly laundered, etc., 2) this host allows you to leave your luggage with her before check-in, which was great and 90% of the reason I chose her, 3) it sounded like she cleaned the bathroom between guests taking showers, 4) there were snacks and drinks available in the personal bedroom, and I believe? the kitchen was there for guests to use freely, 5) the bed is at a height easily accessible to children and the elderly, and 6) the host seemed friendly and ready to accommodate and answer questions."},{"_id":"407271662","date":{"$date":"2019-02-01T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"476983","reviewer_id":"17981320","reviewer_name":"Luisa Fernanda","comments":"La habitación que te provee es cómoda, la conexión a internet es mala desde la habitación por lo cual tienes que salir siempre al pasillo para tener una mejor recepción, los detalles que deja en la habitación son fenomenales como bebidas, dulces, snacks y elementos de aseo.\n\n\nEn general es una estadía cómoda a buen precio, el sector es alejado de los sitios turísticos de NY pero nada que el metro no pueda solucionar."},{"_id":"408790943","date":{"$date":"2019-02-05T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"476983","reviewer_id":"11526867","reviewer_name":"Rosa","comments":"We have stayed in many airbnb spaces over the years, and this one has been truly outstanding.

There is one double bedroom with no mattress (and very hard bedspring). A second room can be made out of the living room by closing a metallic partition and consists of a couch which extends to two single mattresses on different levels. 2 additional people are supposed to sleep in a minuscule room the size of a closet, with barely enough space for two extremely unhealthy mattresses on the floor. This place is set apart from the rest of the apartment, accessible behind the kitchen, and more likely to be a laundry room than a bedroom.\nWe were 5, and one of us was obliged to sleep on the couch and to buy a fan for the nights (no AC in the living room once the partition is closed).\n\nMoreover, as soon as it started raining, the open areas from the ACs began to leak inside the house"},{"_id":"61997334","date":{"$date":"2016-02-10T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4773338","reviewer_id":"35493233","reviewer_name":"Kátia","comments":"A localização do apartamento é muito boa.

Very clean, with all the amenities you could need, full kitchen, all the beach gear, and a great patio to enjoy the evening. It's about 100 yards from a nice, uncrowded beach. Rebecca, the owner is very nice and helpful, leaving us chocolates and coffee upon our arrival. Choosing this cottage is way, way, way better than staying in a hotel... \nI would hate to hurt Rebecca's bookings however, in full disclosure the beach cottage may not work for two couples. It is however, perfect for a young family. This is due to the second bedroom being \"loft style\" or an \"open bedroom\" with one wall open to the living area. \nWhile the neighbors are all extremely nice and very friendly the neighborhood is a bit noisy. Dogs barking and roosters crowing in the morning, kids playing outside, small arms fire from the nearby military base and the occasional jet flying over, ensure that you won't sleep your vacation away...\nBut if you're looking for a base to operate from while you tour the island and it's beaches this is a good option.\n\n"},{"_id":"62156135","date":{"$date":"2016-02-12T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4774436","reviewer_id":"48082182","reviewer_name":"Nan","comments":"Rebecca was great.

We were there for four days and really enjoyed the beach access just feet away and the super nice neighbors. We had to leave in a hurry due to last minute airline changes and the neighbors learning of our situation even came over to offer any help. So from the beginning to the end of our stay, our experience was absolutely full of that Aloha spirit that Hawaii is so well known for. We plan to travel back to see friends and we plan on staying at the Cottage if it is available. And as a last note, we lived in Ewa Beach, Hi where the Cottage is located for two of the six years we were on Oahu.

Prior to our arrival Rebecca was in communication with me and offered suggestions for sight seeing and fun.  Well do to mechanical issues we arrived late, I advised Rebecca, and she had Ann leave lights on for us, and ultimately refunded one days rental fee, because of the delay. That speaks volumes Rebecca's character and how much she wants to you to enjoy your visit.  \r\nWhen we arrived, Ann and her family greeted us and expressed their concerns for our late arrival.  This was welcoming and we became fast friends with the family.\r\nUpon arrive at the cottage, we made ourselves at home.  It was clean, cozy and comfortable.  It was truly comfortable.  The home is perfect for my family of three plus my mother.  Rebecca and Ann took great care in making sure all our needs were met, from toiletries to towels.  We enjoy dining on the patio set, and our endless days at the beach.  My seven-year-old had a blast with the neighborhood kids, who were also on fall break.  The kids played morning till night, and it was great to actually see boys and girls play together without the interference of technology.  To me this part of our trip was priceless.    On our last night we treated the kids to ice cream, this is truly a neighborhood friendly spot and great for young and mature.  On our last morning, Ann and her family treated us to a traditional Hawaiian breakfast, amazing food and company.  We hated to leave the cottage, with its comfy beds, beautiful beach, new friends, and complete relaxation.  We hope to visit again.   Do not pack your toiletries you won't need them, enjoy the view, the people and the amenities of a home.  This was our first Airbnb experience, and I will never do a hotel again.  Rebecca's home is perfect!  As for my only minor critique, the boogie boards  an snorkeling gear were broken from all the wonderful use prior to our arrival.  Did this matter, not a bit, Walmart is close by to purchase what you need.  Two the beach and water are perfect without the gear.  We were lucky enough to have the true Hawaiian experience and we made new friends.

My husband, newborn son, and I spent all day at the beach and even had the chance to surf the small beach break. Rebecca had beach towels, chairs, and a cooler readily available. There is an outdoor shower with warm water which is perfect for rinsing off after a nice long day at the beach. The property has a nice manicured yard with tables, chairs and huge umbrellas so you may enjoy the evening sunset with a glass of wine outside.

We enjoyed many special family moments on the beautiful front patio and had enough space for our family of 4 adults and 1 child to sleep comfortably and do our daily activities in the clean home.  Rebecca's house was well-equipped with everything we needed for our 6 night stay...a special perk was having a cooler available for us to use on our daily outings.  We left the beautiful beach house yesterday with countless memories from our many adventures on Oahu.

She contacted me a week prior to our visit via phone to tell me about check in and the cottage. Arrival and check in was simple and as explained - we didn't meet Rebecca in person but did get to say hi to her neighbor Ann and family who were very nice locals. We were 2 adults and 2 kids (3.5 year old and infant of 8 mo), and stayed for 9 nights. The cottage is as described. It was roomy enough for us. Dad and toddler stayed in the bedroom with the AC. Baby slept with me partially and in her travel crib (which we brought), in the loft area (no door). The floors are newer and nice. There is a big TV and we used our Netflix on it; they have DirectTV. The shower was nice; hot water is good. We ate meals on the table with room for 4 (we brought a travel high chair). There were plenty of things to make our stay comfortable (as described) in kitchen (utensils, cookware etc), washer/dryer, lots of towels/washcloths and kitchen towels, ALL the beach stuff we needed (inc floaties for toddler, toys, towels / cooler + ice packs were awesome). There is room for 2 cars in driveway. The ceiling fans kept us cool; AC in bedroom. We even BBQ'ed one night and enjoyed the grass in the front yard (for baby to chill). The street and neighborhood is quaint and feels safe. It is literally 3 houses away from the beach; we would take night strolls to the beach with the flashlights (provided). We used the outdoor shower to rinse off the sand. The bed and bedding were comfy and clean. There are lots of towels, beach towels and stuff. It is really nice to use the washer/dryer with the kids/beach etc. The vintage decor was a nice touch too. There is the public Beach Park literally in the backyard of the cottage. This is good in that we did go to the playground. Downside is that families go there early in the weekends, playing music and hanging there until sunset. Not partiers but just locals enjoying themselves. The cottage has typical island jalousie windows, so noise just comes through. The next door neighbors are friendly; they hangout until late, again not partying but chatting and enjoying themselves - it wasn't a major issue but we did hear them. The AC in the bedroom masks the noise at night but you can hear it from the bed that is loft style outside. Anyhow it is a very nice, local neighborhood and gets active early. The only issue we had was with the neighborhood noise, again from the vintage style jalousie windows. The kids weren't bothered (we use white noise from our phone for baby to sleep; AC kept the bedroom quiet). The noise was a bit of a bother on the weekend, with locals hanging at the park playing loud..."},{"_id":"208534443","date":{"$date":"2017-11-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4774436","reviewer_id":"89560033","reviewer_name":"Tomas","comments":"Skvělé místo, dům se specifickým duchem a stylem, hostitel perfektní"},{"_id":"217326224","date":{"$date":"2017-12-08T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4774436","reviewer_id":"149146210","reviewer_name":"Manuel Jr","comments":"The place was great..."},{"_id":"218441913","date":{"$date":"2017-12-12T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4774436","reviewer_id":"32491500","reviewer_name":"Greg","comments":"This Ewa Beach Cottage House is a great place to stay at cause it's a short walk to the beach, great in house amenities, outdoor patio furniture, BBQ and outdoor shower. \n\nI recommend this Ewa Beach Cottage House to vacationers if they want to stay away Honolulu and Waikiki cities and enjoy the country living and atmosphere during their Hawaii vacation."},{"_id":"219940321","date":{"$date":"2017-12-19T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4774436","reviewer_id":"138369350","reviewer_name":"JoLynn","comments":"The location was perfect for us.

We have had wonderful experiences at the other airbnb's we have stayed at, but Rebecca truly goes above and beyond to make sure her guests are happy and have everything needed.  We were literally a 2 minute walk from the private beach.  Seriously there was maybe a family out there when we went or no one but us most times.  I love not staying within the hustle and bustle of the touristy places, so if your wanting to experience the true Aloha of Hawaii, this is definitely the best place to be.  I did a lot of research before picking the cottage and one of my musts was having AC because a lot of the Airbnb's don't have AC, it was definitely a must on most days during the heat of the day. The kitchen was fully stocked with everything, even a cheese grater which I usually end up buying and leaving at AIRBNB's but I didn't have to she already had one.  Rebecca has all the extra's, boogie boards and when she knew we had 4 kiddos but there was only two there, she had two more delivered, by her amazing neighbors, Auntie Anne and her family.  She also has beach chairs, floats for the littles and a ton of sand toys.  This definitely saved us a lot of money. We have stayed at other places that didn't have these things and had to go buy them and it gets pretty costly.  I loved having the washer and dryer and she had a ton of towels as well as beach towels.  The shower has wonderful water pressure with a massaging head that worked wonders on my back.  The outdoor shower area also came in very handy.  We really enjoyed sitting outside at night enjoying the breeze and relaxing after busy days sight seeing, hiking, snorkeling, and all the other stuff we did. Also enjoyed hanging out with Auntie Anne and her family, we even got a private hula dance from Auntie Anne's sisters, it was amazing, they are wonderful.  I could go on and on, but I'm sure you are tired of reading so I will stop, but this is definitely the best place to stay and we will definitely be back.

Some of the most popular clubs and concert venues in Brooklyn are just blocks away. It's one block to Bedford avenue, and easy walking distance to many great restaurants and bars.  The Williamsburg bridge is three blocks away, and the L and J \u0026 M train stops are close by too.  Domino Park recently opened right on the river 2 blocks away, and it's a real treat at sunset.  There is no lack of places to visit, and things to do in our neighborhood. We keep finding more and more, and we'll let you know anything we discover.","notes":"- We are vegetarian, so if you cook in our kitchen, we ask that you not cook meat or fish. There are plenty of restaurants in the neighborhood to satisfy your meat eating needs. - Our little dog is shy, and at first she barks a bit. We do use a barking collar on her when you arrive, in order to minimize the barking. She is also hypo-allergenic, and does not shed hairs.  - Our building laundry not convenient to use. But right across the street is an excellent laundromat that is open till 21:30.","transit":"We are located equal distance to the Bedford L train stop, and the Marcy J \u0026 M train stop. You can get to the Lower East Side in only one stop. The Williamsburg Bridge entrance is only 4 blocks away by bike, and 3 blocks away by foot (separate pedestrian entrance). Two Citibike stations are located one block away, on Bedford and Wythe Avenues. If you have a car for some reason, you can park on the street for free, but you will have to observe alternate side parking rules or get a ticket. One block away is a brand new pay garage that you can also use.","access":"The guests have access to the bathroom, kitchen and the living room if we're not using it, but most of the time we are.","interaction":"It's fairly dependant on our schedules and the guests, but we usually just give our guests space to do their own thing, and sometimes we socialize if it seems appropriate.","house_rules":"No walking around in Shoes, we have guest slippers.","property_type":"Apartment","room_type":"Private room","bed_type":"Real Bed","minimum_nights":"2","maximum_nights":"7","cancellation_policy":"moderate","last_scraped":{"$date":"2019-03-06T05:00:00.000Z"},"calendar_last_scraped":{"$date":"2019-03-06T05:00:00.000Z"},"first_review":{"$date":"2014-09-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"last_review":{"$date":"2018-10-07T04:00:00.000Z"},"accommodates":2,"bedrooms":1,"beds":1,"number_of_reviews":32,"bathrooms":{"$numberDecimal":"1.0"},"amenities":["Internet","Wifi","Air conditioning","Kitchen","Paid parking off premises","Elevator","Free street parking","Buzzer/wireless intercom","Heating","Washer","Dryer","Essentials","Shampoo","Hangers","Hair dryer","Laptop friendly workspace","translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_49","translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_50","Private entrance","Hot water","Coffee maker","Refrigerator","Dishes and silverware","Cooking basics","Oven","Stove","Wide hallway clearance","Wide doorway","Other"],"price":{"$numberDecimal":"100.00"},"security_deposit":{"$numberDecimal":"200.00"},"cleaning_fee":{"$numberDecimal":"35.00"},"extra_people":{"$numberDecimal":"25.00"},"guests_included":{"$numberDecimal":"1"},"images":{"thumbnail_url":"","medium_url":"","picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/91288580/ef971f40_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","xl_picture_url":""},"host":{"host_id":"6465286","host_url":"https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/6465286","host_name":"Masha","host_location":"Los Angeles, California, United States","host_about":"We are a couple living in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, NY and we love traveling far and near.

Gave me a great orientation. Showed me the Fodors travel book they have. I could've talked to them all night.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PLACE\r\nDave kept saying the place was small, but big for Hong Kong, but honestly, for me as an American, I thought the space was perfect. In fact, more than I needed. The place is a 1bd 1bath. And actually with a sofa in the living room and a bunk bed, you could fit 2 people comfortably here and 3 people if you were on a budget. I actually spent most nights passing out on the sofa because I was so tired ... very nice, and long enough for my 5'10\"/178cm body! The sofa is also great for relaxing if you're traveling as a couple. Spacious, and you can pop in a DVD or connect your laptop w/ HDMI adapter and watch a movie.\r\n\r\nThe place itself was very well decorated and furnished. Iron, hangers, small fridge, cups, utensils, TV, can openers (I bought a lot of canned goods and beans from the grocery store several blocks toward jordan), 2 a/c units, and a little glass table that was a bit odd, but good enough for me to do work on my laptop with. \r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION\r\nLocation-wise, it's right in Kowloon on Nathan Road, so plenty of stores within the immediate area: 7-11, McDonalds (best deal ever: 23hkd for a chicken meal), athletic wear, a Mannings (cosmetics and sunscreen), the Temple Street market, and more. About 5 minutes walk away from Yau Ma Tei, exit C. About (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) minutes walk from Ladies Market. There was a lot of people-traffic on Nathan Road and those times reflect that. \r\n\r\n\r\nVALUE\r\nI got this place for a good price. Much better value than a hotel and far more utility and space than a hostel/inn. Even if you don't like this place, Dave has plenty of other good spots in Kowloon.

The studio is also clean and tidy, I can't remember not having a good night of sleep for the 5 weeks I spent in that studio. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is staying on the Kowloon side and wanted to visit the Hong Kong that's not always in the tour book."},{"_id":"179967373","date":{"$date":"2017-08-09T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4778098","reviewer_id":"47936102","reviewer_name":"Grace","comments":"nice room, very good location, prompt reply"},{"_id":"185903325","date":{"$date":"2017-08-23T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4778098","reviewer_id":"40642335","reviewer_name":"Jing Yuan","comments":"Great location, there're many restaurants around, the apartment small but clean , basic necessities are also offered ."},{"_id":"204826599","date":{"$date":"2017-10-20T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4778098","reviewer_id":"46907814","reviewer_name":"Yu","comments":"房源离机场快线很近的,但是附近没有地铁｡专线巴士能到热闹的地方,总体来说还算是方便的,就是小姑娘住的话,建议早点回家,因为周边的商店关的比较早｡整体很好,感谢DAVE的招待,房间很温馨"},{"_id":"205328628","date":{"$date":"2017-10-22T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4778098","reviewer_id":"26940897","reviewer_name":"Gideon","comments":"Dave was a fantastic host.

The size was fine - it's Hong Kong, after all! But the sheets and bedding weren't clean, the mattress was stained. There was someone else's hair on the sheets and pillows, and the bedding seemed old. Under the bed was atrociously dirty. \n\nSomeone had forgotten to flush the toilet, such that when I arrived, there was stale urine in it, and the room smelled like urine. \n\nThe ceiling was cracked with water damage, in a way that looked like there was still a moisture problem, and the light fixture as well as the shower fixture were both broken. The bathroom was grimy, and just kinda icky. What appeared to be someone else's blood was on the bathroom tiles, and in the tile grout. \n\nWhen I arrived, the deadbolt on the door was not working with the key; host said previous guests a few days ago had broken the lock. Only the flimsy door handle lock was working, which made me feel unsafe in the suite. Host offered to have the lock fixed, but phrased it in a way that made it clear he didn't want to have it fixed for me. I felt like a burden asking for something that I shouldn't have had to ask for. \n\nThe shampoo was empty. Only a mop was provided (not a broom) and the room got progressively dustier all week (air conditioning just does this in HK) but I couldn't clean it up. Two bath towels provided, which was a little light, and no face cloths and no extra blanket. \n\nAll in all, I wasn't happy with the suite. The price was good, and Dave seems to be a legitimately nice guy, but whoever he has cleaning the place is doing a bad job."},{"_id":"210987126","date":{"$date":"2017-11-12T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4778098","reviewer_id":"101956861","reviewer_name":"垚","comments":"挺好"},{"_id":"212677055","date":{"$date":"2017-11-19T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4778098","reviewer_id":"20779715","reviewer_name":"Jordan","comments":"Great space \u0026 location, Dave is extremely helpful."},{"_id":"216034999","date":{"$date":"2017-12-03T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4778098","reviewer_id":"8259999","reviewer_name":"Jason","comments":"I had a very comfortable stay at Dave's place.

The main bedroom has an AC unit that was nice because it was very warm and humid during our stay.  The neighborhood was quiet and the road in front of the house leads to a very nice park where you can watch sunrise and sunset.  The nicest feature of the Pineapple Shack is the counter/table for eating and/or socializing after a Hawaiian day out.  We did not use the top bunk bed in the secondary bedroom.  We opted to sleep in the sofa.  The top bunk bed is too close to the ceiling fan and we feel that it is hazardous to sleep in it especially when the ceiling fan is on (and it was on because it was hot)."},{"_id":"36367479","date":{"$date":"2015-06-28T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4778849","reviewer_id":"28884451","reviewer_name":"Josh","comments":"The house was clean, and we loved the location--a short walk to the end of the beautiful Laie Point, and very close to the Polynesian Cultural Center and to a shopping center.

Had everything (really everything) you could need or want, from snorkel gear to coffee filters. This saved us a lot of time and money (groceries are not cheap on the islands). Super kid friendly too: including a special toilet seat for kids, beach toys and spare diapers. We were there almost a week and could of easily stayed longer (or moved in).  location is great, close enough for trips to the amazing East and North shore.  If you've never been to the area, there is a lot to explore: tons of beautiful beaches, great farmers markets, food, history. never a dull moment (we downloaded a good driving tour app and Katie provides a great list of things to do).  If you don't feel like driving, there is a lovely and quiet beach, a stunning rocky point for watching the sunset, and strip mall with a grocery store, all a short walk away.  Neighborhood was quiet and charming.  the only negative I can think of is that the place is not impervious to bugs: saw a huge centipede close to the entry and a few cockroaches \u0026 flying termites made it inside after it rained.  I hear this is totally normal in Hawaii,  but the place isn't completely sealed (i.e. gaps under the doors) so it did cause a little anxiety.  The AC could be a better installed and the porch light was broken, but overall these things didn't negatively impact our visit and we still recommend it to anyone.   random tip:  if you are staying with a larger group there is another rental in the same house.  good for family reunions :)"},{"_id":"37741610","date":{"$date":"2015-07-10T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4778849","reviewer_id":"31810178","reviewer_name":"Angela","comments":"Wonderful experience!

We arrived at night after spending time in Waikiki, then spent a day at the PCC, one more night here, and moved on.  The beach is three doors down and is very child friendly.  My little two LOVED it.  My older son was wishing for stronger waves.  It's in a nice protected area of sand and sea.  There is grocery store literally on the corner, and not just a little convenience mart, but a real store.  That was nice.  \r\n\r\nThe Pineapple Shack had boogie boards, ironing board, outdoor shower, beach umbrella, pack-n-play (we didn't need it but saw it there), all items a family would need.

It is a close ten minutes or less drive to Kahuku though to get to a liquor store. Just a minor inconvenience. \nAs for the house, everything was fine. The bathroom tub isn't as updated as I hoped it would be but it served its purpose. Katie was a great host with easy communication; she had everything from beach chairs to rubbing alcohol.

Grocery store and great food is nearby. \r\n\r\nFour of us stayed for a week and we had everything we needed. The apartment was stocked with towels, extra blankets, and even beach gear! We had 2 cars which fit into the driveway. \r\n\r\nThe apartment is clean and cute. We thoroughly enjoyed the stay. One thing to keep in mind is that it does tend to get hot, and the sole air conditioner is in the double bed room. We kept the bedroom door open to help the cool air flow.

There also plenty of towels and snorkeling supplies that we can use.   The only one thing that kinda bothers me is that the wifi is kinda slow and there's no signals in the bedrooms.   Also the portable AC was only in one room, so the living room and the other room can be kinda hot during the heat waves.  We just leave all of the windows open, and the ventilation was pretty good actually.  Also there's laundry room with supplies in the back of the house, which is a great plus.

It's actually the spot where they filmed a section of Forgetting Sarah Marshall (where they jump off the cliff). The space is quite small, we had just us two - I probably wouldn't recommend a family of 6 staying! The main bedroom is also very small and can get quite stuffy - I would suggest keeping all the windows open. The bed in the main bedroom is very very very hard which was a bit of a bummer, we ended up sleeping on the pull out sofa because we just couldn't get any sleep on the bed.

We arrived late one night to a very clean well kept place. Entry by code is very convenient. The kitchen was well stocked with all the dishes and appliances you could need. There was a great stash of snorkel gear and beach towels as well. As is the case in island life, just after the lawn was mowed, there were a few more bugs inside than we wanted to deal with, and when we let Katie know, she immediately had pest control come spray for us. Also, when our son got into a fight with a Portuguese Man of War, Katie rushed over with oils and advice to help us get him through the ordeal. She is absolutely a five star hostess. The only reason we gave this home a four star rating was because we thought it was a single home, but it had three apartments within our building. Next door was a group of six to ten young adults who we shared the laundry and outdoor shower with. Although they were nice kids, we did not have full access to our back patio because they were out there drinking, smoking, and swearing and we had kids with us who were uncomfortable with that. There was also an issue of our hot water running out due to the number of people in the building (we are a family of five). We did ask Katie about the water and she immediately sent her husband out to adjust the hot water. If you have any concerns at all, just let Katie know and she will go out of her way to make your visit comfortable. We loved the location and the short walk to a great relaxing semi private beach!

This unit had every thing we needed, towels, beach toys for my little ones, wave boards for the older kids, an IRON (LOL), a rice cooker, comfortable couch and it was in the center of all our activities... PCC, Hukilau beach, Laie Point (which is literally right down the street from the house). The location is perfect to get away from all the tourists and busy traffic. Food Land was our best friend and provided breakfast, lunch and dinner for our entire family. Luckily when we were there it was very windy so we left our windows opened every night and felt a nice cool breeze as we slept. You could actually hear the ocean waves at night which was nice to sleep to. Pineapple Shack has everything you'll ever need to make your stay comfortable in paradise. We'll definitely be back!"},{"_id":"221206075","date":{"$date":"2017-12-25T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4778849","reviewer_id":"143612449","reviewer_name":"Carrie","comments":"Check in was easy.

Quiet neighborhood. It was perfect for us. We had spent some time in Honolulu prior to staying here, so our goal was just to see what the North Shore had to offer. It's a solid hour from Honolulu, so keep that in mind. The beach that is 3 doors down is excellent for toddlers (shallow/not any waves because of the reef)! Shopping center just a minute walk away.

We liked leaving a window or two open at night to feel and smell the ocean breeze and it was always quiet out. We were woken up each day by the roosters outside.\n\nWe would stay here again in a heartbeat. We walked to both Laie Point and Bikini Beach from the house.

The living room is very nice, you can watch TV and use the AC. The bedroom is quite comfortable, even if without a window it has powerful and silent fan that helps cooling the air.\r\nThe building is kind of crumbling and would probably need some renovation, and the nearby area (chinatown) is rather dirty and smelly.

She responded very fast to all messages and was upfront about everything, no surprises. We never actually met because she left town for labor day weekend, but never the less we were able to stay at her place no problem.  \r\n\r\nThe apartment was clean and organized, but needed some general maintenance. However the building was very old and some what dingy, with no elevator. She was very kind to leave the A/C on for us until we got there, but the apartment was way hotter then I expected. Maybe this is just me as I am used to much cooler temperatures and it being very hot in NYC that weekend. \r\n\r\nThe neighborhood is good during the day with lots of people out and about. It is very close to the Brooklyn bridge and little Italy which was convenient. However, this part of the lower east side / china town was not a smart place to be walking around late at night. Not the safest place after 12:00 / 1:00 am if your coming home late at night. Be sure to take a cab right to the front door instead of walking from either of the two closest metro/subway stops if it is late at night. Me and my girlfriend sensed it the one night we walked, as well as we were told the same thing by many NYC locals we met during our visit.  \r\n\r\nAll in all good weekend place to stay and a fair price for those on a budget.

I cannot imagine staying in a better location!\n\n2) The apartment is beautiful, spacious, and has everything you need! Beth went above and beyond to make sure we had additional amenities like snacks, toiletries, linens, and towels. We were incredibly comfortable and were even able to do laundry during our stay.\n\n3) Beth is an extremely attentive host and does everything she can to make her guests feel comfortable and prepared. She always responded immediately to my messages and accommodated our request for a late check-out. The building manager met us upon our arrival and helped us carry our bags to the apartment. He also gave us a tour and told us what we needed to know to fully utilize the space. \n\nIn summary, it was a five-star hotel experience!\n\nI truly cannot recommend staying here enough.

We enjoyed talking with her even if we didn't have enough time because of her schedule and our outings.\n\nI'd definitely recommend Katya's appartement. Easy to find and the location is just perfect. One block away from the subway station, 10-15min to Brooklyn bridge, 15-20 min to Manhattan, 25-30min to Times Square. You can even enjoy the beach in downtown Brooklyn which is called Coney Island. Only 20min... So many places to go in a few minutes ! \nAs described, the Caribbean style neighborhood is nice as well. A vibrant area you can enjoy with plenty of supermarkets, restaurants and shops. \nThe appartement is nice, cozy and clean. Just what we wanted. The room has enough space to put our stuff, fortunately there's an AC (by the time we were here, it was so hot in NY !). Nice bathroom and kitchen. But no microwave. However you can use the hot plate or just grab some food outside !\n\nTo conclud, a very nice stay ! Thank you Katya :)"},{"_id":"78834073","date":{"$date":"2016-06-09T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4790969","reviewer_id":"5652472","reviewer_name":"Rachel","comments":"The room is spacious, cosy and clean.

My goal is to have my footprints in all the countries in the world. (How big a goal it is!) I have been to Australia, the UK, Italy, France, Monaco, Holland, Hungary and Korea for travelling, and to the US, China, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Cambodia mainly for work. I lived in China, Thailand and Mexico for years and now living in my hometown Hong Kong. I enjoy every single moment travelling from one place to another. It's the best time for me to overlook the world and to empty my mind. It is said that the world is becoming smaller and smaller. We are on the southern hemisphere in the morning and appear on the northern in just some hours. The best way for me to feel home anywhere is to meet local people! I listen to their stories and learn their cultures, respect their traditions and share mine with them. This is what travelling means to me.\r\n\r\nThanks to Airbnb, it provides a platform for people to meet friends and look for accommodation at reasonable price. Star-rated hotels are great, but local hosts can give you warm welcome and make you feel home.\r\n\r\nI have years of experience hosting foreign guests through couhcsrufnig (CS), but stopped hosting since 2 years ago. After I returned from Mexico to Hong Kong in 2014 to start this hotel business, I found that airbnb is one of the best platforms which combines couhcsrufnig and business into one.

The three of us shared the family room and it was a little tight for three adults but for parents with a younger child this room would be perfect for over night accommodations.  Our trip to Hong Kong was last minute and we wanted to book two rooms at La Boutique for two nights but when only the family room was found available we decided it was more important to stay where we were comfortable, where we knew the property was very well looked after and we had an established and friendly relationship with our host Vincent. The glass enclosures for both the shower and the WC in close quarters was a little inhibiting but we are family!! We'll be back and hopefully we'll be able to book further in advance and find two rooms available for our next sojourn in Hong Kong☆☆ La Boutique is a new property and it is becoming a popular place to stay and with good reason☆☆"},{"_id":"27532376","date":{"$date":"2015-03-07T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4797773","reviewer_id":"25775260","reviewer_name":"Joyce","comments":"地理位置很好,而且楼下有好多吃的地方;房间干净舒适,而且老板和其他工作人员也非常的友善｡如果下次再来香港,还会选择这家旅舍｡"},{"_id":"27583119","date":{"$date":"2015-03-08T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4797773","reviewer_id":"25558950","reviewer_name":"Jack","comments":"Good experience,very comfortable and safety,where you can feel at home.

The location of the hotel is a bit shady at first, the building is old. But once you get inside the little lobby, it is quite homey. The room itself is a bit cramped with not much place to put in your luggages which may also be the case for other hotels in HK. The bed is comfortable and nice to sleep in after a tiring day. Location is good as it is a short walk to Austin station and a bit of a walk to Jordan station which is near the night market.

He also provided us some useful information like public transport and local food to eat around the neighbourhood. We are very thankful to have him as our host.\r\n\r\nThe room is described exactly the same as the photos and description. The room is very spacious for Hong Kong standard, and it is very clean and quiet with everything being close to perfect. The location of this room is reasonably near to MTR and it is easy to carry our baggage from the MTR to the accomodation as there is a slope to carry around so no physical lifting baggage is required. The accommodation is also equipped with modern lift and the security of the accommodation is very well too.\r\n\r\nI think this accommodation is one of my most well spent accommodation. Its a shame that we only managed to stay for a night. Will definitely come back again when I revisit HK anytime later, and will stay for a longer period too.

I booked with her because her and her boyfriend appeared to be friendly and provide a comfy living space, but my experience was to the contrary. Felix's communication skills as a host were not where I believe they should be. I didn't receive any messages until I contacted her, wasn't informed that she would be away from the apartment until a few hours before my arrival,  and received poor instructions regarding the location of the spare key (which lead to a drawn out process entering the apartment upon arrival).  When I later asked for her recommendations on places to visit in the city, she made no attempt to offer suggestions, instead directing me to look at a guidebook. \r\n\r\nThe apartment was lacking in terms of comfort and cleanliness. The room itself was fine, but the mattress was very hard. The room is adjacent to the kitchen where most of the social activity happens. Additionally, the walls are thin, which meant that I could clearly hear the neighbor's crying infant baby  at various points during my stay. The kitchen sink was stacked high with dirty dishes during most of my stay and  clothes were placed on the bathroom floor for extended periods of time. The hosts are cigarette smokers and the smell (which i am sensitive to) entered into the kitchen and my bedroom. \r\n\r\nOverall, I felt unwelcome in Felix and her boyfriend's home. I booked on short notice, but if my stay was too much of a burden, I would have preferred that she not accept my request, as there were several other great options in the area. \r\n\r\nOn the positive side, the apartment has interesting vintage decor throughout and is well situated in the city. The cats are really sweet. \r\n"},{"_id":"57189401","date":{"$date":"2015-12-22T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4802877","reviewer_id":"51744673","reviewer_name":"Benoit","comments":"J'ai passé chez Félix un séjour inoubliable !

It is nestled between Prospect Park and the historic Greenwood Cemetery, both of which are worth a visit. A city park is located directly next to the apartment and a full size grocery store is only a block away. Ft. Hamilton Parkway, which is one blocks to the north of us, has a number of great restaurants and coffee shops. We have also complied a short list of all our favorite neighborhood spots, which we have included on the backside of our welcome note inside the apartment and on our Air B\u0026B guidebook.  Other local points of interest include The Brooklyn Botanical Gardens, Brooklyn Museum, Sunset Park and Prospect Park Zoo -- all within walking distance from the apartment.","notes":"This rental is suitable for all types of visitors, however we feel it is particularly suited for families traveling with young children and tourists who are interested in exploring Brooklyn and Manhattan.  For those with walking disabilities, the apartment is all on one level, but guests do need to proceed down 4 stairs outside to gain entry to the downstairs unit.  The subway stop which is located just around the corner also has elevator access which most stops do not so if you are traveling with someone who needs assistance this is very convenient.  PLEASE NOTE that the rental may not be suitable for very tall people, as it is a garden level apartment. The ceiling height is around 78 inches throughout most of the space, but does dip down to around 72 inches in some places.  Our neighborhood is very quiet when compared to other neighborhoods in New York City, however please keep in mind that our apartment is still located within the city. Therefore there is a certain amount of urban n","transit":"The closest subway stop is the Church Ave (F/G) stop, which is located 1 block south and 1 block east of our address. The F train will take you directly into downtown Brooklyn in about 10-15 minutes and into lower Manhattan in about 25 minutes. Getting to Central Park, Union Square, Greenwich Village, The Lower East Side, SoHo, Madison Square Park, Washington Square Park, Chinatown, Rockefeller Center, Roosevelt Island, Bryant Park, The Empire State Building, and Times Square are all very easy, as all of these sites are within a few blocks of an F train stop.  The G train will take you north through Brooklyn, into Fort Greene, Clinton Hill, Williamsburg, Greenpoint, and on into Queens.  The B16 bus is also located directly across the street from the apartment which runs directly up the westside of Prospect Park, which will provide quicker transportation to Prospect Park, The Brooklyn Botanical Gardens, The Brooklyn Museum, Brooklyn Public Library, and Prospect Park Zoo.

Our amenities include a sampling of her goods, such as Anti-Yucky Spray for the bathroom and Clean \u0026 Green Hand Soap. When we are in town, we also curate a seasonal welcome basket at the beginning of the stay, which includes fresh fruit and breakfast items, to give our guests a little nosh when they first arrive.  I also own three restaurants and pubs in Manhattan and am more than happy to make a reservation for your group at any one of them. Should you be interested, the info on all of those businesses and Molly's businesses are all listed in our Air B\u0026B guidebook. Please do not hesitate to inquire.  As mentioned, the apartment has its own washer and dryer in the unit and features a full kitchen with gas range, microwave oven, dishwasher, garbage disposal, and full size refrigerator/freezer. Direct TV and wireless internet is also available. Laundry and dish","interaction":"The apartment is completely separate from the rest of the home, with its own private entrance to the front courtyard. Therefore, if guests are looking for total privacy, that is easily obtained.  There is a key pad on the door, which allows for keyless entry at anytime. This is also helpful for late check-ins. However, we live in the home just above the apartment and are very friendly! We are more than happy to greet travelers when they arrive and provide them with a short tour of the apartment. The choice is completely yours.","house_rules":"We expect our guests to behave like they would want guests to behave in their own house. Courteous and respectful. We would consider small pets, but please inquire in advance. Smoking is absolutely not permitted inside the apartment. Smoking is encouraged away from the house in general as we have small children. Please do not use the rear exit except in case of emergency as the area outside is under construction and unsafe to enter. We encourage our guests to remove footwear inside the apartment to ensure health and cleanliness, but it is not required. We do not allow parties or public events in our space since the potential for damage increases.  We can comfortably accommodate 6 guests, and potentially more.

They even provided a little table and chairs that our 3-year-old loved using to play and eat on. The description and pictures accurately describe the apartment.  It was so great to have the space of the two-bedroom apartment with a full kitchen for our family rather than being cramped in a small hotel.  The layout is fantastic with one bedroom at the front and the other in back with the kitchen/living room in between.  It provided a lot of privacy so that the baby in our room didn't wake up our 3-year-old in the other room (and vice versa).   Enjoyed the very plush towels! Fair amount of noise during the day from the park/playground directly next door (although we largely found the playground to provide a pleasant background noise ).  VERY quiet at night.  The neighborhood was fantastic.  Quiet and family orientated. One block to a nice grocery store.  Our 3-year-old enjoyed exploring the toys/books provided in the apartment and he loved the playground next door.   He was sad to leave \"our NYC apartment.\" We were somewhat worried about on-street parking but generally found it not be an issue. We twice got a spot directly across the street and twice had to spend a few minutes hunting for a spot.  But we never ended up more than a block away (and we were driving a minivan so had to pass up some smaller spots).  Also, the street out front doesn't have too much traffic so when necessary didn't seem to be a problem to double-park for a short time to unload and then find a spot to park.

Everything was as lovely as described, however, we felt the beds seemed a bit larger than a typical queen and double sized beds!  Both were very comfortable and we appreciated the choice of pillows with or without feathers.  With the temperatures rising in the summer, the fans were very welcomed and adequate and quiet. \r\nThe location couldn't have been more convenient to where we wanted to go visit family who lives in Brooklyn, and the close proximity the the subway was GREATLY APPRECIATED!  \r\nThe apartment was perfect for our family (Grandma,Grandpa, grown \"kids\" and preschool grandchild! )  \r\nDelicious restaurants reflecting the very diverse population of the Kensington area of Brooklyn and Aron's recommendations were right on!  (I don't remember if you recommended \"Sake\" for Japanese food, but it is close and I've been there a couple of times over the past 5 years and it is great!) \r\nImportant note to anyone who is sensitive to fragrances:  Aron DIDN'T USE fragrance room spray prior to our arrival!  This is GREAT as they make my daughter sick....plus it makes one wonder if the owner is trying to mask a bad odor!  It was clean and fresh.\r\nI can't say enough positive things about Aron and his family - they are delightful and I am hoping to see his girls grow over future visits to Brooklyn.  We will DEFINITELY contact Aron when traveling to Brooklyn again, and as you might guess, I would highly recommend Aron's place to whose looking for a place to stay in this area!

I was a little taken aback when we arrived. We'd just spent the week before in a very large spacious airbnb on 11 acres in Mass., and the fact that this place was in the basement with little light and low ceilings was a surprise. Kind of culture shock. But Molly happened to see us standing there, and welcomed us so warmly that we cheered right up. The key didn't work at first, but Aron ran right over with another one, and we went in. They had left homemade caramels to welcome us, and it was just so sweet! Once we realized how BROOKLYN, clean, and cozy the place was, it really added to our enjoyment of our visit right in the neighborhood where our son and his wife live! It was a quiet neighborhood, a great playground right next door, toys for our granddaughter which she loved, and easy walking distance to the subway! And from there, ALL OF NEW YORK CITY was within reach! The day we arrived we found a parking place right in front of the apartment! That was the last time.

There home is next to an elementary school and we were delighted to wake up during week days to the sounds of children playing on playground.\nTheir home is close to the subway. Grocery store, restaurants  and bars are close. \nThe apartment is very comfortable and quiet. Aron was very approachable and generous with any of our requests and questions.\nOur ride to airport on our last day did not come on time. Molly called a service they use and the driver was there in plenty of time. Molly and Aron are delightful. You will enjoy you experience and we will definitely stay with them again. You will enjoy yourselves.\n\nPam \u0026 Gary\n"},{"_id":"51728374","date":{"$date":"2015-10-24T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4807244","reviewer_id":"31199228","reviewer_name":"Jennife","comments":"what can we say ?\r\nfrom the minute we arrived after the  long 26 hour flight from Melbourne we were made to feel so welcome.\r\nthe little touches make this bnb even more special - the bowl of caramels that were on the table , the basket of goodies in the kitchen of eggs, bread etc meant we did not have to go out and find dinner on that first night. \r\nthis apartment is huge - it easily slept the 6 of us and the kitchen living room were roomy enough for the 6 of us ( 3 adults and 3 children) to move around easily.\r\n bathroom spotless, roomy shower, good water presuure , fluffy towels - aron and molly have obviously travelled heaps and know exactly what weary travelers need.\r\non top of all that they were so helpful in suggesting places to eat etc when asked.\r\n.\r\nthis is more than an apartment - its an opportunity to meet a great little family who are around when you need them but never intrusive. we hope to stay here again when we return in 6 months.\\thanks so much - we feel like we have made some new friends.x\r\nthis was our first airbnb experience - definitely the way to travel around the world\r\n"},{"_id":"51927918","date":{"$date":"2015-10-25T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4807244","reviewer_id":"43628357","reviewer_name":"Avery","comments":"Aron and Molly made us feel very welcome and were very helpful with information about restaurants and grocery stores.

Apartment is located in a nice part of Brooklyn about 15 mins walk from Prospect Park (worth visiting the Botanical Gardens in the park) and just 1 block from a subway station which is really handy for getting around. Subway station is right beside a decent sized supermarket. Basement apartment is done out very nicely (albeit in places the ceiling is a little low so may be a struggle for those over 6ft). All mod cons and very nicely decorated. Basic kitchen and bathroom supplies provided which was really good as well as things like washing up liquid and detergent for the washing machine. The welcome basket was also a lovely touch. The only downside was the noise from the young children upstairs. There seems to be very little sound proofing between the apartment and the house above (and I think probably Aron and Molly's house has wooden floors) which means that when the toddlers are running about and getting excited, you can hear it, and at times it can be quite loud. These are the things that young kids do (we know as we go on holiday with our hordes of young nephews and nieces regularly), so we did not complain, to do so would be unfair as its not the kids fault. It did mean however that unless you are very sound sleeper you are woken on the early side each morning and/or if you are staying in (which to be fair few people do when you are visiting New York) then it can be a little frustrating. Am sad to have to give this negative feedback as otherwise it's a lovely apartment."},{"_id":"73691407","date":{"$date":"2016-05-09T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4807244","reviewer_id":"15359249","reviewer_name":"Selina","comments":"Aron is a great host!

An example of Aron’s great hospitality was when we had asked if there was a basketball we could borrow to use on the nearby courts. Although Aron informed that he didn’t have a basketball we came home to find a brand new basketball that he had purchased for us to use during our stay.

The host lives upstairs and has children who start doing \"children stuff\" at about AM.  We get up early but if you are a late sleeper, you might consider a different unit. Just something to keep in mind.\n\nThe subway is a little further away than we expected and the lines running to Manhattan from there require changes.

He was really thoughtful and offered a white noise machine for our little kids. There were a nice selection of toys and games available as well as some movies. The kitchen was well stocked with the basics. The comments about the height of the ceiling as well as there sometimes being noise from above are true although the noise started at maybe 8:30 or so when we were already up. The ceiling didn't bother my husband or me (5'9\" and 5'11\") but agreed that you should think about whether it'll bother you before booking! We hope to come back another time when the weather is nicer and we can explore Prospect Park and other Brooklyn destinations!"}]}

Favorite part was the old, old house, immaculately clean yet pleasantly worn, which much reminded me of London. In short, I cannot say enough positive things about the \"BBB!\""},{"_id":"3421650","date":{"$date":"2013-01-27T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"482765","reviewer_id":"4622353","reviewer_name":"Nur","comments":"We had a very enjoyable stay at Megan and Jason's place. They were helpful when needed and discrete in sharing their apartment. Their two friendly dogs Frank and Bean were equally respectful and stayed calm most of the time. Their lovely  Brooklyn Brownstone is just a few steps away from the Brooklyn Academy of Music and equally close to several subway lines. So it is mostly a one-stop ride to anywhere in Manhattan and also other places of interest in Brooklyn and Queens. The guest room is spacious and tastefully decorated. The bed is very comfortable. In brief, what you see is what you get and we would readily repeat this experience which allowed us to find peace and rest in a cosy atmosphere while visiting the bustling concrete jungle.

Their home looked as described in the photos and was warm, cosy and clean. Most importantly, it had a working shower with very decent water pressure. We had to share the common bath with them but scheduling wasn't a problem at all. The house is also beautifully decorated with lots of lovely knick-knacks that really capture Jason and Megan's quirky style and offers lots of photo ops. \n\nThe subway is a short walk away and there are lots of convenience stores and eateries nearby. The neighbourhood is quiet and feels really safe even at night. They also left us a useful print-out of places to eat nearby. Really useful and thoughtful. \n\nMegan and Jason weren't around when we checked in but we were warmly greeted at the top of the stairs by their four-legged welcome crew, Frank and Bean. Real sweethearts. Never met such calm pooches before. You'll almost never hear them and there's no offensive doggy smell either. \n\nWe'd certainly return to Jason and Megan's if we ever visit NYC again. Gorgeous home, friendly couple and wonderful dogs.

It is large, clean and very comfortable - quiet too. They provide dresser space and hanging space for your clothes so you can properly settle in. The kitchen is small but has all you'll need for making breakfast, etc. Oh, and they have a fantastic shower.\r\n\r\nThe location within Brooklyn could hardly be bettered, with many different subway lines all within a few minutes' easy walk, including fast lines into Manhattan and to JFK airport. The local area of Fort Greene is an excellent mix of original Brooklyn and some gentrification, making it feel like exactly the right level of 'authentic experience'. Not too full of hipsters but also very safe and serene. There were plenty of good cafes, restaurants and shops nearby for all my needs. Megan and Jason provided a list of their favourites - which was handy for my first foray out when I arrived rather tired from the flight.\r\n\r\nMegan was very helpful and friendly by email in the run up to my visit. I had a few queries about some arrangements and she answered them all speedily. I found I was a little chilly on my first night so asked for another blanket and it was provided straight away. During my stay, I bumped into both Megan and Jason almost every day and we would have a quick friendly chat. I felt like I was at home, but was also completely independent. Their dogs are friendly but mainly keep to the other room, so there wasn't any overwhelming dogginess (or any doggy smells at all!) That said, if you don't like dogs or have any allergies to animal hairs you should think twice.\r\n\r\nOverall, this is a lovely room with delightful hosts in a great location.

Especially helpful to be one stop away from Atlantic Terminal, which is where you can take the LIRR to/from Jamaica Station (for Air Train to JFK Airport). DeKalb Ave Station is only one stop away from Manhattan, so it's really quick to get in and out. \r\n\r\nThere are numerous food options in the area. We especially loved La Bagel Delight on Lafayette for breakfast (poppy seed bagels are delish!). Unfortunately, I got food poisoning after eating at 67 Burger (although my partner was fine), so be warned.\r\n\r\nOur room was spacious, airy and quiet (except when there was a dinner party in the backyard), and the charming old brownstone is tastefully decorated with little curios in unexpected places. Megan and Jason are a laid-back, easy-going couple. Arranging logistics with them was seamless and we had no trouble at all with check in/out and any queries, even though we hardly saw them. Frank and Bean are adorable and we missed having them around when they went on holiday over the weekend with their owners."},{"_id":"5228183","date":{"$date":"2013-06-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"482765","reviewer_id":"3405594","reviewer_name":"Sara","comments":"This is the perfect place where we stay when visiting our grandbabies, who live just across the street.

Better yet, the room faces a back garden, meaning it's very quiet all the time. We slept very well there.\r\nThe location is also very convenient, close to many subway stations that between then seems to serve every line in New York. Just to have an idea, in the five days we were there we never had to make a connection - there was always a line that would take us exactly where we wanted to be. I doubt that any location in Manhattan would be so convenient.\r\nLast but not least, the apartment comes equipped with the most adorable dogs ever. We loved Frank and Beans, and sometimes we almost wished we could stay the whole day in the apartment just so we could play with them.

The place came with all the amenities one may need. The room is very cute and BIG, vintage-like with a modern twist. I just loved that we stayed in an almost 100 year old place. You all you need: iron, dresser, side table, TV, hairdryer, towels, wifi, etc. We only really needed a place to sleep and whereas it may be a bit strange to be in someone's home, it didn't feel like that because there of the way this 3-story place is built and the hosts give you plenty of privacy.

Great wifi service and Sonos as well. Also very good air conditioning in each bedroom. \r\n\r\nThat all said, the apartment in real life does not look nearly as nice as it does in the photos. Each bathroom is a hodgepodge of different plumbing fixtures. One shower has the boiler controls in the wall inside the shower.  Water in the front unit (with balcony) ran hot and cold which made showering interesting.  Also a toilet in one of the front bedrooms has an electric pump to help it flush.  This is fine, except it also had a water leak from the tank to the bowl so the pump was activated every few minutes and the noise made sleeping in the bedroom impossible. The whole place could use a professional paint job.

The breakfast was also amazing - delivered freshly made to our door and prepared in our kitchenThe penthouse  is even better as it appears on the website and what a location, we were right on the Beach of Ipanema, steps away from our now new favorite brazilian restaurant Garota de Ipanema where I tasted one of the best steaks I ever had.\r\n\r\nThe only thing we missed was the nice weather during our stay as we came during a rainy week, however  we were able to watch movies in the living space on a projector screen which was pretty awesome!  There is a supermarket, bank, taxis, restaurants, metro station, ATM’s, Starbucks, Bar, and fast foods less than 5 minutes walk away and you must try ‘Polis Sucos’ just around the corner for the best fruit juices and Acai .\r\nThe other feedback is just to be clear about your expectations from the staff, they are happy to be working around your wishes and be present or absent depending on how you would like and plan your holiday, and it also comes down to the language barrier so just let Alex know what you would like when you arrive if you do not speak portuguese.

After several years of Asian living, we are currently located in the Middle East  (so we really enjoy the tropical lushness of Hawaii!). When we are on our downtime, we are either checking off our \"bucket list\" of worldwide places to explore, visiting family in New England or relaxing in the Big Island's embrace, where we enjoy the Aloha spirit and much of the Hawaiian culture. While Hawaii can bring many exciting experiences, being in Hawaii gives us a peaceful, relaxing and rejuvenating feeling that few other places in the world can offer, and our villa also adds the feel of Balinese serenity.\r\n\r\nThe Big Island has a special place in our hearts, as this was where we were married. This is the place that makes us the happiest, so we decided to finally own a piece of this paradise. We want a place to come home to and to call our very own.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, we are sharing this home now with our family, our friends and our guests. \r\n\r\nWe enjoy our visits to our villa.

She is welcoming and gracious, and speedily replied to any questions that I had. Even the resort management were prompt and courteous in their response to a request that I had. \r\n\r\nThe unit itself was very large - large enough to accommodate two couples with a child apiece. Also, it does come with a single car enclosed garage, so parking is not an issue. The soaring ceilings and comfy furniture (good stuff, not your typical cheap hotel furniture) are perfect for coaxing you into laying around and relaxing rather than heading out for activities. The whole place - from the appliances to the decor - just exudes a feeling of luxury and class that you rarely get in the typical vacation rental. I've definitely paid a lot more for a lot less. The outdoor grill and patio are so great for cooking, dining and post-meal lounging that we ended up just sticking around there for most meals rather than eating out. \r\n\r\nThe resort grounds are very well maintained, and the pool area included a large kiddie pool that was only about 1 foot deep - perfect for our little ones. After experiencing the nonstop crushing crowds everywhere you go on Oahu, it was surprising how quiet and uncrowded this place was - even on a spring break week. If pools and jacuzzis aren't your thing, a few minutes drive gets you to the Mauna Lani beach club. There are lots of cabanas and lounge chairs to use, but get there early as the cabanas were full by 9am and the chairs by 10am. The condo also comes with plenty of beach chairs, so you can always bring those and skip the cabana hunt. The snorkeling was superb, and there are many beautiful paths meandering along the waterfront. Up and to the left were a few benches along the golf course for whale watching, while to the right were fishponds and several spots with lounge chairs tucked under palm trees. I highly recommend grabbing a book and a drink and hunting down one of these spots.\r\n\r\nLastly, the golf course. We played Mauna Lani South, and it was a good as advertised. The course is in great shape, and the views are stunning enough to help you forget all the balls you left in the lava rocks. \r\n\r\nI highly recommend this place, and we will be coming back!"},{"_id":"30670284","date":{"$date":"2015-04-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4840020","reviewer_id":"27571001","reviewer_name":"Elysia","comments":"Wow what a beautiful place to stay! immaculate both inside \u0026 out with everything we needed to make us feel at home.

Everything was beautifully presented with lovely artwork and comfortable furniture.\r\n\r\nAnna was very helpful and easy to communicate with and always responded to emails quickly. She was very kind in leaving us a welcome gift to collect at the local supermarket. \r\n\r\nIf you stay here, make the most of the beautiful private club beach which has fabulous snorkelling. Having a car park pass and entry to this is a huge plus to the condo. There are other nearby beaches that are truly beautiful - e.g. Mauna Kea and Hapuna. We were particularly taken with the south (left hand) end of Mauna Kea beach which you can drive down to after requesting public parking at the resort entrance. It is a short walk downhill from the carpark to the beautiful beach.\r\n\r\nThere are local stores within the Mauna Lani complex including a small supermarket which has most of what you will need. If you require a big shop, there is a larger supermarket at Waikoloa Village about six miles away (inland - left off the main highway and not at the Waikoloa Beach). There are also plenty of places to eat around Mauna Lani and Waikoloa, although many of these were pricey for us Kiwis with a very week NZ dollar currently. Not so for people from the US.\r\n\r\nThe whole Kohala coast area is fabulous with lots to see and do. You will need a car.\r\n\r\nI highly recommend staying at Anna's 2BR Luxury Golf Resort Townhouse. I would return in a heartbeat.

The lanai is lush and private, and there's a settee out there that was my go-to place for reading, napping, sitting with my husband and a glass of wine way into the night.

Siempre estuvo atenta a nuestras peticiones lo que hizo mucho más agradable nuestra estancia en su casa. Cuando llegamos a casa, teníamos un regalo de bienvenida que nos gustó mucho.\r\n\r\nLa casa es como se muestra en las fotos, muy espaciosa, con todo lo necesario para unas vacaciones como en casa.\r\n\r\nLa casa esta dentro de una urbanización privada, con muchas áreas verdes, club privado(hay que ir en coche), piscina, vigilancia, etc. Aunque la isla es un destino de excursiones y playa, la casa tiene todas las prestaciones para descansar por las noches o disfrutar relajado los días que no se quiere salir de casa.\r\n\r\nEsta muy cerca del aeropuerto de Kona, con un coche de alquiler es muy fácil acceder. Hay un centro comercial al aire libre(con supermercado) unos cuantos metros antes de llegar a casa, se puede comprar comida ya preparada, muy práctico cuando se ha estado todo el día fuera.\r\n\r\nA pesar de lo bien que lo pasamos en la casa y de las atenciones de Anna, sucedió un incidente que ya hemos trasladado a Anna, la chica de la limpieza(Sra. Teresa) llegó a las 10:00 en punto, que dejáramos la casa ya que debía limpiar, no accedió a limpiar si no nos íbamos de la casa de inmediato. Tuvimos que salir corriendo de la casa ya que estaba enfadada, también nos llamó el servicio de vigilancia de la urbanización diciendo que debíamos dejar las instalaciones de inmediato o nos iban a cobrar una penalización por no salir a nuestra hora. Tuvimos que salir corriendo \"literalmente\" y estacionar en la calle para calmarnos del disgusto y relajarnos ya que incluso llegamos a pensar que podían llamar a la policía...fue muy desagradable. Lamento este incidente porque Anna es una anfitriona fantástica, pero creo que debe corregir el sistema de check out.\r\n\r\n Un saludo,\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"_id":"51317985","date":{"$date":"2015-10-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4840020","reviewer_id":"2608355","reviewer_name":"Steve","comments":"Very nice place to stay.

It is a private townhouse, large, 20 ft ceilings in the living area, two large bedrooms and a pullout bed in the living room, and as the pictures show is very well decorated.  Simply put, it is just fun to hang out in when away from activities (which was great for Christmas!).  It also has a beautiful patio that we used every evening for dinner.  For us, the private access to the beach was perfect:  you could either drive or bike there (ca. 1.5 miles), which we did nearly every day, and not have to worry about beach chairs:  just bring a towel and snorkeling gear.  On a side note, we stayed in several parts of the island, and found this area the best for our family:  it has most of the best beaches (e.g. Hapuna), lots of sun, and access to the rest.

Ну, а Анна и Рассел - лучшие хозяева. Нам не довелось встретиться, но их поддержка ощущалась всегда. И при этом было очень, очень приятно получить сюрприз от Анны - подарочную карту в ближайший супермаркет. Впрочем, все по порядку.\r\nДом большой, просторный, хорошей высоты потолки, в нем легко дышится, в нем есть всё, и это всё - работает и функционирует по высшему разряду. Для особо интересующихся - целая папка инструкций по использованию имеющегося оборудования.\r\nПостели удобные, подушек - пол-шкафа разных на выбор.\r\nСвой гараж, пляжные кресла, даже \"макаронина\" для снорклинга. Ну вообще все идеально. Пожалуй, маловата частная территория самого дома - но мы практически не видели и не слышали соседей. До ближайшей плазы - на машине минут 5, пешком (по Гуглю) минут сорок. На плазе - мелкие магазинчики и супермаркет, в котором есть все необходимое. Подарочную карту от Анны мы с удовольствием потратили на вино, и с тем же удовольствием употребили его за здоровье Анны и Рассела.\r\nЗападная часть острова, где расположена Mauna Lani, поначалу производит удручающее впечатление - ни клочка естественной зелени, только черно-коричневая корка лавы, через которую едва пробивается ковыль. Тем больше начинаешь ценить рукотворную красоту зеленых садов. Зато дождей в этой части острова практически не бывает. Все восточное побережье острова - пышет зеленью. Это понятно, потому что очень редкий день там обходится без дождей, да и попрохладнее там. Осмотреть остров лучше всего при воздушной прогулке - на вертолетах (ближайшая площадка - около ближайшего к Mauna Lani светофора, напротив соседней плазы) или маленьких самолетах типа Cessna (водятся в аэропорту). Ну, и самое яркое впечатление - вулканическая жизнь острова, поэтому парк вулканов для посещения строго обязателен. \r\nОбщее впечатление от отдыха - замечательное место, где живешь в комфорте, где можно не вылезать из воды, наблюдая за рыбками и крабиками, и где есть, куда пойти, помимо пляжа. Очень здорово!\r\n"},{"_id":"111323269","date":{"$date":"2016-10-30T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4840020","reviewer_id":"6435421","reviewer_name":"Roy","comments":"staying here was awesome, very comfortable and owners communicated well "},{"_id":"112674472","date":{"$date":"2016-11-06T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4840020","reviewer_id":"57801811","reviewer_name":"Donna","comments":"Great communication, house is perfect in every way\"\""},{"_id":"113313163","date":{"$date":"2016-11-12T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4840020","reviewer_id":"57746290","reviewer_name":"Tim","comments":"What a lovely stay and a beautiful and comfortable home.

The place was close to the fairmont where we needed to be for a wedding but a car was needed to reach other areas for touring.  Foodland farms was close and was very convenient for grocery needs. One suggestion for future guests is that they were very strict with outdoor noise. We were playing music on the provided cd player outside and got a noise complaint at 5pm which to me is a reasonable hour for music.  For family vacation this spot is perfect though.

The area is quiet and beautiful. The pool is a short walk and never crowded. I love having access to the Beach Club area. It was a short drive but parking was easy. At the Beach Club there were covered and uncovered lounges chairs available and we were able to get them without difficulty every morning. The food at the Napua Beach Club was good and the Foodland Farms had sandwiches and snacks available for us to put in our little cooler. Snorkeling is nice off the beach in front of the Beach Cub also. Visibility was excellent especially in the morning. The house decor was very calming and the beds were very comfortable. It was nice having 2 bathrooms. My favorite spot was the outside couch. I loved sitting outside on it in the morning and the evening when we were not at the beach. I am so glad we chose to stay at Anna and Russell's.

Hosting through Airbnb has allowed me to to do both.  \r\n\r\nOn my free time I like spend time with family and friends, travel and read - biographies and art are my favorite topics,   I also love history, interior decoration and photography.  Lately I have had a growing interest in reading about natural food and natural healing through meditation and yoga.  So I have been spending a lot of time cooking and attending to my herb garden.\r\n\r\nI have lived most of my life in Rio. so I know the city well.   Since the 80´s, when I came back from a small liberal arts college in the US where I majored in History and Political Science, I started hosting friends vacationing  in Rio.  I have started hosting visitors from college  every year.   Some were coming for the first time, others came every other year.

Large, bright, clean, well-equipped, and just great for families with children. It's a beautiful living space with comfortable bedrooms and a large living room. The penthouse terrace is lovely and allows for impressive views over the water at Copacobana and Ipanema. \r\nThe best thing about this flat, however, is its location, which is just perfect for holidaymakers. It is 5 minutes to Copacabana beach and 5 minutes to Ipanema beach (by foot). There are loads of good restaurants within a stone's throw, several supermarkets, a metro station (Gen. Osorio) and plenty of shops. Being this close to the beaches, with easy access to the rest of the city (taxis available everywhere), was perfect for us.\r\nCelia is a gracious, helpful and generous host and I can't rate her highly enough! She went well out of her way to make our stay special and those extra touches were really appreciated (especially the leftover carnaval costumes!) (oh yeah, and the delicious mountain cheese). She was very helpful when we arrived, and made herself constantly available to us during our stay if we needed anything. She had plenty of good tips for restaurants and other activities in the neighbourhood. \r\nOverall, a hugely positive experience for me.

Highly recommended!\r\n\r\nI booked this apartment last-minute.  Celia responded extremely quickly, approving my request.  After my booking was accepted, Celia was very communicative regarding the arrival of my friend and me to ensure she would be there to greet us.  Unfortunately, I missed my flight to Rio but Celia took this in stride and made sure to meet my friend after seeking pertinent details about him.  \r\n\r\nOnce I arrived, I found an apartment that is beautiful, comfortable, well appointed, eclectically and artistically decorated, full of natural light, and centrally located between Copacabana and Ipanema.  The building feels secure with 24-hour doormen and is on a busy street.  The location is convenient to the beach, many restaurants, and markets.  The internet was fast and reliable.  The air-conditioning, appliances, and fixtures are all new and work well. \r\n\r\nCelia is a wonderful and warm person who handled an unusual situation with grace and aplomb.  Unfortunately, my flight leaving Rio was canceled after I checked out of Celia's home.  With no cell phone signal and non-existant wifi at Santos Dumont airport, my best solution was to go back to Celia's apartment hoping to rent it for another night.  Unfortunately, Celia and her family had moved back into the space making it unavailable to me.  Celia was very understanding of my situation and was helpful in finding a new accommodation for the evening.  Although I felt like I was intruding, Celia (and her daughter their pet dachshund) understood the necessity of my coming back could not have been more warm and kind.  \r\n\r\nI would highly recommend renting this apartment and hope I am welcome to do so again.   Celia speaks excellent English and is a very interesting person who I sincerely hope to meet again."},{"_id":"57531365","date":{"$date":"2015-12-27T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"484267","reviewer_id":"9937274","reviewer_name":"Sonia","comments":"We spent a fantastic time at Celia and Ze's appartement; everything is perfect; it is clean, the location is good, there is AC which is important in Rio, the rooms are quiet (which is very rare in Rio!) the bathrooms are clean, well equipped and comfortable, and the terrasse is a big plus; we will come back for sure!!!

The apartment is clean, spacious and as seen in the photos. The beds and pillows are comfortable and clean. The showers are spacious (unlike many Rio apartments) A bonus is the tranquility of the balcony during the day or night. We often slept with the windows open, and left them open most of the day. Traffic noise was almost non-existent. I suggest not using the A/C for those not accustomed to the Rio heat, the temperature changes will only make you sick. Although I've traveled to Rio many times before and am very familiar with the area, Celia was still able to suggest different places for us to try.

A gigantic collection of books and movies, along with cool decorations.  If Ernest Hemingway had been a Carioca, this is what his apartment would look like :)   \r\n\r\nCelia was great.  I booked this apartment the day before I needed it, and only for a 2 day stay.  She met me there when I arrived, and went over everything.  I've been to Rio a lot so I know my way around, but if this is your first trip, this is the host to point you in the right direction.  I didn't really need anything from her during the stay, but she is in the same building and was responsive to all messages.  Check out was a breeze and she got the contact info of my Brazilian friend in case I forgot anything.  Really went the extra mile (or kilometer haha)\r\n\r\nAs she says in the listing, the building itself is from the 70s.  Compared to US standards, all apartment buildings in Zona Sul seem outdated and this one is no exception.  The building and apartment have quirks which obviously come with the territory.  Elevators are slow and you have to walk a few steps.  There were some issues with the AC working in the living room but it was a temporary problem that I'm sure future renters won't have.  Nothing negative or deal-breaking, but if you are the type that expects new, modern, and pristine, this isn't the place for you.  If you like vintage and eccentric, this is definitely the place.  There is also a giant outdoor patio.  Rio is meant to be explored but I will admit my days got started later than normal as I enjoyed laying around so much.  And when it was raining outside, being cooped up in here was perfection.  Kitchen has about every single cooking implement imaginable, preparing a meal here would be easy.\r\n\r\nThe doormen were great and even during my short stay, the ones I hadn't met asked for my name.  Celia gives you a list of their names also, and its obvious these are real doormen, not the standard fare of guys sitting there watching tv.  Location is great and is a couple of blocks away from grocery stores, restaurants etc, not to mention Copacabana and Ipanema 2 blocks in either direction.  There are tons of apartments on airbnb that have similar looks and pricing.  If you want something unique for a great price, I highly recommend this apartment and host!"},{"_id":"124254906","date":{"$date":"2017-01-01T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"484267","reviewer_id":"81383874","reviewer_name":"Christophe","comments":"Nous avons particulièrement apprécié d'une part le Penthouse de Célia parfaitement équipé, confortable, situé à moins de 5 minutes à pieds des plage de Copacabana et Ipanema et d'autre part du parfait fonctionnement des climatiseurs présents dans chaque pièce."},{"_id":"125956435","date":{"$date":"2017-01-08T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"484267","reviewer_id":"98827110","reviewer_name":"Patricia","comments":"A casa e a proprietária são ótimas.

Alicia is a great host and gave us lots of useful information and recommendations when we arrived and would have been available in the house, if we would have needed help. You reach the indeed cozy studio on the top floor with the elevator. A highlight is the terrace with a view of the Sagrada familia. You have access to the terrace via the staircase, but use it exclusively (at least we never met anyone). Ideal for a breakfast in the morning sun! The bed is just like described and shown on the photo and works for two people. The Wifi worked, but don't expect the fastest and most stable connection. For our purposes it worked fine. The kitchen has everything you need for a small cooking session, though we never used it for this. A plus was that Alicia provided tea, coffee, milk and biscuits already. The bathroom is very small and does not have a separate sink. You also need to put the boiler on an hour before the shower, if you want hot water, which was not a problem for us. \r\nIn general, we enjoyed our stay.

Хозяйка квартиры, Алисия, очень доброжелательная и общительная: отвечала на все наши многочисленные вопросы, очень помогла при возникших трудностях с покупкой билетов на футбольный матч (ходила с нами в банк, связывалась со службой поддержки).\r\nВ квартире есть все самое необходимое - 2 одноместные кровати, шкаф для одежды, кондиционер, холодильник, чайник и кофемашина (чай, кофе и сахар тоже есть), посуда и магнитофон, электрическая плитка (мы ей не пользовались). Вид с террасы на Саграда Фамилия очень впечатляет. На террасе есть лежаки, стол и стулья.

The flat is located very central, but inside you almost didn't even hear the bells of the sagrada familia or any traffic noise. \n\nAlicia was really, really kind and even offered us to pick us up at the airport.

El estudio es tal cual se presenta en el portal de airbnb, no exagera virtudes ni disimula defectos. Viajé a Barcelona solo, me alojé algo más de un mes y por cuestiones laborales muchos días tuve que pasar horas en casa trabajando, siempre me sentí cómodo, sobre todo por la agradable luminosidad y por la amplia y hermosa terraza que balconea sobre la mismísima Sagrada Familia de Gaudí.\r\nEs un estudio austero pero confortable que respondió perfectamente a mis expectativas y objetivos. Su ubicación es muy buena, muy bien comunicado con autobuses y metro aunque casi todas mis idas y venidas al Eixample, a los barrios del casco histórico o a Gràcia los hice caminando porque es la mejor manera de disfrutar de Barcelona y porque son trayectos que no superan los veinticinco o treinta minutos de paseo.\r\nEn las inmediaciones del Cozy Sunny Studio hay multitud de bares, restaurantes de todo tipo y comercios de alimentación, lo que hace muy cómoda la vida cotidiana.\r\nComo anfitriones Alicia Busquets y su familia son espectaculares. Siempre dispuestos a solucionar cualquier problema que pueda surgir, a asesorar al huésped en aquello que pudiera necesitar, a brindar atención y hospitalidad. Su hermana Mayte y su sobrino ( el Gran Charly, experto informático ) me sacaron de más de un apuro producido por mi natural torpeza durante mis primeros días en el Cozy Sunny Studio.\r\nPara redondear mi percepción de la calidad como anfitriones de Alicia y su familia bastará decir que mi almuerzo de despedida de Barcelona - horas antes de abordar el vuelo de regreso -  lo disfruté en su casa en compañía de unas amigas suyas y de su simpático padre. Nos zampamos unas exquisitas empanadas santiagueñas hechas magistralmente por Liliana, una argentina de ley curiosa de las actividades artísticas y de las manifestaciones culturales de Catalunya.\r\n¿ Se puede pedir más ?\r\n"},{"_id":"14388567","date":{"$date":"2014-06-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"484390","reviewer_id":"12525732","reviewer_name":"Rodriguez","comments":"Amazing location and neighbourhood.

Neither did she later in the evening.  Or the next day. Alicia did not answer us or call us back. It seemed she just did not care.\r\nSo we stayed in a hotel near Sagrada Familia with a beautiful terrace - which was very much different from the so called terrace of the studio (it was very dirty and not so nice as in the photo).\r\n\r\nI find this situation very unpleasant. Maybe this flat is ok for some people  (and the location is good) - but pictures should reflect the real situation. In reality it is tiny and everything looks like  second-hand stuff.\r\n\r\n"},{"_id":"16338032","date":{"$date":"2014-07-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"484390","reviewer_id":"4490321","reviewer_name":"Hajnalka","comments":"We stayed in the apartment a bit longer than a week and it was amazing. Alicia was a lovely host. The flat was simply brilliant. Although small, it is nicely furnished and absolutely cosy. The highlight of the flat is perhaps the AC. After a long hot day at the beach we could hardly wait to get back to the nicely cool apartment. \r\n\r\nThe apartment is very well situated. It is near the metro station, so you can reach all the sights by public transport. The beach is also only a short metro-ride away. Sagrada Familia is just round the corner. And now comes the most brilliant part: you can see this spectacular church every single day from the terrace. Despite the \"touristy\" location, the house is very safe and Alicia makes sure that it also stays safe. \r\n\r\nThere are plenty of nice restaurants just rund the block. You will find Spanish and Italian cuisine, several fast food restaurants and snack bars. There are also nice places where you can get a cold mojito or sangria. If you'd rather cook your own meals, there are plenty of small shops where you can buy your daily essentials, fresh fruits, veggies, or spanish specialities. The kitchen is equipped with everything you could possibly need (even a hand blender for making fresh smoothies if you wish). \r\n\r\nTo sum it up in a nutshell, if you're looking for a great stay in Barcelona and an awesome location, you definitelly should book this flat!

Tiempo: 77 noches. Asunto: por trabajo. Cuando llegué era de noche, y aparentemente no había mucha suciedad, aunque algunas manchas en las paredes y muebles se veían. A la mañana siguiente, cuando a la luz del día pude ver todo mejor, me encontré con mucha suciedad. Al recibirme Alicia, me dijo que si veía algo, que se lo comentase, puesto que el inquilino anterior había dejado todo \"asqueroso\" y que su sobrino había limpiado, pero que no era el habitual en hacerlo. Pues bien, los muebles de la cocina tenían una cantidad de moho, polvo, arenilla... la cubertería sucia, tazas con manchas marrones.... En las paredes había muchísimo polvo y marcas. La ventana de la cocina llena de grasa, el estor... El baño no estaba muy sucio, pero el fondo del váter tenía una costra difícil de quitar incluso al rascado, aunque con el tiempo la conseguí eliminar. Empecé a limpiar, me di una paliza en la cocina, pero aún así era interminable. Se lo comuniqué, me pidió disculpas, y a los 2 días vino la hermana (muy simpática y atenta) a limpiar durante la mañana el estudio. Subió con aspiradora, y sí limpió. y quitó la mayoría de marcas en las paredes. Pero para mi un par de horas no fueron suficiente. Porque cuando compré unas sábanas más abrigadas, al cambiar la cama, me encontré que debajo del colchón y entre el somier había monodosis de gotas oculares, bastoncillos de los oídos... polvo, mucho, debajo de la cama. La silla del escritorio tenía la tela con muchas marchas amarillas de sudor, y la acabé fregando. Fue una sorpresa muy desagradable. Ya decidí ni comentar esta segunda parte, me dediqué a limpiarlo yo mismo. Es cierto que en todo momento fueron muy atentas, cualquier cosa que les dijese lo atendían, me subieron un calefactor de aire nuevo, etc.. Lo cierto es que el estudio es muy básico, pero con lo necesario, para un par de meses se adapta uno. Le falta la lavadora, que no si si habría o no espacio físico para ponerla. No obstante, en la calle a poco metros y en sentido opuesto hay 2 lavanderías. Allí mismo se puede secar la ropa, pero en la azotea justo en frente del estudio hay un tendedero, y además coloqué cuerdas. Con el viento que corre ahí arriba se seca de momento todo. La cocina es muy básica, con 2 hornillas portátiles eléctricas, así que no se puede cocinar muy a gusto. La localización es inmejorable. Vistas desde la azotea a la Sagrada Familia y torre Agbar. Al torcer la esquina la boca de metro. Mucho comercio alrededor (en frente varias farmacias, supermercados.. en la misma calle Condis, cerca de Día, Mercadonas..) Pero a mi parecer necesitaría unas reformillas: el baño, la zona de la ducha, se está agrietando, y se ve ya la raja junto a la nevera, pintar o forrar los muebles de la cocina... cableados, etc etc. Se ve más nuevo en las fotos..."},{"_id":"298415647","date":{"$date":"2018-07-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"484390","reviewer_id":"9851637","reviewer_name":"Andrea","comments":"Excelente mi estadía en lo de Alicia, el departamento es tal cual la foto excelente para una persona , cuenta con todo lo necesario esta súper equipado.

Galley kitchen with pots, pans, glasses, cutlery etc but no supplies (salt, pepper, sugar, oil etc.) Good for reheating leftovers or pre made meals. It was quiet as it's in the back of the building although there is only one window, the sliding door in the bedroom, and when the heat exchanger for the building is running it is fairly loud as it's directly below the door. When we were there the screen door was  unusable, just leaning against the side of the building and the garbage can was full, stinky and 3 feet from the sliding bedroom door. Fortunately it wasn't really hot while we were there so we only had to close the door once because of the stink. I noticed a bike rack in the backyard, good spot if you brought your own bikes although at $100/night you're probably going to spend another $5/day for a bixi pass if you want to bike."},{"_id":"80899263","date":{"$date":"2016-06-20T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4865672","reviewer_id":"163546","reviewer_name":"Karim","comments":"Great location clean and great price.

We loved the charm of the building \u0026 neighborhood (and the cleanliness of the apt).  The studio apt. was the right size for two of us who were more interested in exploring Montreal than staying around in an apt.  The apt. is a short walk to the Metro station (at Mont Royal) and a short walk from MANY dining and entertainment options.  Zaki even recommended a couple of places for dinner (we choose the \"best poutinne in Montreal\" spot).  We knew that the apt. didn't have air conditioning (as stated) but we were disappointed that the only screened opening in this interior apt. was broken.  If you are thinking of visiting in the heat of summer, this is less than ideal.  The other issue that people traveling by car have to be aware is the lack of parking in this entire area.  There is free parking in limited spots but it is only for certain times of day, so we either had to hang around the neighborhood jumping from spot to spot or risk getting a ticket (they don't tow)...we got ticketed (but were lucky because we only received one ticket in a two day period of time).  But, even though there were some issues to deal with, we loved the feeling of being a part of this active Montreal neighborhood.  P.S. The eclairs at the bakery in the Sherbrooke were the best!!"},{"_id":"88661681","date":{"$date":"2016-07-25T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4865672","reviewer_id":"84986574","reviewer_name":"Stuti","comments":"Comfortable and clean place to stay.

I called the host and he text me that there is no a/c and will just have to sleep with the sliding doors, to the outside, open at night - there are no windows in the unit. There's a fan that we kept on but it just blows hot air around. I tried a bucket of ice in front of the fan but could not cool the place down.\nThe other issue is given a $40 cleaning fee, while the place looks clean, when I turned on the shower the water back up because of hair and guck in the drain. Some towels did not smell clean and bedspread/sheets had some stains.  Not a big deal but when charging a $40 fee not acceptable. \nOverall, we were mainly disappointed because it should not cost the host much to have a small a/c unit that can be turned on for hot days and nights and that would have made all the difference."},{"_id":"174033021","date":{"$date":"2017-07-24T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4865672","reviewer_id":"25542193","reviewer_name":"Megan","comments":"We unfortunately found ourselves in a situation where our airbnb was completely uninhabitable, but our host was not willing to provide a refund. On the evening of our arrival, we soon discovered that the bathtub faucets were in such disrepair that the water could not turn off after use. As the tub filled up quicky with water from the broken faucet and a bad drain, we had to use kitchen pots to bail water out of the tub for 40 min until the host arrived. Although Zaki was immediately reachable by phone, we were unable to communicate our issue due to the language barrier. After hanging up to write to Zaki on the airbnb app, he said he would come to the apartment in 20 minutes. He did arrive until 40 minutes later.\n\nHe arrived and managed to turn the faucet off by jamming and twisting the shower head toggle and tap at the same time. Clearly, he knew the faucets were broken before but did not bother to fix it. Further, it seemed that he had broken the faucet even more in the process of turning the water off. So at this point the hot water knob no longer worked and water could only come out of the bottom spout, and not the shower head. Then, Zaki tried to tell us that this was due to \"city work\" when clearly, anyone could look at the shower and tell that it was in bad shape to begin with. He then suggested we could shower by using the KITCHEN POTS to catch water and pour over ourselves. We told him that we were leaving and he agreed to refund us the rest of the trip (2 nights). Later, when Zaki had left, he messaged to tell us that he would only refund us $200 even though we paid $108 per night plus $100 in service fees and cleaning fees.  We ended up wasting the entirety of our first day and half in Montreal dealing with the bathtub situation and filing a complaint with airbnb customer service. Luckily, they were extremely helpful and got us the full refund. \n\nAnother thing to note is that the apartment was not clean. There is a strong odour that is noticeable as soon as you walk in. The coffee maker easy used by the previous guest and was left dirty.

Two things to note is that it's smaller in person than it looks in the photos, and to get to and from the apartment, you have to climb either a steep set of stairs or a steep hill, so it wouldn't be good for folks who are disabled or have trouble walking (but we didn't mind the workout!).

Theres plenty of closet space to store all your gear. \r\n  The view is awesome too. It's a mountain in the back and there aren't any neighbours on top of you so you have privacy. \r\n  I had a couple of questions while I was staying there and Ricardo respond very quickly, he even helped me purchase a SIM card so I have access to (Hidden by Airbnb) . I highly recommended to  look into a smart phone with a SIM when you arrive.

The apartment looks exactly as in the photos, while being even brighter in reality (in the bedroom there are several large windows which we did not see on the website before). It is located in plain Copacabana, two blocks from the beach and 5 minutes walking to the Metro - making it perfect for a first stay in the city. Also at night we felt safe in the neighborhood, even though regarding restaurants and bars there is not much around and one has to go to other areas by Taxi. Unfortunately, while the rest of the apartment could be easily sold as \"Luxury 1 bedroom\", the kitchen is not so much of a luxury place to stay in and is only very basically equipped. While it is possible to cook, it's not so much of a fun experience and we did not encounter any basics such as olive oil, salt or pepper. On the other hand, you have a washing machine with dryer which is especially helpful while traveling. Finally, Ricardo is a very attentive host and waited for us in the apartment upon arrival. Every time we contacted him before and during the stay, he responded immediately and seemed to be available 24/7. As this is not the rule on AirBnB, we were very happy to have him as a host! So overall, Ricardo's place is very recommendable and we'd always like to come back!"},{"_id":"65042247","date":{"$date":"2016-03-10T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4875052","reviewer_id":"19116010","reviewer_name":"Michael","comments":"Had a great time staying here.

Anything you would need (food, market, pharmacy, tailor, cell phone, laundry, coffee, gym, nails, etc) is within a 7 block walk, and you have a quiet place to come home to. The neighborhood is safe and very convenient to Manhattan. The walk to the subway stop felt much shorter than it looks on (Hidden by Airbnb) maps and felt very safe at any hour with people always out and about, but mellow. The internet, which we needed for work, was reliable too. As a native New Yorker, I liked getting a chance to stay in Astoria too. It's a cool neighborhood in central to everything for us.

Once we accessed the emails from Irena we had no issues getting into the apartment.\r\n\r\nThe apartment is very conveniently located to the 30th ave N/Q subway line (about 5 blocks walk), a grocery store on 30th,  a Smoothie place on Crescent, \u0026 downtown Astoria with a lot of choices of good restaurants.  The neighborhood was very quiet and safe..... Astoria is quieter and more residential compared to staying in NYC where apartments are much more expensive and noisier.  The apartment itself is small as expected but nicely decorated with bathroom, living area, kitchen, and bedroom as depicted.  We ate out all meals except breakfast so did not really use the kitchen much but it was very convenient to have use of refrigerator and microwave.  The apartment was clean, the bed comfortable, and the air conditioning a blessing for the muggy weather of NYC in August.  Irena did a great job of communicating, ensuring that any issues were quickly resolved (the breaker on the air conditioner popped and was resolved with a quick email to Irena).

Nika is very friendly, though not around that much.  The location is great if you want to stay in Queens but take the train to Manhattan--it's a quick trip.  The E train and 7 train are both nearby.  The bedroom is very pleasant, with plenty of space for your things.  The room does not have A/C, but does have a good ceiling fan.  If you are allergic to cats, you probably don't want to stay here, but if you like cats, this awesome little dude named Kila is really fun to hang out with, but won't bother you much if you don't want him to.  One note:  If you have a lot of bathroom stuff, there is not much extra room in the bathroom, with limited counter space and all of Nika's things and her roommate's things in there.  Was ok for me, though.  All in all, a good experience, and I would go back.

Premessa: l’appartamento si trova al primo piano di un palazzo posto in un punto strategico per raggiungere Manhattan, infatti è a 100 metri sia dalla fermata della metropolitana linea (E) che dalla  linea (7) . In appena 10 minuti si raggiunge Manhattan, infatti l’appartamento si trova ad una sola fermata da Manhattan. L’appartamento è così composto: un ampio e luminoso soggiorno con angolo cucina e bella vista sulla skyline di New York, un bagno e 3 camere da letto, in una ci sta normalmente Nika (durante la nostra permanenza era affittata anche quella su Airbnb dato che Nika è stata in vacanza per un mese), la seconda è occupata in pianta stabile da un ragazzo e per finire c’è la camera vera e propria a disposizione degli ospiti. Dimenticavo il bel gatto bianco che è il vero padrone di casa, che vi farà capire quando ha fame miagolando e correndovi dietro,  ma del resto è molto amichevole e giocherellone. La camera è abbastanza spaziosa e fornita di un armadio ed una scrivania ed anche il letto è confortevole nonostante sia molto basso. Nonostante la cucina sia completa di tutti gli accessori di base, noi abbiamo utilizzato solamente il tostapane e l’uso del frigorifero, manca però un tavolino su cui fare piccole colazioni. Dato che Nika era in vacanza, abbiamo comunicato tramite sms o telefono con una sua amica che ci ha dato tutte le istruzioni per raggiungere ed entrare nell’appartamento. Nika comunque ci aveva già fornito tutte le indicazioni su come raggiungere l’appartamento tramite metropolitana e siamo rimasti in contatto via mail fino a quando non ci siamo incontrati la sera prima di partire. Il quartiere in cui si trova l’appartamento non l’abbiamo visitato , ma posso solo dire che ci sono un supermercato ed un paio di caffetterie a 50 metri oltre chiaramente alle due linee metropolitane, mi è sembrato comunque molto tranquillo anche di sera. In definitiva consiglio vivamente l’appartamento di Nika."},{"_id":"51021269","date":{"$date":"2015-10-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4887250","reviewer_id":"41184399","reviewer_name":"Roser","comments":"It was really nice to stay at Nika's apartment as the location was perfect and the apartment was exactly as described, i would definetely recommend it.

Nika's apartment is also located 10 - 15 min walking distance from great selection of restaurants and watering holes along Vernon Blvd. and Jackson Ave.  Another big plus for me was that a great coffee shop is located just on the first floor of the building.  Second is comfort.  I found the apartment fairly quiet from the street noise and the bed is very comfortable. I was able to get restful sleep.  Nika's apartment is clean and well organized.  It is worth mentioning that the building itself is quiet old but I think this actually adds a charm to the place.  Another thing to keep in mind is that there is no elevator to Nika's apartment from the ground level.  This was not a problem for me as I travel light and the apartment is located on the 2nd floor.  Nika's apartment will be high on my list of places to stay for my next visit to NYC."},{"_id":"105159808","date":{"$date":"2016-09-30T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4887250","reviewer_id":"47648973","reviewer_name":"Amandine","comments":"Super location !!

We were fortunate to find on street parking for free only a block away, unheard of in NYC! We were a block from the subway, a quaint park across the street, had a lovely view of the city, and great food around the corner. It was a nice neighborhood, we felt very comfortable and safe. My partner and I were very impressed with the awesome accommodations, the location, and especially meeting and getting to know our host. She made us feel very welcome, provided a clean environment, helped answer any questions we had and over all made our stay very pleasurable! We connected better than expected with our host having many things in common, we now consider her a friend. We look forward to visiting her again on our next trip to NYC and are excited to use AirBnB when traveling elsewhere.

I knew the location would be great as I used to stay just a couple of hundred yards away but sadly that apartment has been demolished :(\n\nThe location really is perfect; being just outside Manhattan in Long Island City you are slightly away from all the craziness but only 4 Subway stops from Times Square!  The apartment itself is lovely and forms part of a Victorian building.  The views from the light \u0026 airy living room are stunning; especially at night!  Being on the mainland you get some amazing views of Manhattan that you would not get if you were staying in it!  Ask Nika for places you can walk/drink/eat and get a great view!  \n\nAs I said, the apartment is conveniently located for access to Manhattan and there are also a number of great bars, restaurants etc in close proximity.  \n\nNika as a host was great fun and made our trip even more enjoyable!  She is very chilled out and kind of 'adapts' to your personality.  For example, myself and my partner were there for a week, so after rushing around all day we'd like to chill in the apartment.  If Nika was around she'd happily join us for a chat/glass of wine etc and gave us recommendations of where to eat/drink.  Another couple were there at the same time and weren't quite so sociable so Nika let them get on with what they needed to do and helped them out when they asked any questions.  What more can you ask from a host than one that fits in with you?!\n\nNika also has a beautiful cat whom we completely fell in love with!  If you're not a cat person he will leave you be :)\n\nI don't know when we'll get back to NYC but when we do we'd love to stay with Nika again if she's still doing this caper!  We got on very well together and we're now working on her to visit us in England :)\n\n\n\n"},{"_id":"153759756","date":{"$date":"2017-05-21T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4887250","reviewer_id":"52882102","reviewer_name":"David","comments":"we were only in the city for one quick night,  but Nika's hospitality was incredible.

They were super sweet and it wasn't a problem, just surprising when you don't know what your walking into at 10 pm.\n\nOur room was good size and we were delighted to have an air conditioner! Bed and the little pull-out chair futon were very comfortable. Nika left bottles of shampoo, conditioner, water, and towels for our use.\n\nWe found free on-street parking close by and instructions to get in were easy.\n\nVery much a student vibe and I had flashbacks of crashing at people's apartments back in college. Nothing fancy but perfect for our needs.\n\nOh, and complimentary nudges from the cutest and friendliest kitty were a bonus!"},{"_id":"331045882","date":{"$date":"2018-10-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4887250","reviewer_id":"59872711","reviewer_name":"Caterina","comments":"Nika is a really good host, she was very nice and friendly to me and my friends.

She is a super nice and helpful girl with a cute and cuddly cat. The communication was always great and she gave always useful tips if some were needed. From her apartment it is a 5 minute walk to the Subway station court square, where you can get to the 7, E, M and G train.\nFrom court square you are within 10 minutes in the city (3 stops to Grand Central). There are also supermarkets and some nice restaurants around the apartment and the Hudson River, with a great view of the Manhattan skyline, is not so far as well. I really enjoyed the stay at Monika’s place and can really recommend it to anyone. Thank you, Monika for a great stay!"}]}
