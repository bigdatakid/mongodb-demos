You can easily walk to Dumbo, Brklyn Heights, Vinegar Hill, etc. and you can be to multiple subway stations within 15 mins and there are at least two bus lines right by the house. We took these to Manhattan, the beach, and several other neighborhoods! There's a large park across the street from the apartment with a free public pool, playgrounds, etc. So we give it an A for location based on accessibility.\r\n\r\nThe apartment itself is lovely. It's on the top floor, but it's just up two sets of stairs (the outside ones and one flight inside). It was quiet and the perfect amount of space for two of us. The kitchen is equipped for cooking.

The kitchen is very well equipped if you're one who enjoys cooking. Doug was kind enough to create plenty of storage for us, there's also an area outside his apartment where you can store suitcases and such too (it's perfectly secure as Doug has the entire top floor of the building). His neighbors are great and there for you if you need any help. The location is perfect if you're one who enjoys walking (as you're close to DUMBO, Vinegar Hill, Clinton Hill and Fort Greene). The subway is a 10-15 minute walk and you're one stop away from the Lower East Side. Highly recommend popping into Brooklyn Coffee Roasters on Washington \u0026 Flushing to pick up some coffee.

Checking in and out was pretty simple. And, I got to meet Doug a couple of times, which is always a plus when airbnb-ing.

Chambre bruyante dans un quartier isolé. \r\n\r\nCependant nous avons passé une très bonne semaine à Porto, le plus possible hors de l'appartement. Porto est une ville au patrimoine très attrayant et très festive. \r\nEn espérant que ces quelques détails pourront être améliorés pour les prochains locataires, car cet appartement reste spacieux et bien équipé.

It is in a new building, flat itself must have been renovated recently and what you can't really see in the pictures: it is quite big(seriously telling from the photos, I thought it would be smaller).  It is not a strict city center but everything important can be reach on foot(Cedofeita is 20min walk) or by using close by metro. To get to the beach(Foz, which is my favourite one), you can take a bus from the stop just opposite the apartment.\r\n\r\nClarence answered for every of my question and even a little earlier check-in was not a problem.

Había otros roomates pero ellos y Anthony fueron muy respetuosos de la privacidad nuestra en todo momento, casi no los veíamos. La zona es buena y segura, aunque el subte esta un poco lejos ya que es a 3 cuadras largas (las que son de E a O, que son 3 veces mas largas que las que corren de N a S en Manhattan), por ende por las noches y por el frío siempre volvíamos en taxi, pero para una época mejor (verano), realmente las 3 cuadras largas no son un gran problema. Hay mucha oferta de restaurantes por la zona. El departamento cuenta con cable e internet de rápido acceso, y el cuarto tenia un refrigerador que funcionaba muy bien. Ademas y dado que el cuarto era grande, teníamos una mesa y 2 sillas como para poder comer ahí inclusive, y ésto fue muy bueno también. La limpieza del apartamento en general era buena así como la del baño, y Anthony nos recibió con toallones, toallas y un juego de cama limpio. Impecable.

He told me I could wait in a dunking donuts a few blocks away. (clearly,. an exciting nyc spot I was dying to go to.) I told him I had plans with friends at midnight and asked if either I could get the keys from a doorman or a friend of min could pick them up earlier. He told me doorman in NYC didn't do that (which is not true - I have stayed with many friends previously in Manhattan and their door mans have either given my keys or let me knot their apartments) and that I could carry my stuff around with me and check in later than midnight if I wanted to stay out with my friends because he planned to stay up a little later. 1. What kind of job gives a few hours notice that you need to \"drop something off\" at that hour on a Friday? It made me feel very unsafe. 2. It would have been nice to know that I would need to wait earlier than the day of arrival. 3. My flight arrived early (which Anthony should have known since he told me he would tack my flight) and I texted him before 10:30 saying that I was in a cab on my way, asking if I would catch him. He stated he had already left. A courteous host would have seen that my flight landed early, and waited. I arrived at the apartment area around 11 and had to wait over an hour (he got home after midnight) for him. 4. My host in Chicago had a lock box at the outside of his building with the keys and texted me the code. Anthony could have done that and avoided this whole debacle. My boyfriend and I had to wait in a bar with our stuff (which was awkward) and miss our plans with our friends. Then, the place was not as great as the reviews implied. The bed was uncomfortable and small (my boyfriend is 6'2\" and his feet hung off the bed). The bathroom was also not as clean as I would have hoped. And there were several mops in the bathroom, creating a weird smell in it and taking up space. Also, the bathrooms have no locks. Also, Anthony told us he would send us the wifi code upon arrival but he never did. Otherwise,..."},{"_id":"48098038","date":{"$date":"2015-09-23T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3760592","reviewer_id":"41280649","reviewer_name":"Pradeep","comments":"A good location in NYC.

However if you want a car, conveniently there are parking space for free on the building. My favorite way to go around south zone is by bike taking the bike from Itau bank. I love them, they are fun to ride along the beaches in Rio, you can get them in one point and leave it on another and they are pretty much everywhere.

Reason: Guys, the ocean, the trees, our soil, our water, our earth which we all should and will care for.

I love to travel, to learn new cultures, study languages and people, get to know new people and new ways of living. I am currently living in Hawaii, studying to be a midwife, working as a doula (Angels who help sister deliver babies) and managing a few projects in Rio. So although I visit Rio for 3 months a year, Im based in Hawaii and also get to travel around the globe. \r\n\r\n I can say I am a people's person and love to make people feel good, from hosting to cooking, to massage, thru teaching yoga... etc. I just love to share the things that make me passionate about life in this world. \r\n\r\nThat's why I love to talk about Brazil, travel around Brazil and to share the features of this amazing country I am proud to be from. Brazil is my home and Rio is my heart. I am born and raised in Rio, and have experienced this city in a lot of different ways. Here I have been a Law student with long downtown areas and party scenes at night, I've been a nature seeker with long trail/nature hours and good sleep at night, I've been an artist with long days dancing and knowing the theatre/circus scene, I explored Rio as total tourist living in a hostel, and now I have been exploring it while working with education as a citizen and cultural productor. I grow up and its seems that Rio grows up with me. Its always different and better, everytime I come home.\r\n\r\nWhen I travel, I like to feel like I am from there. I like to feel like I am doing what the locals do, feel that I am interacting with the place and its people in its fullest, and so I am a very open traveler. When I host, I like to understand peoples needs, a person who comes to Rio for a bussiness journey, will have different expectations of a person who is traveling for tourism. Or a person who is traveling with family, thinks different than someone who wants to enjoy the party scene in Rio, etc. So, I do love to hear from you, and I will do my best to accommodate your needs. \r\n\r\nSince I don't live full time in Brazil, and because together we can reach places we could never reach alone, I have lovely a co-host who helps me with this. Together we want to create unique ways for our guests to feel welcome.\r\n\r\nThat's why, we want to hear from you, your opinion is very important to us on this new journey. Our ideal is that the world can be only one, we are one and can live likewise, with love. A big community of people that altogether we can do beautiful things for ourselves, our community, our planet. We want to show love to people, and part of it, we will do by hosting you on the best way we can. \r\n\r\nWhat is your ideal? How can you feel home? What are things that could improve your experience in a new country? How do you like to meet people? What are your intentions with your trip? If you could choose something, anything, that would make your trip the most memorable, what would you envision? \r\n\r\nLove,\r\n\r\nCarolina\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOlá Comunidade Airbnb,\r\n\r\nMeu nome é Carolina, e eu sou... um poquinho... \"cigana\". Eu amo viajar, conhecer culturas diferentes, estudar linguas e pessoas, entender e conhecer pessoas e novas formas de viver.\r\n\r\nNo momento, me encontro no Havai, estudando para ser Parteira, trabalhando como Doula (Anjinhas que ajudam mulheres a dar a luz.) e gerenciando alguns projetos no Rio. Eu moro no Rio metade do ano, uma outra parte no Havai e alguns meses consigo viajar, quando meus desejos sao realizados. \r\n\r\nEu posso dizer que sou uma \"pessoa de pessoas\", porque gosto de fazer pessoas se sentirem bem. De hospedar, a cozinhar, massagens, professora de yoga, etc. Eu simplesmente amo dividir com pessoas todas as coisas lindas que me fazem ser apaixonada pela vida nesse mundo. \r\n\r\nPor isso eu amo falar sobre o Brasil, viajar pelo Brasil e poder dividir essas experiencias por esse pais maravilhoso, o qual tenho orgulho de ter nascido em. O Brasil é minha casa, e o Rio meu coração. Aqui ja vivi diversas fases e conheço cenas diferentes. Desde de uma estudante de Direito com longas horas pelo centro, e conhecendo as festas de noite, á uma naturalista com longas horas no mato e em trilhas e dormindo muito a noite, á artista com longas horas de dança, teatro e circo, já fui turista por completo morando em um hostel, e agora tenho explorado o Rio com projetos pessoais, trabalhando em educaçao e as vezes produtora cultural. Eu vou crescendo e parece que o Rio cresce comigo, é sempre diferente e melhor quando volto pra casa. \r\n\r\nQuando viajo, gosto de sentir que \"sou de lá\". Gosto de viver a cultura e interagir com os lugares e pessoas ao maximo. Por isso, sou uma viajante muito aberta a experiencias. Quando hospedo, gosto de entender as necessidades pessoais de cada um, uma pessoa que procura meu apartamento para uma viagem de negocios, tem expectativas diferentes de alguem que veio á turismo. Pessoas viajando com familia, tem planos diferentes daqueles que vieram a procura da festa perfeita ou etc. Logo, eu gosto de escutar voces, e entender as suas necessidades, vou fazer o meu melhor para acomoda-las. \r\n\r\nComo não moro constantemente no Brasil, e como juntos chegaremos aonde jamais conseguiriamos chegar sozinhos, conto com a ajuda da minha Co-Anfitria. Juntas  nos queremos que os nossos hospedes se sintam em casa, o maximo possivel, queremos inovar e trazer experiencias lindas e diferentes pros nossos hospedes.\r\n\r\nPor isso, queremos escutar voces. A sua opiniao é muito importante pra a gente nessa nova jornada.  Nosso ideal é que o mundo é só um. Somos todos um, e podemos viver assim, com amor. Uma enorme comunidade de pessoas que juntos, podemos construir coisas linda pra nós, nossa comunidade e nosso planeta. Queremos distribuir amor para as pessoas, e parte disso fazemos quando hospedamos nossos hospedes da melhor maneira que podemos. \r\n\r\nQual é o seu ideal? Como você se sente em casa? Que coisas poderiam melhorar a sua estadia em um pais diferente, ou em uma cidade? Como você gosta de conhecer pessoas novas? Quais são suas intenções nessa viagem? Se você pudesse idelizar alguma coisa, qualquer coisa, que faria sua viagem inesquecivel, qual seria sua visão? \r\n\r\n\r\nAmor,\r\nCarolina","host_response_time":"within an hour","host_thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/10716263/profile_pic/1420741620/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","host_picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/10716263/profile_pic/1420741620/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","host_neighbourhood":"Ipanema","host_response_rate":94,"host_is_superhost":true,"host_has_profile_pic":true,"host_identity_verified":false,"host_listings_count":10,"host_total_listings_count":10,"host_verifications":["email","phone","reviews","jumio","offline_government_id","selfie","government_id","identity_manual"]},"address":{"street":"Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","suburb":"Ipanema","government_area":"Ipanema","market":"Rio De Janeiro","country":"Brazil","country_code":"BR","location":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-43.19914945166575,-22.986221877558727],"is_location_exact":true}},"availability":{"availability_30":9,"availability_60":24,"availability_90":46,"availability_365":126},"review_scores":{"review_scores_accuracy":9,"review_scores_cleanliness":9,"review_scores_checkin":10,"review_scores_communication":9,"review_scores_location":10,"review_scores_value":9,"review_scores_rating":93},"reviews":[{"_id":"20159047","date":{"$date":"2014-09-24T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3800450","reviewer_id":"17730622","reviewer_name":"Claudio","comments":"Ubicación, Ubicación y Ubicación.\r\n\r\nSi voy nuevamente a Rio me quedaré en el mismo departamento.\r\nHubo una mala coordinación, afortunadamente Paula posee más de un departamento por lo que se pudo solucionar el inconveniente.\r\n\r\n"},{"_id":"24189422","date":{"$date":"2014-12-22T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3800450","reviewer_id":"23905413","reviewer_name":"Elisa","comments":"Passamos uma semana perfeita!

It is exactly as described online and as shown in the photographs.  I have rented several apartments in the Ipanema area and this was by far the best one with the greatest location.  It is within a few steps of all public transportation and a myriad of great and reasonably priced restaurants.  Best of all, the owner, Carolina, is extraordinarily gracious and responsive.  Any small issue will be resolved to your satisfaction immediately.  I already have rebooked for next year at this time.  The only mistake you could make with this apartment is not renting it if you want a place in Ipanema for 2 or 3 people   It has a queen size bed in the bedroom and a sofa that pulls out into a separate bed in the living room.  Most importantly for someone like me, the wifi is particular fast and strong and always working.  You can walk to the beach in less than three minutes.  There is a supermarket about 200 meters away.  The Hippie Fair in General Osorio Square is directly across the street.  But there is absolutely no street noise as the apartment faces towards the sea and not the Square.  There is no security concern because the apartment is in a condominium building with a reception desk that is staffed 24 hours per day.  And while none of these folks speaks one word of English, they try their best to be of assistance in the rare situation where you might need something.   In addition, this apartment offers the unique plus of having daily maid service during the weekdays.  These people are extremely nice and efficient.  They clean the bathroom, throw out the garbage, and mop the floors and make the bed.  A really nice convenience!  Trust me, if you stay here you will love it.

The location is amazing, in front of one of Ipanema's main squares, which is also where a metro station is located and many buses stop there. A block away from Ipanema beach.

El apartamento es tal cual se ve en las fotos, con limpieza diaria incluida si uno quiere, recepción las 24 horas, pileta en el edificio, contando con un placentero balcón que da a ella y con vista al mar que baña la playa de Ipanema. Tiene una hamaca paraguaya colgada allí muy bienvenida.

As someone who has stayed at many Airbnbs, all over the world, without any issues, and as a former Airbnb Superhost, I would strongly discourage people from staying here unless significant remediations are made. Even though there are many positive reviews, it's just not worth the risk.\n\n- Security issues. A friend, who could have been anyone, walked up to the building's front desk, said the apartment number (without providing my or his name), and was handed my apartment key, no questions asked. The front desk did not ask for ID or try to contact me. When I told the host about this incident, she responded by suggesting I was lying. It was extremely concerning and uncomfortable, especially given the crime in Rio.\n\n- Safety issues. The elevator broke down while I was inside it (coincidentally, only hours before midnight on New Year's Eve). We called for help using the in-phone elevator only to be connected with the front desk staff that was unable to provide any comprehensible instructions for how to exit. This was not a language issue; they just couldn’t say anything other than “a call was made to the elevator company.”  After several minutes, I was able to figure out, without their help, how to open a manual latch hidden above the door and jump up to safety (elevator was stuck mid-floor). Throughout my stay, one of the two elevators was often out of service. I have photos that show this. After my stay, rather than offer any refund, the host complained about needing to replace the elevator phone, which was broken out of panic, but not by me, but by someone else in the broken elevator during the incident (there is video evidence of this).\n\n- Water issues. Only two of us were staying at the Airbnb, yet we regularly ran out of hot water when taking showers. The host responded by saying, since it's hot in Rio, people don't take showers with hot water.” This is not only false (friends staying at other Airbnbs had hot water just fine), but also totally unacceptable for an Airbnb at this price.\n\n- AC issues. The bedroom air conditioner does not properly modulate temperature, so it is either extremely cold or extremely hot (despite changing the temperature on the remote control). When I told the host about this issue, she responded just by saying the AC was new and that couldn’t be the case.\n\n- Linen issues. Several linens were soiled when I arrived. The mattress cover had rips and stains, the mattress was dirty, and there were no pillow protectors. I have photos that show this. When I told the host, she responded by telling me I was lying and that I caused these problems.\n\n- Other minor nuisances (that I normally wouldn’t even bother to mention, and would still give 5 stars in spite of, but will note in the context of the other above problems): Electrical issues - multiple outlets did not work properly. The hair dryer broke after 10 seconds of use. Wi-fi went down during my stay. Given all of the other major issues and the rude and unhelpful responses from the host, I did not even bother bringing these other issues to her attention.\n\n- Host. It should now go without saying that the host was both rude and unhelpful. Rather than offer any level of refund, apologize, or even just offer helpful solutions, the host generally responded to my concerns by claiming I was lying.\n\nI strongly discourage you from staying here. There are other Airbnbs in the area that are safer and have significantly better value. Again, it's just not worth the risk."},{"_id":"400256149","date":{"$date":"2019-01-11T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3800450","reviewer_id":"111729612","reviewer_name":"Gonzalo","comments":"Excelente lugar, cómodo, súper limpio y cerca de todo.

We registered four within the two rooms; tight but doable. \n\nWe booked the property in three separate sessions over a period of two weeks. We also paid an understandable small fee for an extra person in the room. \n\nThe house was very nice, furnishings quite cozy and the ground and 4-block distance to the train station optimum. The laundry machine and dishwasher were very nice though a bit hi-tech for the less technically inclined. My wife had to help when the in-laws needed to wash.   I do have a few comments. \n\nAir-conditioning was inadequate. There was a low btu unit in the living room that serviced that room, the dining room,  kitchen, foyer and TV room. Even in moderate heat, the capacity would have been insufficient and NYC was suffering a heat wave at the time. Our folks' boiled lobster, combined with another group of guests' cooking pungent Texmex tacos probably didn't bode well for an odorless environment.   \n\nThe beds were comfortable and room quite pleasant but there was no window aircon. Instead, there was a very noisy standalone room blower. My in-laws elected to keep it off and open the windows. Two of them further elected to hang out on the livingroom sofas until midnight where there was some respite from the heat."},{"_id":"42763493","date":{"$date":"2015-08-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3812222","reviewer_id":"2577519","reviewer_name":"Lauren","comments":"Ruth was incredibly hospitable, and my mom and I had a lovely stay.

We wanted a central location in Queens near the U. S. Open site, and this spot was it.  It is within 3 blocks of the subway and within 4 of the railroad.  The local grocery store is super convenient and also close.  This is a very safe neighborhood and very close to Austin Street where there are tons of small shops and restaurants. Fantastic food and baked goods available everywhere. \r\nRuth and Carlos were around just often enough to be convenient but not too often to interfere with our privacy.  And Miriam, the housekeeper, was very friendly and helpful.  \r\nWe walked through three different parks within walking distance and discovered things I am sure most of the residents of Queens are too busy to know about.

The little sitting room was nice to have, too - we loved the couches so much we're considering buying our own of the same brand :)\r\n\r\nWe used to live nearby, so we were familiar with the neighborhood and loved being back there. Austin Street is within walking distance with really great restaurants! Try Bareburger (7 minute walk), and Hot Bialys and Bagels down in Kew Gardens (15 minute walk). \r\n\r\nFor first time visitors to NYC, Forest Hills is a bit of a trek to Manhattan (30-45 minutes at a minimum on subway).

A young woman named Miriam lives in the house, even though Ruth and her family are not there during the week.  The house is in a great section of Forest Hills - it's safe and walkable right up to Queens Boulevard, for everything you might need.  Keyless entry to the front door is easy and really safe. Because I'm a B\u0026B owner, I think a 'vacation' breakfast might include fresh fruit and eggs, but location trumps all of that.  It was an easy walk to see my new grandbaby!  Thank you, Ruth.

I, together with two classmates (we're three exchange students in US), went to NY for a three-day trip and we'd like to find an Airbnb safe, comfortable and convenient for our tour in downtown Manhattan, but most of the home stay we found before didn't meet all those requirements. Ruth's house surprised me at first: super host, five-star reviews and fair price! I booked the room immediately cause I'm sure it must be a great deal. And sure it is. \r\n\r\nWe arrive on the Friday evening at around 10 pm and Ruth was just there to welcome us. She was such a kind, easy-going person and she introduced us around the house with great patience. The room is perfectly matched with the picture and since we were three people going there, the host even made the bed for the sofa bed so that we could take a rest the moment we entered the room. Everything is just as described, clean, quite and extremely comfortable. There were plenty of foods and drinks in the kitchen and you can satisfy your stomach easily every morning. What impressed us most is that the guests in Ruth's house are all in great manner and the common space are always clean and in great order. What's more, the communication between us and the host (no matter Ruth or other two assistants) were pretty smooth and they're always keen to help.\r\n\r\nOverall, highly recommend to everyone going to NYC for travel or work! I'll definitely stay in Ruth's house again if I will be in NY again!

Any of the three bedrooms are comfortable, and use of the common areas: living room, tv room, dining room, and kitchen, truly make you feel as if you're staying in a family member's or friend's home. The master bedroom has a comfy king bed with an unbelievable bathroom. We were spoiled using the fantastic shower and jacuzzi tub! Our son and daughter-in-law enjoyed the ensuite bedroom with the queen bed and wonderfully private attached sun room. Finally, the bright and cheery double bedroom has a nice-sized hallway bathroom for its use. Each morning, you awaken to freshly-made coffee and breakfast items such as bagels and English muffins at your disposal. Having a driveway in which to park up to three cars is a big plus so you don't have to hassle with on-street parking. The closest subway stop is a few short blocks away which will connect you with anywhere you wish to travel in the city. If you catch an express train, you'll be in Times Square in about 30 minutes! We made two trips to JFK airport, which is only a 12 minute drive with no traffic (not counting time spent trying to pull up at the arrival terminal...have fun!). Austin Street with its great variety of restaurants and shops is a short walk away. It's also nice to walk in the more residential section of Forest Hills where the former U.S. Open stadium is located. Even though the house is located near the highway, the school next door buffers the noise, so it's very quiet at the house. One day, we even walked to Citi Field to watch a Mets game. It's about an hour walk, which takes you through the old NY World's Fair grounds and past the current U.S. Open Tennis Center. Do not hesitate to stay at Ruth's place for a visit to the Big Apple!\n\nJuly 2018"},{"_id":"316571615","date":{"$date":"2018-08-31T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3812222","reviewer_id":"156315995","reviewer_name":"Pierre","comments":"It's the little touches that make the biggest differences like having coffee made in the morning.

It was INCREDIBLY comfortable in all regards.  Private spaces were roomy, clean and well-stocked with everything we needed -- and the beds were exceptionally comfortable.  My husband wants to find the same mattress for home!  Our teenage daughter enjoyed having her own little suite adjoining our room to lounge and sleep comfortably on her own.\n\nWe were lucky enough to meet the homeowners during a busy holiday weekend and they were delightful and as kind as could be.  We also enjoyed meeting their resident helper, Dave,  a member of the family (and therefore well-invested in our comfort and positive experience) and a joy to spend time with, along with his trusty companion, Taco -- an absolutely beautiful rescue dog who made missing our dog back home much easier.  If you are not a dog person, Dave is extremely conscious of your comfort and keeps him on a leash and constrained to a 3rd floor living area away from guests unless you indicate a comfort level with the dog -- so no worries if you don't want a dog around (though for us it was truly a bonus!!).\n\nThe home is beautiful, conveniently located, includes generous amenities and easy neighborhood parking (and the driveway is available to share with proper organization/arrangements with keys if you need).  We hope to make this a regular spot when we are visiting family in NY.  It was easy enough to get on highway to Little Neck or Brooklyn, and just SO comfortable.  Ruth and Carlos, the homeowners, are kind and seemed genuinely happy to have us. \n\nI would not hesitate to recommend this AirBnB to anyone at any time.

Very helpful that guide books were also provided in the apartment. Instructions on how to get into the apartment via key pad were clear and easy, which was helpful since we arrived late at night. The only issue was the key to access the apartment (which was recommended to use in addition to the key pad) did not work. We would spend 5 - 10 minutes each time we entered and left the apartment trying to get the door to lock with the key. We did call the number provided to us and reported the problem, and they responded right away and were very pleasant. They were unable to fix the lock before we left but I assume the problem has now been fixed. Other than the one issue with the key, the apartment was lovely and I would recommend it.

He responded immediately to all of my texts and emails- I don't think the man ever sleeps! His staff was also great. I met both Azra and Marielle and they were very helpful. They will print tickets/boarding passes for you, help you get the layout of the city, and help quickly with anything else that you need. \r\n\r\nThe apartment was cute and, in addition to sheets and towels, provided amenities that other airbnbs haven't, including dish soap, laundry detergent, hand soap, and lots of kitchen utensils. It was really nice to have the washer/dryer. The apartment is a little bit tight, except for the master bedroom which is very spacious; the pictures posted here are very flattering. The beds are really comfortable and the apartment was exceptionally clean when we arrived. \r\n\r\nThe location is good if you don't mind taking public transport to get to the beach and the majority of the sights. We like to walk, so it was a bit far from the Gothic Quarter, Las Ramblas, and other attractions. However, you can always get a taxi from the front door, and they are pretty cheap, even to get across town. \r\n\r\nMy only complaint would be the noise. Upon arriving, you will be assailed with warnings that you need to be quiet at night. If only the other tenants had the same warnings. The second bedroom has a window into the building's \"courtyard\", which is really a fancy way to say fire escape, and kitchen access for a restaurant in the building. It was extremely loud with drunk tourists, babies crying, dogs barking, whooshing water going through the retro-fitted plumbing, and the kitchen staff yelling at each other in all hours of the night. However, I would still recommend this apartment to others, just take your ear plugs."},{"_id":"52876124","date":{"$date":"2015-11-02T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3815305","reviewer_id":"45565639","reviewer_name":"Ruth","comments":"Although we never actually met Fernando his emails were always polite, courteous and  helpful.

If we were to stay again however we would try to be closer to the gothic quarter as it has far more charm than the new town.\n\nAs others have stated previously the apartment can be a bit noisy. We were only woken once by what seemed to be a group argument on the street. The rest of the time we did not have any trouble sleeping.\n\nFernando had sent Azra to meet us and help us to settle in. She was very helpful and was extremely prompt with her replies.  If there was a problem we were confident Azra would help us. It was great to have this level of security.\n\nThe apartment itself is not as new as I had expected but then the price reflects this.

There are nearby metro stops and cafes and others have remarked about the market a few blocks away. A short walk down Passeo St. Joan toward the arc de triompf will land you in comic book store/manga heaven. Fernando was very easy to work with. His instructions were very clear and he was responsive to questions. The apartment is well furnished. Especially helpful were the travel books and maps. The beds were comfortable. As others have remarked, the bathroom is compact typical of retrofitted European apartment buildings, but it's clean, the water pressure and temperature are good and Fernando provided lots of towels.

We arrived late into Barcelona, Fernando messaged us with instructions on how to get into the flat - as all the doors are key coded. Flat doors also have keys, so that you can dead lock the door aswell. We had absolutely no problems. We were also able to leave our luggage in the flat on the day of check out as no one had booked to check in on that day, this was a massive help as our flight to leave Barcelona was in the evening.\n\nSaying that Locking the door with the key was a problem. It was impossible for my girlfriend to lock it on her own, I had to do it all the time and it took a bit of force. We actually thought we were going to break the key on a few occasions.

Et pour être honnête, cela s'est très très bien terminé. Pour commencer, Luis a été super facile à joindre et toujours disponible et réactif quant à nos nombreuses demandes avant notre arrivée. Par exemple, le wifi n'était pas encore disponible quand nous avons réservé (c'était en cours), et Luis n'a pas hésité à nous prêter sa clé wifi avec son pc pour que nous puissions avoir accès Internet. Luis a vraiment été l'hôte parfait avec sa disponibilité et sa gentillesse. Il nous a également donné quelques conseils sur Porto. En ce qui concerne l'appartement, il est super. Très propre, grand, lumineux, calme. Il se trouve à environ 10mn du centre ville en bus. Le bus est à 2/3mn à pied au bout de la rue, et il y en a régulièrement jusque tard dans la soirée (un bus de nuit y passe aussi). Le centre de Porto est donc très facile à joindre. Cela n'a pas été un problème. La chambre est très bien et donne sur une rue calme où nous pouvions voir notre voiture garée (parking gratuit). La salle de bain est grande, propre, avec une baignoire. Le salon est très bien et très lumineux avec tout ce qu'il faut. Quant à la cuisine, nous y avons cuisiné les 3 jours où nous étions et tout était disponible à l'intérieur. Pour conclure, si nous devions retourner à Porto, ce serait chez Luis sans hésiter !\r\n\r\nWe finished our journey in Portugal at Luis' place in Porto. To be honest, we finished our journey very very well. To begin, Luis was very easy to reach and always available and reactive to our many questions before we arrive. For example, the wifi wasn't available yet (was in progress), and Luis didn't hesitate to borrow us a wifi pen with a computer for us to get Internet access ! Luis was the perfect host with his availability and his kindness. He also gave us lots of advices for Porto. Regarding the appartment, it is great. Very clean, big, bright, calm. It's located about 10mn from the center by bus. The bus stop is 2/3mn walking, at the end of street, and there are buses regularly till late (night buses also pass there). So the center of Porto is really easy to reach, wasn't a problem. The bedroom was very nice and overlooks a calm street, where you can check your car (free parking). Bathroom was big and clean. Living room was also bright and clean with everything you need. And for the kitchen, we cooked 3 days there, it's fully furnished.

He even gave us details of taxi to use, how to catch the bus to town, where to visit in Porto and where the local shops were. We linked up on (Hidden by Airbnb) as that was the best way to communicate with him (due to free wi-fi). The apartment was very clean and he gave us plenty of towels (which was unexpected). There is a lot of amenities near the apartment, there is a launderette nearby which we used near the church a few streets away, plus supermarket, local fruit and veg shops, local bread/pastry shops and plenty of coffee shops. My Dad even got his hair cut locally! People of Porto are very friendly and most of the young people speak English very well. We travelled in early January where the weather was very rainy and cold, but the heaters and extra duvet Luis provided made the apartment warm.

The house is beautiful, stylish, and well equipped with everything you may need for a cozy stay. Luis is a very nice host who gave clear instruction for us to get to his house, and pick up us at the metro station (truly thankful). Though it is a bit far away from the so-called touring-centre-area, we had no problem of traveling around. Bus stop is right at the street corner by 2 minutes walk. All buses at the stop are going to the city centre, so no need to worry about their route. Mini store is also there while you can also take few minutes walk to the big supermarket. You will find everything there. We particular like the restaurant nearby the bus stop. It offers fresh grilled food (in reasonable price) and the cooker, waiters are nice. Neighborhood is nice too. Every morning when we were going out, both the neighbor lady and her big dogs were greeting to us at her balcony, indeed feel so warmly stay there. \r\nThe day when we were staying, it was a bit cold at night.  We found two heaters at home, so it was not a problem too. \r\nBesides, if you drive, then it is a plus that you can easily find a parking nearby.\r\nLast but not lease, we might carelessly missed out to switch off some lights when rushing out. Luis gently reminded us about the environmental concern of the future ---- for which we indeed appreciate! I think only those who truly love his flat and care about his guests would do so.  \r\nI would highly recommend Luis' house.\r\n"},{"_id":"81811878","date":{"$date":"2016-06-25T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3816200","reviewer_id":"43569769","reviewer_name":"Ivana","comments":"Luís's place is just awsome.

En bref l'emplacement complique un peu les choses mais ce n'est rien de grave ! il  faut juste avoir le temps de prendre ses marques et partir  au moins pour une semaine, de peur de perdre trop de temps. De plus pour sortir le soir c'est compliqué étant donné que le métro finit a 1h et les bus a 00h00. \r\nPour ce qui est de l’intérieur du logement, tout est très propres, rangé, et de plus il est très vaste et bien équipé ! mais faites attention a la particularité du fait qu'il n'y est pas de chauffage ! car en hiver, il fait 10 degrés dans l'appartement. Heureusement Luis ainsi que le service Airbnb ont été remarquable ! il nous a fallut attendre seulement une nuit pour bénéficier de plusieurs chauffages portatifs et ainsi pouvoir vivre sainement.

Second, the location was very hard to reach - it is in the very far edge of the city, a twenty minute straight uphill walk from the nearest metro stop. the bus is very close though. Third, the wifi did not work well enough to do more than send a text message, even when we took t upstairs as our host suggested.

We stayed a month in this but great apartment, and we enjoyed it a lot. This apartment has an amazing view of the city. I could just sit for hours looking out of the window, enjoying the view. It is a very local area away from tourists - and still, just 10 mins walk to park güell. It is easy to get to downtown, with one of the the two buses that go just from the end of the street. And be sure to take them back as well, it will save you many stairs and hills :)"}]}

Karen \"lucky\" never came to introduce herself we only met her the next day after we complained that the place was filthy. The house was absolutely disgusting it smelled the floors were so dirty that our feet would turn black and feet would stick, there was so much dirt, dust, and cobwebs that it seemed the place was never cleaned in years. The bathroom was worse than a public restroom it was so dirty that we did not want to take a shower in there, there were globs of hair in the bathtub that made it clog up and there was dirt and just disgusting stuff caked up in the bathtub and around it. The beds had crumbs and the pillow covers had stains and smelled, the sheets were dirty and the beds very uncomfortable and kept on deflating. I have traveled a lot in my life and have never ever encountered a place as filthy as this. The only positive thing was that Edgar was a very amazing person. Our host Lucky was very rude and lied about us being able to use the main house. She would not even say hello as we passed by. She is a very dirty person with a very rude attitude.  The place had no air condition and the kitchen was so dirty along with the dishes that it felt unsafe to eat or cook in their. They also BBQ right by the back window and when they do this all the smoke comes into the cottage making it black and unbareable to be in their. Please beware and do not waste your money or ruin your vacation by staying at her place it will make you feel disgusting and ruin your vacation and the fact that Lucky is soo rude with bother you even more. Her towels smelled the washer was filthy and over all it was a horrible experience. The only thing is the Edgar was a amazing person. Other than that I will never ever stay at her place. As a host you expect people to be polite and nice and have a clean place ready for you I don't think she should be in the business because she does not possess the skills needed to be host. Please beware of her place. Also there were bugs in the place and that was due to the filth of her cottage. There were roaches, flying tiny gnats and bugs because the place was so very dirty. Please consider my review before deciding to stay at her filthy place.

It was clean, well supplied (plenty of fresh towels, dishes, etc) and the bed is comfortable. I loved falling asleep to the intermittent Manoa rain, and waking up to the birds. The cottage is situated in the backyard, which is a lovely location--you'll be surrounded by green! The neighborhood is absolutely beautiful. I loved to take walks in the morning and evening in this quiet space. The cottage is a 7-minute walk from the Manoa Marketplace, which is a perfect spot to stock up on some groceries, get a slice of pizza, or take advantage of the amazing farmer's market on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays. With guidance from Karen's informative binder, I even walked from the cottage to the Manoa Falls. When I wasn't exploring the neighborhood or surrounding area, I was at a conference at the university. I was so excited to realize that I could access campus across the street from the cottage! At first I didn't even realize campus was *right there* since it's such a quiet area. I highly recommend Karen's cottage, especially if you need to be on campus and want to avoid the high-traffic tourism near the beach.

If you have adventurous young child or are a free-range parent, know that there are breakable items in the cottage and some cleaning containers and the like are in an open area under the main house (the cottage itself is fine.)

Having stayed at the hyatt, doubletree, embassy suites and the likes in waikiki, i can say we’d much rather stay at karen’s place.  Unlike the draining atmosphere of a hotel, where the AC never quite works, the elevator shaft is on the other side of the wall, or the neighbors next door have a 4am departure and keep banging doors, karen’s place is serene, breezy, and at night you can listen to the rain and breathe the ginger fragrant air. For a family of 3-4 it is just perfect. Parking is very convenient and free (unlike the $37/day in waikiki) and you are in the sought after manoa valley, with a few restaurants, a nice farmer’s markey, and a starbucks and a bakery so many japanese tourists must visit and take pics of (why?! Because i did see them all the time doing just that, there must be some historical importance to the place). \nThe towel supply is ample, the shower pressure strong, and karen is a lovely host.  If you are lucky and the place is available, do not hesitate, stay there! We stayed in late July and were not bothered in the least by the lack of AC, because the place is so airy and breezy.

If you are bringing a lot of people on a budget, it could work nicely.\n\nHowever, the space was pretty run-down. The fold-out couch did not fold back properly and was terrible for seating. Veneer in the kitchen (and particleboard under the counter) were peeling and crumbling. A couple of louvers of glass in the lanai windows were missing. The fridge was old and rusty and tempermental about closing properly. There was a smoke detector mouting bracket, but the smoke detector was missing. The kitchen/living area lighting was a couple of overhead fluorescent tube fixtures. The chairs on the patio were indoor upholstered style and kinda moldy. These kinds of problems made the space unpleasant to hang out in when we weren't sleeping.\n\nOn the plus side, the beds and the sleeping area were comfortable, and the garden outside was lush. And again, the space was probably capable of hosting many people in a functional way.

There is ample parking if you travel with a few cars which is great. Good size kitchen/dining room/living room area, and a sizable porch for hanging out on as well. It's also in a great location and has a nice view of the ocean. You are within a mile of anywhere in Kona, which makes getting around super easy.

Location is absolutely amazing, Perfect walk to the downtown Kona area (the hill can be extreme for little tiny kids though). We loved the ocean view from the place. The A/C in the living room cools pretty much the whole apartment, it was impressive. It was awesome to come home to a cooled down place after being in the sun for hours. Theirs another A/C in the main bedroom--we didn't use it too much because the fan there was good enough for us, but it was a nice touch as well. The swimming and beach accessories were awesome too! She had boards, snorkeling gear, beach chairs, kids beach toys, life vest, floaties, and much more. We def enjoyed them. \n\nThe only downfall that we had was the washer and dryer. Not only is it coin machine ran, but also Both the washer and the drier weren't functioning very well. We ended up handwashing our laundry and hanging it to dry. It honestly wasn't much of an issue to hand wash, but it would have been more convenient to have a working W\u0026D.  I did let Christy know about this and she contacted me quickly, and she said she'd get on it soon when she visits. So that's great to hear because we are interested in coming back to this place next year when we visit again! YAY.

The apartment is a good space for a couple, even with the grand piano it was spacious enough (especially as we had 4 suitcases!). During our stay there was a bit of a heat wave in New York and being a ground floor unit with a big beautiful window with just a sheer curtain, which let in so much light also made it very warm even with the air conditioning - this might have been a building issue as we found the hallway of the building to be extremely humid during the hotter days. In saying that it would be really cozy in the cooler months. The area was one we'd not explored previously - more on the quiet side (if that's even possible in New York) but very close to the Flatiron, Union Square and also East Village which are more lively. I'd highly recommend the burgers at Ampersand Bar which is walking distance from the apartment."},{"_id":"176758071","date":{"$date":"2017-07-31T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3905849","reviewer_id":"32992529","reviewer_name":"Camille","comments":"Esmond's place was incredibly beautiful. From the large windows to the grand piano, he delivered a wonderful apartment in the Gramercy Park neighborhood. The apartment was indeed wonderful with just a tiny dust and heating issue. My roommate has severe asthma and non severe sleep apnea. On our first night she didn't sleep. She couldn't breath as it was roughly 80-85 degrees upstairs. She ended up sitting in the kitchen all night as that was the least problematic place, for her, in the unit. After a couple nights of not sleeping for my roommate, we decided to purchase an air mattress so she could sleep downstairs and breath comfortably. When placing the air mattress we had to move the coffee table over an inch which revealed a massive amount of dust everywhere. It was probably one of the worst dust situations I had ever seen. This was especially surprising since I was just informed of the recent cleaning. However, all it took was a few boxes of wipes, which I purchased, and a broken vacuum, that we found in the home, to fix the issue. Unfortunately and unbeknownst to me, I had a roommate who was unaware of the contract I had signed with Esmond and  slipped on a few of Esmond's rules : such as having house guests one night and placing materials on the piano.  When Esmond brought it to my attention, he dealt with it effectively and with kindness. Along with the rules mentioned above, he also said that the air-mattress was not permitted, although I couldn't find that rule on the Airbnb website nor the sheet he left me.  That was cleaned up between Esmond and I and we were back on the road to a good stay. Until I experienced a small amount of despair when the building  informed me that, per Esmond's contract with the condominium, Airbnb's are not ever permitted in the building. I went to look for the sheet Esmond had left me, upon arrival, and it did state for me to tell anyone, if asked, that Esmond is my cousin. I would've rather Esmond messaged that to me prior to the stay, or listed it on the site, as it possibly would have changed my mind when deciding to stay at an Airbnb where I would have to, for lack of a better word, lie to someone. With that said, I apologized for his inconvenience as I, in retrospect, ideally should've communicated with my roommate the specific details and inquires set forth by Esmond prior to our stay. None the less, I am pleased with the stay I had with Esmond and the issues we experienced throughout the stay were simply a small line of communication errors.

The apartment is a stylish space that was well equipped. However, the other reviews were unfortunately accurate in that the loft area became unbearably hot. Since the apartment is facing the street and is on the first level, I could only keep the windows open when I was close by.

Location is fabulous - right in the thick of all the action in Darlinghurst and walking distance to everywhere I needed to go during my stay. \r\n\r\nThe guest room is stunning - super comfy bed with high quality linen etc. Spotlessly clean and the most amazing view from the floor to ceiling window. Guests have their own private bathroom which again was spotless, great water pressure etc. Naveen has thought of all the little details - there is even a box of hotel style toiletries/amenities for guests to use. Their dog Felix is super cute and very well behaved.\r\n\r\nI was very busy during my stay, but Naveen and Tris were very relaxed about me doing my own thing. They took me to a local cafe for a great coffee on my last morning and it was really nice to get to know them a bit. \r\n\r\nTris even went out his way to drive me to the airport when we found out that trains weren't running. I really felt like I was staying with friends. I found them very easy to communicate with when booking and Naveen responded promptly to all of my messages. \r\n\r\nWould absolutely stay here again and have already recommend this property to friends who are planning trips to Sydney.

The area is bustling with cafes and well-rated restaurants. Naveen and Tris were attentive hosts even though they had just come home from a long trip themselves. They went out of their way to interact with us and we even stayed up late one night chatting over wine. \r\n\r\nThe location is very close to King's Cross station which makes it a breeze to do day trips (we did Blue Mountains and Bondi) and get to/from the airport. However, the only con is that there is no direct subway line or bus to Circular Quay/the Rocks area. Walking 20min, you're in the city, but it probably took us 30-40 min to walk to the Rocks area.\r\n\r\nOverall it was a pleasant stay!"},{"_id":"29566672","date":{"$date":"2015-04-09T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3936009","reviewer_id":"23237886","reviewer_name":"宇辰","comments":"This is obviously a great place to stay.

The train was just 5 minutes away and we could get to almost anywhere within 40 minutes.   \r\nNaveen and Tris are a cute couple, they were super helpful, I think I must have messaged Naveen 30 times throughout the trip asking questions from places to eat, to places to shop and visit.  They knew almost all the answers to my inquiries and on the rare occasions they would find it out for me in no time.  The main problem was not having enough time and appetite to visit all the great restaurants they recommended. \r\nAs for the apartment, it is exactly what it looks like in the pictures, (which for me was the main reason I chose their place,) living in tiny apartments in Hong Kong, I find the place very spacious and all the necessary amenities were their for you on your arrival.  Their little pet Felix was also very friendly and is a great companion when the couple is out for work.\r\nAll in all, my first bnb experience was perfect and thanks to the couple, airbnb has a new loyal customer.

We want to thank her graciousness and consideration towards us as we fumbled through our last few days, trying to say bye to the amazing city. Naveen and her husband were also nice enough to provide interesting guides to cafes, maps and provided a thorough walk through of the neighbourhood which incidentally is - we believe to be - one of the cooler neighborhoods if you enjoy pubbing and cafe hopping.\r\n\r\nHer home was exactly as described in the listing if not better and wowed us the moment we entered the house. We had our own private toilet just outside our room and was delighted with how immaculately clean the it was. Our room was cozy and the mood lighting light (that amazingly has 6 colors to choose from) made the room funky yet extremely homely. The space in the room was spacious enough for two people and 3 luggages. The bed was also extremely comfortable and to top it off was provided with comfy bath slippers and robes. Her living room is definitely one to check out and her husband Tristan gladly talked to us about how the design came about.\r\n\r\nIt was a pity we did not get to try out the gym, the pool and the sauna which was literally the adjacent room from the house.\r\n\r\nLastly, Naveen's dog has got to be the friendliest and cutest dog we have met in our travels, being extremy warm and cuddly and perhaps only barked once throughout the entire stay to greet us when we came back. It really gave us no trouble at all despite Naveen's joke on being a threat to our shoes.\r\n\r\nOverall, the stay was good and we would recommend the place to anyone who wants to be close to the city but yet need an affordable place to stay. \r\n\r\nThanks Naveen!! \r\n"},{"_id":"42113797","date":{"$date":"2015-08-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3936009","reviewer_id":"30878732","reviewer_name":"Dan","comments":"Had a lovely stay with Naveen et all.

It's a 5 min walk from the Kings Cross subway station.  The neighborhood has a bunch of great bars and restaurants.  It's centrally located and you can easily walk to many parts of the city.  If you are a light sleeper (I am not) then the street noise could be a bit bothersome on a Friday or Saturday night because the windows are single-paned (I did not have any problems with the street noise), but otherwise the accommodations are exactly as described and shown.  Comfortable bed, private bathroom, workout room and pool on the same floor.  Staying at this place felt like staying at a nice hotel in many ways.  Naveen and Tristan's wifi signal is strong and fast.  They provide soap, tea and fresh towels in your room should you need those things.  You can come and go as you please and Naveen and Tristan are a wonderful couple and excellent hosts.  They are easy to talk to and they offered many good suggestions about restaurants, bars, and sites to see (thank you for the Lil' Darling and ferry to Manly Beach recommendations!).  Naveen even graciously invited me to dinner with her friends; who were just as enjoyable to talk to as N \u0026 T.  And for dog lovers, little Felix will warm your heart.  I would absolutely recommend this room to a friend or any person looking to stay in the heart of Sydney with three wonderful and interesting hosts.

We stayed just one night and it was a great experience overall. The bedroom and bathroom were very clean. Naveen is extremely organised and thoughtful, providing a number of things for guests to use from bathrobes to a beach bag to quality bath products to a candle and mood lighting. A unique room with floor to ceiling window overlooking the street. And a gym, sauna and pool! (Be sure to check out the view from the pool). Naveen was flexible with our requests, including a late check-out, and check-in was easy - they have a concierge desk where we picked up the keys as they were not home when we checked in. Tristan is also a great guy. One thing to beware of is that you may be tempted to steal their dog Felix - friendliest dog ever! Only thing to note is that the downstairs kitchen, living area and balcony are off limits so it's just the room and bathroom - kind of like a hotel set-up, but the location is extremely convenient with lots of cafes, supermarket, bakery, juice place etc. all very close by :-)"},{"_id":"62127241","date":{"$date":"2016-02-11T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3936009","reviewer_id":"57658532","reviewer_name":"Paul","comments":"Great room in a great location, can't recommend this highly enough.

We initially booked for Saturday to Monday but ended up extending another night and checking out Tuesday evening. She was really accommodating considering my friend had a late flight and even let us check out at a time suitable to us even upon a late request. Checking in and out was a breeze!

Naveen and Tristan where away for the most part and when they are in, they are usually hanging out in the leaving room down stairs. \r\n\r\nThe building is a bit on the fancy side with a concierge downstairs (which kept an eye on my language during the last day) and a swimming pool and a gym with a fantastic view of the harbor and opera house.

The apartment is beautiful and comfortable with much attention to detail. I was given a great bedroom with a very comfy bed and had my own beautifully appointed private bathroom. The place had the feel of a five star hotel, but with the added bonus of Kerri's friendliness. Immediately downstairs is a very cool cafe serving awesome breakfasts, so I ended up passing up the generous continental style breakfast that Kerri had offered me. The apartment location is perfect, as just down the road is the lively area of Newtown with its many bars and restaurants.

I selected Kerri’s accommodation for ease of commuting by train and the beautiful décor.  I balked at the prospect of hauling all my luggage up a slight hill to her place, and Kerri cheerfully was at the Petersham station in 5 minutes on a Saturday afternoon to drive me to her apartment.  I found the Stanmore Station (less than a 15 minute walk past some nice houses) easier, and walked it at night and felt safe.  I was at Kerri’s for a demanding conference, and being at her place was like a relaxing resort.  The home ambiance is so beautiful and the plant and sun make it a very special home away from home.  Some of the memorable touches:  really soft sheets, a well-appointed private bathroom, a friendly cat, the self-serve breakfast of fruit/cereal/yogurt laid out in the morning (one morning she left eggs and a tomato with a pan and spatula too), the plants and view from the veranda where I ate and read, and the lovely decorations from her travels.  There’s also a nice, upscale grocery just down the street.  We didn’t see too much of each other, and the lengthiest time we spent was when Kerri generously took me to my rental car office in Mascot near the airport.   Kerri’s friendly and adaptable when you have odd plans like I did.  It was a treat to stay here!  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"_id":"23534723","date":{"$date":"2014-12-03T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"394428","reviewer_id":"15838981","reviewer_name":"Jessica","comments":"Great place and a lovey apartment!

Come on 96th and Riverside drive, a great bike available in the living room, huge rooms with TV and ELEVATOR  and you get to take your animal  along.  True he could have put brighter bulbs in the lights and fixed the furniture but this was a week stay and not meant to supply all needs for everyone.  My advice to Mike is the raise the price and expect complaints but for now yu get what you see.\n"},{"_id":"172666190","date":{"$date":"2017-07-21T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3952093","reviewer_id":"126929721","reviewer_name":"Kahina","comments":"C'est un belle un partement et une bonne situation, mais il lui faut un Grand Netoyage."},{"_id":"174028458","date":{"$date":"2017-07-24T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3952093","reviewer_id":"86724642","reviewer_name":"Dorine","comments":"Really nice apartment, in a quiet residence and close to a park, nice for breakfast in front of the Hudson river ;) A very appreciable comfort after hard days walking in the city..

We had a few maintenance issues but Mike was quick at working on them and will surely find solutions before he rents out again.

Many good grocery stores in walking distance. The apartment itself is very spacious and has a nice feel to it. The only downside was that there is really is no place to put your things except to keep them in the suitcases, as the dressers and closets are full. The kitchen could be better equipped and organized, but we were still able to manage to cook our meals there. Mike was very courteous and helpful. We will definitely stay here again when we return to NYC.

Imagine the  nicest train roomet you have seen - tiny, tiny room but with a firm beautiful bed.\r\n The host was exceptionally helpful and friendly, as was Miko the pug. The apartment was clean and the great cereal and English muffins for breakfast were an added bonus. The place is on the ground floor and sitting in the backyard  in the morning and at nightfall was a treat.\r\n I do not walk well and crucial for me was that three good bus lines are right outside (bx19 one block to connect to the m4 and m5, and the m101) and the subway is five minutes away. I often came home late after concerts and felt safe: enjoyed the people I met daily on the buses.\r\n\r\nthanks darcy, constance and miko for such a great visit.

Super friendly, but not really demanding, loves attention but also her own time! She knows heaps of tricks too!\r\n\r\nBrilliant apartment, used the space well; the room you will stay in (most likely) appears small but more than enough space for sleeping and loads of very cleverly arranged storage (I was able to fully unpack my huge suitcase into the drawers and wall shelves); if that were not enough, you're made to feel very welcome in the lounge/kitchen all the time!\r\n\r\nGreat variety of food for breakfast with Jack specially paying attention to things I may have been preferring to ensure he didn't run out!!! (How legendary is that?!!)\r\n\r\nLocation - seemed safe and civilized enough! I guess always just exercise caution as you usually would being out late etc! \r\nVERY easy to get to anywhere from here - I was so surprised (I made it to the Brooklyn Bridge in 35 mins!), and the 'subway'/trains are very good!\r\n\r\nThey are very organised (they even have a crib sheet for guests so you can easily understand the tv, the wifi etc etc with ease!), caring and just generally awesome! \r\nYou'd be missing out if you didn't stay here!"},{"_id":"33298181","date":{"$date":"2015-05-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3953585","reviewer_id":"27806777","reviewer_name":"Alexey","comments":"Jack is a wonderful host and the pug is adorable.

Mike and Cristina were extremely friendly and welcoming, we even got a little toy for our baby! The only difficulty we had was related to a street parking. It looks like local customs imply every household should have 3-4 cars in average so all streets in Honolulu are pretty busy and this street is not an exception. So sometimes it was really hard to find a place but on the other hand hosts allowed us to block their car which helped us a lot a few times.

The house is located on a hill so it would require for you to carry your luggage's up a flight of fairly steep stairs, through the hilly front lawn, then up a few more stairs to get to the lanai/rooms.

A double bed against the wall allowed ample room to get around in the compact space.  The microwave, small refrigerator, and coffee pot allowed light cooking.  The shower stall was surprisingly roomy as the space was designed for a full size tub.  The walk-in closet was also spacious.\n\nTo get to the room, from the street, a rather steep set of stairs needs to be climbed,  then a short walk across the grass.  (The landscape is gorgeous.)  This would be a problem for some potential guests.  For the rest of us, the stairs add extra security.\n\nStreet parking initially looked like it might be a problem, but turned out not to be.  Five of six nights, we parked directly in front of the property, one night across the street.\n\nDirectly across the street is a busy bus stop.  For some, this is a plus.  For others, it might be a minor problem.  Some of the early morning riders liked to talk while they waited.\n\nThere is no air conditioning.  The screen door locks from the inside.  To keep cool, the glass door needs to be open and the fan running.\n\nWe experienced no problems.  The property is conveniently located to Pearl Harbor, which is visible from the lanai and Aloha Stadium.  My wife enjoyed hearing the band as the flag was being raised every morning and lowered every evening at Pearl Harbor.  The property is west of Honolulu proper, making the drive to Ewa, Pearl, and Hale'iwa relatively easy.\n\nOur hosts were out of town for a wedding, but through AirBnB email, and other arrangements, took care of anything and everything within an hour or two.\n\nOverall, the location and the property itself were perfect for our vacation needs."},{"_id":"36517405","date":{"$date":"2015-06-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3961051","reviewer_id":"30470760","reviewer_name":"Janos","comments":"This has been a great place to stay for the week.

If you are the kind of person who likes to relax in front of the tv at the end of the day you will need to bring your laptop with you but with a strong internet connection there was no difficulties in watching programs online.\r\n\r\nI found the bus stop to be very convenient and used it every day however if you want to travel directly to places such as Ala Moana Shopping Centre or Waikiki in a short period of time you may want to rent a car instead as the trip can take 45 minutes to 1 hour and the bus can get crowded. \r\n\r\nThis property is close to the airport (a 10-15 minute cab ride) which is very convenient if flying out early in the morning, like I did.\r\n\r\nThanks for letting me stay at your property as it was just what I needed at the end of a very busy holiday!"},{"_id":"55870552","date":{"$date":"2015-12-06T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3961051","reviewer_id":"2893560","reviewer_name":"Paul","comments":"Mike was a great host.

Firstly, the view from the lanai was lovely, location was close to town, spacious shower area and storage, and  communication with hosts was good prior to arrival and checking in was easy with good instructions.  On the other hand, the stairs leading up to the unit was poorly lit, pathway to unit was slippery, parking was a daily challenge, noise coming through the very thin walls from the other Airbnb guests in the next unit, the bed we slept on was uncomfortable and the bottom mattress was smaller than the top one by 6 inches!  The size of the unit is most ideal for one person, but with two people, it felt cramped.  The place has a local vibe for sure and I grew in Hawaii and appreciate that the hosts offer an alternative to experience the real local people and culture.

Parking was bit of a problem on first day but once we got the hang of it, it was easy to find a spot. We did find 2 cockroaches in the room at night but we can’t say if they were already there or we let them in when we opened the door. The refrigerator had some issue which we didn’t know about. We kept ice-cream in the freezer that melted. But those were minor things. We spent 5 nights there and we were comfortable. We really enjoyed the view from the balcony every morning.

He pointed me in the right direction. They seemed very nice, can’t say anything negative about them. However, once I left I noticed an additional Airbnb charge on my credit card for $75. I’m sure its for the one towel they couldn’t find after I hung it out to dry on the porch. $75 for one towel, which had definitely not been new, with holes in it and I also didn’t lose it. \r\nJust be aware this is not an entire home you are purchasing, its a private room, with no A/C (which is advertised) I overlooked that amenity when booking. Also the views of Pearl Harbor are not that great, but the views you do get are very beautiful regardless. My suggestion for anyone staying in Hawaii for any reason, is to just shop around EARLY. I secure this place about Feb sometime, for my trip in July 13, 2016. Places were already booked for those dates... Just FYI. \r\nOn a good note this place isn’t horrible, its just not a place you would want to spend a lot of time in, go out and see all of Oahu!!!

It was well away from the craziness of the rest of the island, particularly Waikiki, so we really appreciated the quiet, relaxed feel of the place. We also really enjoyed sitting out on the lanai at the end of every day. The space was tidy and exactly what we needed since we wanted to spend most of our time outside. The only thing we thought would make the space better was a larger bed (but my husband is 6'4\" so that's mostly his problem, lol). Also, it would probably get a little toasty in the summer as there is no air conditioning, but we didn't mind as we were out at the beach or elsewhere during the day. Our hosts helped whenever there was any confusion with parking and they even added some lights along the staircase and path to our room to help us navigate when we came home in the evening. It is fairly out of the way of most of the city, but there were several chain restaurants close by for a quick bite to eat so we would definitely recommend having a rental car for this location. We used the bus a couple of times, which is conveniently across the street, but as per usual public transit, it takes awhile to get places and we didn't want to waste time sitting on a bus when we could be on a beach.

So the location of the lodging was very important. And Michael/Cristina's apart served as a glove for us - perfect! This place is great for a couple with no frills. Very clean, with ceiling fan and another on the floor. There is a shutter on the front porch to 'avoid' a little the fury of the sun and keep the room a bit cooler. The bathroom is nice and spacious. The 'closet' is large and accommodates two suitcases on the floor, with room to hang clothes. There is an umbrella available and two beach chairs, plus diving goggles/snorkell and beach mat. Also, a drawer with three drawers to organize the other clothes. We were lucky with our apartment neighbors (there are two apartments, side by side), ther were very discreet. It was possible to keep up good with their musical and television taste because of the sound insulation, but there was no problem with loud sound, loud conversations, was really fine. Above the apartments is the house of the owners, and they are always available for any eventuality. The couple's daughter wakes up around 7:30 AM but we were never bothered by crying or moving on the upper floor. Access to the apartments is done by a staircase and requires some effort, especially on account of the suitcases. How we wore vintage uniforms, staying for almost ten days, we took more weight - smaller stays will require less physically in that regard. But for the day-to-day, it was ok and comfortable. We liked the bed, big enough. There is a fridge, and the microwave oven, that we never used. There are two chairs in front of the apartment and a small armchair on the inside. The view over Pearl Harbor is good and the sunset usually turns into a spectacle, especially on days with a few clouds. It is easy to dispose of trash, including recyclable. We do not face the higher temperatures because time of the year. However, the fans installed were enough to allow us to sleep closing front doors. The bus stop is well ahead and the noise generated by the engine can disturb a little bit. In our case we were always exhausted and slept very well every night, with the door closed, the ceiling fan turned on, and hardly noticing the outside noise. Now the best part - the people. Michael and Cristina were sensational. Very educated and so gentle. Michael is very calm and helped us out the first night indicating Nico's restaurant at Pier 38 (and it was great), as well as other nearby shopping \u0026 food points.

Michael and Cristina were very kind to provide, tea, bathroom soaps and shampoos, soy sauce, and ear plugs. We should have used them while our neighbors were having a great time.

It's really nice and cozy inside and I love how it had a microwave and a mini fridge (makes life so much easier). The view is absolutely amazing! Almost every night my husband and I would just sit out on the balcony and just relax. Everything in the studio was clean and if I needed anything Michael \u0026 Cristina were just a few clicks away. There was even beach stuff and board games in the closet which was awesome!  The only down fall is the parking. We noticed that if you returned back home by 7pm (the latest) you'd find decent parking, def not in front of the house. Our second night here we wanted to stay out a little later (9pm) and had to circle the neighborhood to find parking. Luckily, after circling around the block 4-5 times a car just so happened to leave that was parked in front of the house. If you end your days early this studio would be perfect but if you're more of the exploring type and don't want to \"rush back home\" for parking...this may not be for you, at least not in July from my experience.

Sure I lost a lot of money but it's not worth sacrificing a some good rest over. The studio itself is clean and the view is nice but there's a serious mosquito issue. Not even 5 minutes there my husband and I had our blood sucked several times in the room. Yes I get this tropical weather can attract mosquitoes but I've never had this issue with any other Airbnb among the islands. Mention this to host and they didn't seem to care or offer any help. Just a reply that basically said ... sorry nothing we can do for you it's the weathers fault. Besides that pictures of the area are somewhat misleading. Definitely seems more worn down that the pictures represent. Parking is not easy to find. Streets are extremely narrow. Area safety seems kind of iffy.  \n\nOverall I wouldn't ever go back to this place or recommend it to anyone. If you want to enjoy your vacation don't come here.

There are a lot of stairs leading up to the place, and though they say there are 2 parking spaces for guests out front, we only got to park there 2 nights out of our stay... we had to part about a mile away and on hills most of the time! It is a pretty packed neighborhood full of hills, so maybe don’t book if you rent a car! There are TONS of lizards and geckos around, which is fun. But also at night the cockroaches come out in full force, not so fun. We actually found one creeping around in our folded towels but there was roach spray ready for us!

Garcia is the swish street of Rio, if you have money to spend. It's where you'll find Cartier, Luis Vuitton, H Stern, the jeweller, Nike, among other international labels. But there's also a great bakery and grocery store, KiKarnes, just opposite - if you like coconut, I highly recommend their \"quejadinha\" (like macaroons). It's just one block from Praça Nossa Senhora da Paz, where they are building a metro station. The square is home to my favourite market of all - the fruit and veg market on a Friday morning. See how many fruit and veg you can find that you've never seen before: jabuticaba, piranga, cajú, cajá, jaca, chuchu, inhame. The neighbourhood has a great village feel to it. All along Visconde de Pirajá in the direction of Praça General Osório, there are shops, cafés and juice bars. Praça General Osório is the heart of Ipanema. It's where the metro is.

I would recommend using the yellow Aerocoop taxi service. The stand is outside the terminal building to the right. It should be easy to spot. Please, whatever you do, do not take a taxi driver who comes up to you and asks \"Taxi?\" - even if they have a genuine yellow taxi. They are likely to have fiddled their meter so that it comes out to double - or more - than the real fare. This has happened to two of my guests recently. One paid $100 (US dollars) from GIG - four times more - R$75 is $25 at the moment. The other paid R$75 from the city airport SDU (it should have been half that.) Both of them got into taxis after being asked if they needed one. Just ignore them, walk to the right inside the terminal building until you see a yellow Aerocoop/AeroTaxi booth still inside the building. The queue should be just outside those doors.

Oh -- and the apartment has a view of the Christ statue!  \r\n\r\nFor city \u0026 beach lovers, this place really couldn't be more perfect. \r\n\r\nPlus, the owners were super helpful to us through the entire process.

But he was upbeat and gracious and so welcoming.

Despite Jan being out of town, he was quick to respond to all our messages and inquiries about our stay.  We were able to do a late check out on the day we were leaving which was nice since our flight did not leave until 9pm.    \r\n\r\nThe studio was exactly as pictured on the website.  The location could not have been better.  The building and location felt very safe at all times.  The 24 hour doorman was nice.  There were tons of restaurants, bars, shops, etc. within walking distance.  The metro was just a few blocks away, we only took it once to the Centro but it was nice to have it so close.   We went to the fruit/veggie market and the sunday Hippie market, both awesome.  Tried Nectar for breakfast/lunch, delicious lunch plates.  One of our favs was on the beach, Posto 9 at the Uruguay flag, the carne sandwich, so good.  \r\n\r\nI can not wait to visit Rio again, it was such an amazing city.

O apartamento é adequado para duas pessoas e supre as necessidades. O apartamento estava limpo e arrumado no dia da chegada e o anfitrião foi muito solícito. O chuveiro poderia ser melhor, a água é um pouco gelada para os dias de temperatura amena.

Contatei o Pedro perguntando sobre a possibilidade de fazer uso do chuveiro eletrico e o mesmo me afirmou que este não funcionava, que nunca ninguem havia falado sobre o chuveiro não esquentar (mesmo tendo mais de 2 hospedes abordando isso nas avaliações) e novamente foi rude falando que o chuveiro poderia não estar tão quente quanto eu gostaria (a agua estava gelada!).\nEnfim, o apartamento tem uma localização excelente, porteiros muuito simpáticos.

The design of the space was perfect and made a small place seem spacious.  We loved having a large TV with cable in the living room to unwind in front of after being out all day or to watch the news while working on my laptop at the dining room table. My wife was able to use the bedroom closet for her luggage and I was able to use the main closet for my luggage to keep our stuff out of the way.  Being able to get on the 7 train in less than 2 minutes was a huge bonus.  LaGuardia Airport was only 15 minutes away when taking an UBER.  The host was very helpful during check-in and we were happy that there was 2 sets of keys in case we needed to split up (some listings we have stayed at only had one pair of keys which made things difficult).  The bed was comfy and there were plenty of pillows to suit our needs (4 big pillows and a small pillow).  The WIFI worked wonderfully and that is always a big plus as we always need to be connected.  The fridge has ample storage for left overs or if you want to store groceries and there is a stove/oven/microwave/toaster to use for cooking.  The balcony was a nice feature so we could step outside to check the weather in the morning or to sit outside at night and have a glass of wine.  Being on the second floor was also great as it was easy to get our luggage in and out without getting too tired.  Anytime we had a question, the host was quick to respond through the AIR-BNB message system.  The neighborhood had plenty of places to eat within walking distance if you wanted a bite without venturing out.  Totally loved the place and would definitely recommend it to anyone!"},{"_id":"48925333","date":{"$date":"2015-09-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3975630","reviewer_id":"40905218","reviewer_name":"Sam","comments":"Alejandro communicated with me ahead of my stay and accommodated my request to check in early.

No cuenta con lavadora de ropa pero hay una lavandería grande a 1 cuadra, así como farmacia y supermercado.

The neighborhood has been predominantly African American since the 1930's. Before that, the area was a mix of Germans, Irish, Jewish, and Italians. Recently, there has been an influx of immigrants from the Caribbean and Mexico, and from other Brooklyn and Manhattan neighborhoods. These brownstone lined streets are shared by the rich and the poor alike,  with a mutual respect for each other.  We are living in a dense urban environment, with all of its pros and cons. All around us on Hancock Street are working class families, Wall Street types, writers, artists, social workers, city workers, and professionals of all kinds. As I write this, kids across the street are playing a pick up game of basketball.  The music of Brooklyn. This is a real neighborhood with real history.  As more people move into the neighborhood, more shops, restaurants, and bars are opening to join the ones tha","notes":"Bedford Stuyvesant borders the always hip neighborhoods of Bushwick and Williamsburg. The B46 bus will take you into the heart of Williamsburg for a fun night out!  Also nearby is Crown Heights and the Brooklyn Botanical Garden.","transit":"The subway (A and C) is about 8 minutes away, and the A train will get you into Manhattan in about 20 minutes.  The A train also has service to and from JFK airport.  We are also about 10 minutes to the J train in Bushwick.  The B46 bus will pick you up at the corner of Hancock Street and Malcolm X, and will take you into Williamsburg, or just use UBER!  We can also provide you with the most reliable car services that we use ourselves.","access":"Guests may use the backyard.  Feel free to enjoy your morning coffee, cigarette, or evening cocktail outside at the table.  In the summer months I try to have many flowers in bloom.  Smoking is allowed outside only.  Also, sit on the stoop in the front if you want to take in our lively and eccentric neighbors!   Sadly, I must insist that jumping on the trampoline is strictly off-limits.","interaction":"David, myself, and our two children live upstairs.  One of us will be available to you to answer any questions and to get you comfortably set up downstairs during your stay.  The doors to the apartment lock for your privacy.

Location is great - really close to all the good neighborhood restaurants, grocery store etc.  I liked the apartment, but it did lack a door to the bedroom, which I failed to notice in the pictures. (My fault)  The bedroom is located between the living room and the kitchen and it's really small.  The bed was a little low, and only a full size, which we aren't used to, but very nice linens and comforter.  There is an outside area with a table which we didn't take advantage of, but it is a nice space.  The hosts provided a bottle of wine, fruit, coffee and half and half, and some breakfast stuff in the refrig, which was much appreciated, since we got there about 7PM on Friday night.  I loved their vintage kitchen!  Really cute, lots of pots and pans for cooking, great stove.  All in all it was well priced and a convenient location. It's a ground floor apt, so there isn't a lot of light with the curtains closed, which you really need to do since you are on the street level.

Bed-Stuy is a very lively area - when we stayed in June, lots of folk were out on the streets having a good time. There seems to be a good sense of community.

Bed-Stuy is a vibrant, fun neighbourhood.

I wanted a place where it was comfortable and safe.  Staying here was like staying at \"home\".   And that was the number one thing I wanted when looking for a place to stay?  It was comfortable and very cozy.  Everything you need to prepare a meal was available in the kitchen.  Nicci made it a point to have some fruit, half and half, butter, English muffins in the fridge.  And of course the two bottles of were a nice treat after waking all day in New York.\n\nAll the basic things one would need are available at the apartment.  The queen size fold out bed in the front room was good and my daughter stayed in the adjoining bedroom.  If you are staying on a hot time of the year, make sure to have the AC in the front room and the fan in the kitchen running during the night.  It keeps it perfect. \n\nEverything about the apartment meet our needs and it was very clean.  If you are looking for a place where you can make a meal and head out the door for the day and return for the evening for a meal and restful place, then this is the place to stay.  \n\nWalking to and from the subway was about an 8-10 minute walk to the Utica station.  If you want to catch some of the local eats, Nicci has a book on the kitchen counter that proved helpful.  We suggest Manny's and Emerline's for breakfast.  The food was very good at each.  For an evening of Italian food, Nicci has Sereghina's listed.  Excellent choice for Italian food.  My daughter and I highly recommend treating yourself to the Tiramisu for dessert.  It was superior. Walking through the neighborhood we felt safe.  As with anywhere, be ware of your surroundings.\n\nNow about Nicci,  What an angel!  And I mean that.  She was so kind enough to wait up for us for a midnight arrival.  And before we even arrived, she was in constant communication with regarding the accommodations and the numerous questions I had about the area.  During our stay she would periodically check on us to make sure everything was going well.  Just a true blessing to us.  She is part of the reason we will be coming back to her place.  Forget the high priced New York hotels.  Stay here because it like staying at a cozy home.  Also, the area is going through revitalization with new restaurants, businesses, and remodel of apartments.  This area will be the next \"place to stay\" in New York area.\n\nI am most definitely bringing my wife  and mother to stay here or any time I am in the area for business or pleasure.  Loved the apartment and loved Nicci."},{"_id":"40141390","date":{"$date":"2015-07-28T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4000621","reviewer_id":"4312222","reviewer_name":"Justin","comments":"Nicci and David were so easy to work with and their house is gorgeous.

We didn't necessarily want to run out and find food immediately upon arrival, so it was wonderful to see a few items around that we could snack on (actually they lasted throughout our week's stay) before getting a formal meal. There was also an assortment of cooking odds-and-ends that were in the kitchen area (olive oil, salt and pepper, etc) that made being away from home easier. The area of the bnb is a neighborhood called Bed-Stuy. It's a beautiful and historic neighborhood, a neighborhood that has a great vibe, but it's also a neighborhood in Brooklyn. It's not in Midtown Manhattan or a popular tourist area for first time NYC visitors. We absolutely LOVE the area, it's near where we lived in Brooklyn in the past with our kids, but be aware of the neighborhood before you jump into the bnb. I'd encourage you to stay in Bed-Stuy, but only after you realize that it's a bit more \"rough around the edges\" (it's not an unsafe location of course) in how it appears to a tourist than popular areas in Manhattan. That being said, if you're looking to stay in a real Brooklyn neighborhood, you can hardly do better than this spot. The house is in amazing shape. It's been beautifully maintained and has great decor throughout the bnb. This is no shabby tourist hotel! You'll be staying inside a beautiful piece of history built in the late 1800's. David and Nicci are warm and helpful when any assistance is required. They have great recs for the neighborhood (places to go, etc) and keep a great space for their guests. Also, as far as transit you'll be close to multiple helpful bus lines and have access to the express A train, which is helpful in getting around town."},{"_id":"74886170","date":{"$date":"2016-05-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4000621","reviewer_id":"13769134","reviewer_name":"Elisabeth","comments":"Après un long voyage, se faire accueillir avec le sourire, découvrir un appartement conforme à la description ainsi que quelques denrées dans le frigo pour se restaurer avant de decouvrir le quartier!!!

It was comfortable, tastefully decorated and a good size for such a long stay.  The bath was also a big plus for us as we did lots of walking as was the comfortable bed. Friends joined us for the last week and it accommodated us all easily.  The large kitchen, the use of the outside area and two sitting areas meant four of us had plenty of room.  We all found it very homely.  We really appreciated Nicci and David's flexibility in terms of check in and check out to accommodate our flights and the advice on taxis.  Nicci and David are great hosts - very friendly and hospitable and they were responsive to our needs,  They are also good company and we enjoyed spending time with them talking about the area and life in the city, watching the girls having fun on the trampoline.  Certainly that made the place feel very much our home for the month.  The apartment is close to 2 subway lines and it has 2 bus routes on its doorstep.  This made it very convenient for getting around and it was a relatively quick trip on the A express train into Manhattan and back at night.  The area is safe to walk around at night and we found it interesting particularly as it is changing due to re-gentrification.  Mannys' nearby has the best coffee we found in NYC and good food as does the restaurant Saraghina with good bread at their bakery.  The little grocery on the corner opposite Saraghina is also good for fruit and veges as well as other staples.  Oliviani has a good wine selection. The bar Lunatico has great music at night.  We enjoyed being able to go out in the neighbourhood after a day in Manhattan and also spending the warm nights in the quiet of the back yard.  So great hosts and an apartment with everything you need in a location that isn't upmarket but is safe and interesting.

They were in constant communication and really easy to get hold of. They were so flexible about when we arrived and left, even though we messed them around a bit and the apartment had everything you need in it. Right down to breakfast muffins and little cosmetics in the bathroom cupboard. Made it such a comfortable and convenient stay. \n\nI'll definitely be back if I come to NYC again. \n\n"},{"_id":"146692201","date":{"$date":"2017-04-23T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4000621","reviewer_id":"8074152","reviewer_name":"Brittany","comments":"This place is great - it looks exactly like the pictures and is very clean and comfortable.

There were snacks in the fridge and a bottle of wine waiting for us which was much appreciated because we were hungry after the flight. With hot weather the nights were muggy but fortunately they had a fan and an air conditioner that made for a comfortable stay. We enjoyed having our morning coffee (also provided) while sitting in the backyard.\nWe'd venture everyday out to Manhattan on the subway which is about a ten minute walk away. I wondered how safe this neighbourhood would be late at night but every night we'd return in the AM on the subway and felt very comfortable .The people in the area are friendly and community minded and it's quiet at night.

One morning we woke up and it was pouring rain and at our door were two umbrellas! Seriously this woman is a hospitality goddess!\n\nAt first the neighborhood and trip to Manhattan can be a little intimidating however we found both to be really quite fine. The neighborhood has a lot of great little restaurants and bars like Chez Oscar (a gorgeous little french place where you must try the truffle fries and the cheese plate) there are also a handful or laundromats who will wash, dry and fold your washing for about a dollar a pound. We used Marmies on Malcom X, they were quick and friendly and everything came back lovely and clean in a vacuum sealed bag. \n\nGetting to Manhattan is also very simple, do your self a favor and and get an unlimited Metro card, we got one for $33 for 7 days, this will allow you to ride both the buses and the subway. Buses stop on Malcom X regularly and will take your right down to Utica station where you can get the A or C or  to Kosiosko station for the J and the Z lines into Manhattan, the bus will also take you right down to Williamsberg. \n\nI can't speak highly enough of our stay we loved New York and we loved Hancock House."},{"_id":"262006148","date":{"$date":"2018-05-07T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4000621","reviewer_id":"169209380","reviewer_name":"Jasmine","comments":"This is a place we will never forget, it was so amazing to stay here!

David and Nicci have retained a lot of the classic charm of the unit (beautiful wood floors, embossed ceilings, a wide deep kitchen sink, molding along all the walls) and updated it with really thoughtful design, lighting, and details. The days I was in New York was a stretch of particularly hot, humid, stanky days like only NYC has, so I was endlessly grateful for the air conditioner that my hosts had installed in the front sitting room of the space. It definitely worked hard, and kept the place pleasant. \n\nCheck in and check out were smooth and easy, and during my stay, I saw David several times, and he was a paragon of friendliness. That kindness extended to Nicci's thorough book of advice for nearby food, drink, groceries, etc. They even had a loaf of brioche in the fridge as a welcome! I prefer sleeping with plenty of pillows, and the bed had piles of them that I really appreciated. \n\nAs I've come to expect in New York in the summers, the trains running to and from Brooklyn were more unpredictable than at other times of year as several lines were serviced, so each day involved researching the most reliable routes around the area. \n\nI would definitely stay here again.

Manhattan is only 20- 30 minutes by train. The 7 day metrocard pass (unlimited buses and trains) was beneficial and cost effective.\n\nThe neighborhood has great places for food and coffee. We especially enjoyed coffee at the Trad Room (also a restaurant), Halsey Traders Market was great for essentials and more... There's also a Vegan cafe next to the market.\n\nThere's a few laundromats all in short walking distance. We used The Laundry in BK - great customer service, top of the range washing machines and dyers. They have all your laundry product essentials as well as money change machines for your convenience.\n\nOverall we loved our stay at Hancock House and would recommend to anyone visiting Brooklyn for the local experience."}]}

When we arrived, no one was there and then called Hazel 2 times before her cleaning maid show up 15 minutes later. (Keep in mind it was very humid and hot already and we're all sweating at that moment) when we arrived at the flat, the maid then told us that she will need another 2 hours to clean the place. She said we can leave the luggage but cannot stay at the place. (We were all very frustrated and just wanted to take a shower but instead we had to go back out for another 2 hours until the room was ready. Hazel said she mentioned in the email that we can leave the luggage only when I booked this place but I don't remember seeing it and I think she could have reminded me while we were talking through (Hidden by Airbnb) again.) The location area was dirty, a lot of hardware stores and lots of banging and machinery sounds. Especially at night, there is lots of guys standing around on the street. We were at the 2nd floor,you can smell people smoking from the ground floor and I think because it's an old building in a hot weather. The sewer from the bathroom has a bad odor coming back up from the sewer hole. It's disgusting and it bothers us to fall asleep at night. No soap or shampoo provided, they have the washing machine but no washing detergent. You have to buy everything your own. It's very inconvenient. From my experience with airbnb, they have lots of better hostels with same price range and better location. We quickly realized picking Hazel's place this time around wasn't a lucky choice.

Hong Kong weather is really hot and humid. After a flight and lugging luggage there, the last thing you wanna do is wait by the streets with all your luggage. Her helper is a lady of few words. If you plan to outsource your check in and out process please do train them in hospitality. The apartment: The apartment was as advertised. Be reminded to future visitor to bring toiletries and perhaps a mirror as the whole house has 1 palm sized mirror. Also note that there is only 2 towel should you have more then 2 guest. The coridor looks really creepy and the downstairs is hardware shop. There were no noise problems and the corridor was to be expected of hong kong but it did made me a little anxious when I was brought to the apartment with someone who barely spoke other then explaining the keys and wifi. Water heater and pressure was fine despite previous comments. The Cons: Let's start with the biggest issue I have with this apartment. Privacy/ Safety. In the 4 days 3 night I stayed here 3 people has came to the house. The helper twice And a couple of people trying to convert me to Christianity Mid afternoon when we were out one day I managed to get wifi. So I check my (Hidden by Airbnb) and what not. I got a message from hazel that she needs to let herself in to fix the aircon. First of all I slept in that room the night before and there seem to be nothing wrong with it. So I quickly tried to recall if I left any valuebles out and asked my family if they have any stuff out. They said they think it should be alright but by then they have already let themselves in and I had no more wifi so I texted her an hour later that she could but she has already let herself in. Which to me I guess is alright since she did inform me. I did come back with debris on the floor but thats a small matter I guess. When the Christian came to the door we kind of panicked abit cause it was in around afternoon and we didn't expect anyone to come. They started out with saying 'they are our neighbours'. So I thought maybe they were here to complain as I think it's not allowed to sublet in hk. So we followed the instructions given which is to say we are hazels friend. Then they went through the motion of the whole conversion thang anf we kinda got the jist that they were not complainy neighbours. I guess they state they are neighbours because it's a gated apartment complex and didn't want to be thought of as trespassing. So they left eventually I think the scariest experience is when her helper came into the house unannounced.

Well this is the place the do it. My daughters and I spent 3 weeks in this apartment and we found that it met all of our needs. The check in process was clearly explained and we were met promptly. The communication with Hazel was great. It was easy to understand and follow accurately. \r\nThe apartment itself is clean and comfortable however you should note that this is in the hardware area of Ya Ma Tei and the building itself is quite old. But wait!! The location and neighbourhood (pending the usual common sense) is safe with great access to the MTR and buses. The building has security and the apartment is double dead-locked. We felt very safe during our stay.\r\nThe apartment does have WiFi and you can pick up pre-paid 4G sim cards nearby. TV is in Chinese though.\r\nNearby there are a host of great places to eat albeit you must understand that there is not much English spoken in the immediate area (you wanted authentic right?). This didn't pose too much of a barrier as a number of places have an English version of their menu, and there's some really cool apps for your smartphone. If you eat local you can eat very cheaply. For the essentials there is a Wellcome supermarket (2 min walk) on Shanghai Street and a Park'n'Shop on Canton St. You also have the Canton St Wet Market with a great selection of frest fruit \u0026 veg plus very nice cooked meats. Within a 5-10 min walk you also have the Temple Street \u0026 Ladies Markets which are great for a look. \r\nFoodwise, the local area offers a feast for the senses. Download the Open Rice HK App so you can get a comprehensive listing of cuisine and quality (its free). The price and quality in Hong Kong generally is very good value. We spent a lot of time eating in the numerous little street kitchens and hole-in-a-walls in the local area. Use the 'if the locals eat there- its OK' rule and you rarely go wrong. Loads of fun too!!\r\nCoffee enthusiasts can get espresso from Pacific Coffee in the Langham place basement from 8am and also from Knockbox coffee on Hak Po Street from 11 am. Knockbox is excellent and highly rated. \r\nFor craft beer enthusiasts \"Tap - The Ale Project\" is also on Hak Po Street with a great range of International and local brews. \r\nFor photo enthusiasts the local area is full of personality and great photo opportunities. The area surrounding the apartment is a very interesting people watching experience. We learnt a lot during our stay.\r\nRemember, the apartment is clean and comfortable but its not a 5 star experience. It was however good value for money and we really enjoyed our stay. Hazel is a very good host."},{"_id":"36862769","date":{"$date":"2015-07-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4001099","reviewer_id":"4744402","reviewer_name":"Winsess","comments":"Hazel's quick response to my messages gave me assurance that we deal to the right person altho I haven't seen her during my stay but she quickly send Lily to guide us to her condo.

We wrote her 3 emails, 2 Airbnb messages, and even sent a whatapp message (which was shown as read) but did not seem to to able to get her attention. It was until the night before our departure that I asked my HK friend to help call Hazel's cellphone and we  finally came to an agreed meet up time. Thankfully, Hazel became responsive again on the day we arrived HK. \n\nThe apartment is spacious compared to standard HK apts and the bedding was comfortable. However, we wish that the listing would indicate the fact that the outside of the building is under construction. Basically we were told and did not open the windows at all during our stay because of all the dusts. Given the humid weather in HK and minimal air circulation, there was a smell in the apt when we first arrived and it lingered for the following 3 days. \n\nAll furniture shown in the pictures are there but many of them are pretty worn out. The cover of a drawer in the bunk bed room would fall of if you try to pull it. But for a short stay, furniture is not an essential in our opinion. We did appreciate that there is an air conditioner in each room.\n\nCheck out process was simple and smooth."},{"_id":"48560923","date":{"$date":"2015-09-27T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4001099","reviewer_id":"39546731","reviewer_name":"Leeren Bridal","comments":"地點很方便,Hazel很融洽,很容易溝通,資訊準確!\r\nA+++ Host"},{"_id":"48874239","date":{"$date":"2015-09-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4001099","reviewer_id":"37940460","reviewer_name":"Miya","comments":"乾淨的房子,有機會會再去的^__^"},{"_id":"49454343","date":{"$date":"2015-10-04T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4001099","reviewer_id":"27677446","reviewer_name":"卉","comments":"还不错啊,地理位置很好,交通便利,房间配备很齐全,很干净,就是地方小点,大床的垫子太软了,客厅沙发不会整成床"},{"_id":"49889394","date":{"$date":"2015-10-07T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4001099","reviewer_id":"40660280","reviewer_name":"荣海","comments":"地方离麻油地地铁站出口走3分钟就到了,算是相当方便的了｡由于是老城区了房子都比较破旧,楼道也比较窄,电梯优点摇摇欲坠的感觉｡\n房间家具比较齐全,住的也还算OK,可能是香港本身湿气比较重,房间略微有些味道｡\n总体还算ok"},{"_id":"50852371","date":{"$date":"2015-10-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4001099","reviewer_id":"18906290","reviewer_name":"Chaoguan","comments":"good location, just 2 minutes walk to the metro station.

We had to scramble. Luckily, Airbnb has quite an extensive listings at HK.  Finding an alternate at last minute while still dreadful, is possible. \r\nHazel's 2BR's listing at Yau Ma Tei fitted our need. I sent the booking inquiry. We are very grateful for the host's prompt response as we really had not time to wait for an answer. Subsequent communication was also prompt and straight forward.\r\nThe Host was also accommodating in allowing us to leave the luggage at the unit prior to the 3pm check-in time.\r\nThe unit is roomy in the living room. The couch/sofa bed is big, but has a bigger stain. The TV has a few channels to pass time while the wife/kid is getting ready. But one should pack accordingly, HDMI cable and a properly loaded laptop for example, if more big screen time is expected. Also, pack your own power adapter. \r\nThe bedrooms are adequate. The queen bed is too soft for our taste. Accessing one of the 3 A/C requires stepping on top of the bed.\r\nThe place locates on an industrial/commercial part of town. There are multiple hardware stores/distributors at street level. All these businesses get re-stocked between 3am to 6am Monday thru Saturday. Trucks engines, air brake releases, back up beeps, hydraulic tailgate, dropped pipes, workers yelling, and many other sounds are vividly clear from unit as it's 2 floors up from the actions. BRING EARMUFFS.\r\nOn the plus side, empty street on Sunday.\r\nThe kitchen has the basic cookware and silverware, though without any cooking essentials such as oil \u0026 condiments. Other than boil something, there isn't much one can do there. \r\nAlong with no dish soap to clean the dishes, there is no laundry detergent to go with the in-unit washer.\r\nThe bathroom is small, does the job, typical of HK. Though a bigger mirror would be nice. Also be sure to leave the window open at all time. Lacking P-trap on the shower floor drain, which likely shares the same pipe as the toilet, trace of sewer odor is an ever presence at the bathroom.\r\nOverall, it's an old building on an older part of Hong Kong in one of the most expensive part of the world. One should really be realistic with the lodging depending on the price one is willing to pay.  \r\n\r\n"},{"_id":"106382579","date":{"$date":"2016-10-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4001099","reviewer_id":"94136842","reviewer_name":"文杰","comments":"跟HAZEL的沟通还算顺畅,房间比图片看起来要小一些｡一个房间的床里面的弹簧好像爆出来的,在床的边缘坐下时一定要小心,被戳痛两次｡抽屉需要大修一次,大部分都是坏了的｡清洁度还行,我们这样的粗人也不是特别介意"},{"_id":"106942289","date":{"$date":"2016-10-08T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4001099","reviewer_id":"21107986","reviewer_name":"Sigit Purnomo","comments":"Hazell is very nice person...

The unit is likely large for HK standards, but for a first time visitor, it was not what we expected. The street is lined with metal worker shops and is very loud and noisy in the middle of the night while trucks are prepping for delivery. We adjusted after one sleepless night, but may not be suitable for light sleepers. The bathroom is tiny - the shower is about 8\" from the toilet, and not separated by a wall, so the whole bathroom gets wet when the shower is on.

I love the spaciousness of the accommodation as compared to the other cramped HK apartments I've been to, also on a 3-pax trip. It's what you get from the photos shown. 1 Master, 1 Guest (where there is a bunk bed). \n\nHowever, be mindful that there'll be no space in the guest room, for your luggage but no fear, the living room is one good solution. Should you be more than 3-pax, fear not, there's a sofa bed right in the living room! \n\nOne downside during our travel is probably the spoilt bi-fold door to the toilet.\n\nOther than, everything has been great. Location is perfect, couple of streets across (5mins) and Yau Ma Tei MTR you'll be at. It is a walkable distance to Mong Kok too. \n\nDid I mention? There's a lift up to where this apartment is.

We didn't meet Hazel, but texted back and forth during the weekend about various things. She was always quick to respond and attempted to fix the most of the issues we had. Having said that we believe that the issues we had with the apt. should have been looked after before we checked in.  These things all could have been checked ahead of time. \n\nWhen Hazel's helper checked us in, she did not notice that the A/Cs in both bedrooms were not working. (outside temp in the 30's C.). Hazel did send someone to repair them, but only managed to fix one and we had to go without the other for the whole weekend because since it was Friday here was no one available till Monday to replace the damaged one.  The solution was to compensate us with a free pocket wifi. The helper brought this over and it was not working. We waited 45 minutes or more for another and that one only worked for about 3 hours. Do not rent these in Hong Kong! They are unreliable and wifi is at many places in the city.\n\nWe travel a lot around the world and all four of us said the apartment reminded us of a dormitory or hostel, with the dresser being broken in the bedroom with the bunks and a sharp spring sticking out on the mattress in the bedroom. I scratched my leg on this twice. The furniture is basic as you would expect in a dorm.\n\n My wife insists I mention the brown water leaking from the ceiling into the kitchen. It only happened for a few minutes, but she found it unsettling.\n\nAlso, it seemed quite unusual that we were instructed to let the next group of guests into the apt. if they arrived before we checked out even though they would be with the helper.  My wife was still there when the next group arrived and in they came to an uncleaned apartment. This was surprising.\n\nThis is our first stay overnight in Hong Kong, so I am not sure about the standards for the price you pay, but this apartment is just O.K.  Our family recommends you try somewhere else. It wasn't horrible, but we think you can do better for your money."},{"_id":"158676673","date":{"$date":"2017-06-08T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4001099","reviewer_id":"128508516","reviewer_name":"Siew Fong","comments":"very good host, responsive and attend to all our request promptly!\nAC was not working in one of the rooms and she immediately arrange for repair the next day. near to Yau Ma Tei station, walking distance to many places like ladies street, mongkok, langham place."},{"_id":"164603428","date":{"$date":"2017-06-28T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4001099","reviewer_id":"124442620","reviewer_name":"Bobby","comments":"The place is actually a good size for its price considering that HK is pretty expensive and the average size in HK is quite small usually.

With that said, everything is so worn out and dirty looking we were scared to even sit or lay down. We even searched up other places to book that same night because it was just so disgusting and scary. \n\nCouch looks like its gonna break in half if you sit on it. Bed linens look so dirty like it's never been washed. What looked like it was a white is now a shade of gray. Bring your own towels because the ones they provide for u look like rags that will rip when you try to use it. The tv is like a puzzle to turn on. \n\nApt is on a street that sells all hardware. There is banging, clanking and delivery truck noises AROUND the clock. 24/7.  Make sure you bring ear plugs. \n\nAnd make sure u check the check out time. When we booked it said 12pm check out but she was telling us we have to be out by 10am. Luckily we had a screenshot of the ad so she let us check out at 12pm. But apparently she didn't mention it to her crew because her clean up lady showed up at 10:20am wondering why we're still there then someone else came at 11:15am also confused as to why we were still there. \n\nAll in all... if you want to be close to Nathan St and MK area then I would recommend this place. As long as you don't mind the the disgusting bed that looks like you might catch something from it, spend 5-10 mins trying to figure out the tv, risk the couch breaking if u sit on it, don't mind using rags as towels or the noise that is heard 24/7."},{"_id":"355407496","date":{"$date":"2018-12-04T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4001099","reviewer_id":"63410024","reviewer_name":"Arlene Marie Anne","comments":"Susan and Linda's place is near MRT and a lot of food stalls around the area.

He always answered my messages on time and was very kind in providing precise information about the city and his place before our arrival and during our time in Barcelona.  Once at Barcelona and due to an unexpected early arrival of our flight,  me and my girlfriend were warmly welcomed even before the arranged check-in time. At Gabriel's place we felt at home, even if it was one of ours first experiences at an shared Airbnb we felt that we had both, privacy and spaces to socialize with Gabriel. The room and apartment are even nicer than what is shown in pictures. I specially like the decoration and the amount of sunlight that there is in the apartment, specially in the living room. Also, we thought that the neighborhood was excelent (10 minutes walking to Sagrada Familia, 25 minutes walking to Parque Guell, 10 minutes walking to the hearth of Gracia and 25 minutes walking to the Barrio Gotico), with some nice restaurants and bars but in a non-very-touristic and calm area (also the metro and bus stations are very close by). In sum, I defenetely recommend this place.

Eine Gehminute entfernt ist die nächste Station und es ist sehr einfach in's Zentrum zu gelangen. \r\nWir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt in diesem so typischen Townhouse. \r\nFußläufig sind diverse Geschäfte vorhanden um sich mit ein paar Lebensmitteln einzudecken. \r\nWir waren insgesamt 6 Nächte in diesem Appartement und würden unseren Aufenthalt gerne wiederholen. \r\nEs mangelt vielleicht ein wenig an Besteck, aber Handtücher waren reichlich vorhanden, ebenso Toilettenpapier und der Kühlschrank war mit einigen Flaschen Wasser befüllt. \r\nDas kleine Bad ist völlig ausreichend, einzig fehlt etwas Ablagefläche für die diversen Toilettenartikel. \r\n\r\nNow I'll try it in english. \r\nWhen we arrived, the key wasn't in the key box we got the code for, but Sharleen, the housekeeper was there, very friendly and she gave us the key and explained everything. \r\nWe stayed for 6 nights and had a fantastic time in New York. The neighborhood is quiet and it's only one minute to walk to get to the next train station (subway) and it's comfortable and easy to get downtown or anywhere else. \r\nThe apartment is in an old, typically townhouse. The room is big enough, also the bed which is really comfortable. \r\nThere is a table with 4 chairs and a small kitchen with the mostly used items like microwave, toaster, tableware and cutlery, the cutlery and tableware could be a little bit more :), but it's easy to be self-caterer. \r\nThe big refrigerator was filled with some bottles of water - very nice and comfortable as we arrived at a hot day. \r\nThe bathroom is not so big but big enough and there where enough towels and toilet paper. \r\nI just missed a little more shelf space for our toilet articles. \r\nAround the corner are different shops to buy food and other important things. \r\n\r\nWe felt very good in the apartment and the area and we would like to come back whenever it's possible. \r\nThank you Patricia.

J'ai apprécié le sèche-cheveux et le fer à repasser (nous sommes restés 11 jours). Il y a une laverie avec des machines à laver à 5 minutes à pied, et des commerces à proximité. Il manque toutefois des ustensiles dans la cuisine: 3 fourchettes, 1 seule grande cuillère, une petite casserole, c'est un peu juste et c'est dommage.

The bed is really comfy and the upstairs location makes it so that you barely hear street noise."},{"_id":"204076579","date":{"$date":"2017-10-16T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4025329","reviewer_id":"37779317","reviewer_name":"Céline","comments":"Dès que je suis entrée dans ce studio, je me suis dit que les photos ne le mettent pas assez en valeur. On s'y sent immédiatement bien tellement il est cosy, propre, chaleureux, pratique et spacieux pour un studio new yorkais. Le lit est grand et confortable. Le convertible offre aussi un bon couchage et vaut mieux que certains matelas. Le frigo a une partie congélateur de bonne taille et nous avons vraiment apprécié qu'il soit approvisionné en petites bouteilles d'eau. Machine à café, micro-onde, grille pain et vitrocéramique offrent le nécessaire pour prendre ses repas. L'appartement est calme et lorsque d'autres locataires ont été très bruyants, Patricia a su régler le problème dans les meilleurs délais. Nous avions de nombreux bagages et ce studio est grand, ce qui ne nous a pas donné l'impression de vivre dans nos valises. A noter qu'il y a des marches sans ascenseurs, pour les personnes ayant des difficultés. Le logement est très bien situé et le quartier de Harlem est très sympa, avec de nombreux restaurants, snack, épiceries, supermarchés etc. Sans parler du métro très accessible, bien desservi et très proche. Nous nous sommes senties en sécurité dans l'appartement et dans le quartier. Patricia est très réactive dans la communication, la concierge est très sympa et efficace. Nous avons pu rester un peu plus tard que midi afin de prendre notre avion sans avoir à attendre des heures dans l'aéroport. Je recommande vivement cet hébergement et j'y retournerai avec grand plaisir."},{"_id":"208239518","date":{"$date":"2017-10-31T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4025329","reviewer_id":"59820461","reviewer_name":"Rocío","comments":"Cerca del metro, funcional"},{"_id":"215787287","date":{"$date":"2017-12-01T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4025329","reviewer_id":"6949498","reviewer_name":"Laura","comments":"Le logement est un studio spacieux, adaptés pour 4 personnes (et les valises).\nLa cuisine est petite mais très bien équipé(micro onde/grille pain/cafetière).\nLa salle de bain avait suffisamment de linge de toilette pour 4 et pour 10 jours.\nLes 2 couchages étaient très confortables.\n\nL'appartement est très bien situé près de la ligne 2 et 3.

As mentioned in other reviews, the location is fantastic! You are only a few minutes walk to the Subway, which will take you anywhere you need to go around the city (Subway rides varied anywhere from 20 minutes to 35 minutes, depending upon where you wanted to go in the city). My husband and I felt safe in the neighborhood, even when we came back in the dark, after exploring the city all day! The bed was incredibly comfortable and the apartment was just as pictured. Patricia checked in with us after our arrival, which was thoughtful. We had a question during our stay and she responded quickly to that as well. If you are looking to save money, I would highly recommend staying here verses in a hotel.  On a side note, after talking with several locals, we discovered that the New York neighborhoods have changed so much. A lot of the neighborhoods that were once thought to not be \"good, safe\" neighborhoods, now are. Many people have moved out of the city (so expensive) into these neighborhoods, changing the neighborhood dynamics. \nWonderful stay! Wonderful experience!

I was so worried, since the unexpected change caused us to arrive later than expected-- but Anouchka was completely prepared to handle every situation and left the keys for us in a convenient place even though we weren't able to meet her as planned. Nothing beat waking up in that beautiful, warm, comfortable haven each morning and seeing the snowfall outside.

It was clean, comfortable, bright, colorful, and really seemed to impart a sense of the host (whom we did not meet this trip, but I spoke with on the telephone). The arrival arrangements were as promised, even though we were later than anticipated. Having a washer and dryer in the apartment was great. The weather was hot and humid but there was a rotating fan in the apartment that helped a great deal in that regard. We felt comfortable while there and were able to enjoy coffee on the terrace in the mornings (at least when it wasn't raining =)\r\n\r\nThe neighborhood was as described by other reviewers -- quiet, residential, diverse. A short walk to Jarry street presented a side array of options for dining, coffee, and drinks. There were several Vietnamese restaurants, Greek, Italian, and a couple of bars. We returned again and again to EtOH, which was on Jarry and St-Denis, as they had twenty craft beers on tap and good pub food. Java Mythe, which was marked in a Traveller's Guide Anouchka has put together and placed in the apartment, had excellent coffee. A bit of a walk first thing in the morning, but worth it. A walk to Parc Jarry turned up a free concert Friday evening; and over on Villeray we were able to get our poutine fix at Frites Alors. The subway, also on Jarry, was a short walk, and between that, our feet, and the 193 and 30 buses, we were able to go anywhere we wanted without having to touch the car for five days. Downtown, the Old City, the Plateau and Parc Mont-Royal, the waterfront and Atwater Market -- for the most part, were within half an hour without needed the car.

She maintained contact with us before we arrived, made sure we were clear about how to enter the apartment, and left many interesting maps and brochures about the area. She also created a neighborhood map that pointed out various locations for meals and shopping. The apartment is very clean, and super energetic and colorful. The kitchen is well stocked with necessary items and allows for comfortable meals and socializing. The rest of the apartment offers comfort amidst a creative décor. There are many lighting options, which is nice when you just want to hang out or relax. The little porch provided a great place to find fresh air while sipping on drinks or reading a book. The surrounding area, while further away from the hub of Le Plateau or Downtown Montreal, provides quick access to the Jean Talon market --- an amazing must see place --- and the #30 bus which can transport one to more bustling areas rather quickly. For the past decade or so, we have tended to stay in Le Plateau region, and were a little worried about being so far out. But in the end, this was an amazing choice because we explored the Villeray/St Michel area, as well as Mile End, places we had ignored in previous visits to Montreal. As a result of the switch, we found great bagel and gift shops in Mile End, and appreciated a week long supply of fresh berries and veggies from the Jean Talon market.  When we wanted to go out for dinner or to a museum, we found the bus (with a stop just on the corner) to be incredibly convenient, and the metro a short and interesting walk away. We did not get a chance to explore the restaurants in the immediate area, although there are many. For us, being able to spread out, to relax, and to savor foods prepared at home was a real treat, which was made even more incredible by Anouchka’s decorating talent. We hope to return next year for a longer stay, and will definitely first look to see if this apartment is available.

When you walk a little further down to the river, there is a natural bay with a nice restaurant where you can eat very tasty. We were five people 40 euros lost!

Sinks in the downstairs bathroom and one upstairs  bathroom ran only cold water. \n\nDuring our stay (first week in June) the weather was very inclement - several very wet days that were cool. We didn't have ready access to fuel  for most of the time we spent there and were unable to buy any despite numerous trips to a number of supermarkets near and far. Given the weather the house was uncomfortable and cold without a fire.\n\nWe arrived around 8 pm thirsty and peckish. There was no milk, bread or coffee.We were directed to a supermarket, 20 mins walk along a main road  but  when we got there the supermarket was closed! \nYou might bear this in mind if you are arriving  here in the evening.\nSome  clarity is needed about what is available and what is not eg fuel.

The two upstairs bathrooms are modern but the rest of the house is quite rustic.  There are two sitting areas (one downstairs and one upstairs), a huge dining room with seating for 12 I think, and plenty of space to spread out.  Three of the bedrooms have air conditioning but the one on the main level did not.  It was not an issue since the evenings were cool so we didn’t really need AC.  This house has a kitchen like in a restaurant which feels a bit odd but has everything you need: gas stovetop, a full size fridge, an oven, and lots of dishes.  There is no dishwasher though.  There was also a clothes washer which was very handy, but no dryer.  The house is about 15 minutes from downtown Porto, and there is plenty of parking in the city so it was no problem to drive there. \n\nOne downside was a persistent unpleasant smell coming from a utility closet.  I am not sure what the smell was exactly (perhaps mold?) but the house has lots of huge windows to let in fresh air so it wasn’t too bad once we let it air out.  We also would have appreciated a couple of extra towels and pillows since one per person isn’t quite enough,  but perhaps we are used to North American style lodgings since the other 3 houses we stayed at in Portugal had the same towel to person ratio, even if there was a pool onsite.  One last note is that there is a single tiny hair dryer and it is not great so if you are many people who need to dry your hair, you are better off bringing one."},{"_id":"289357510","date":{"$date":"2018-07-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"404688","reviewer_id":"5336778","reviewer_name":"Gil","comments":"Great location and architecture.

He gave nice hits and suggestions to enjoy our stay in Istanbul by providing helpful websites.  During our stay, the communication with him was really perfect in terms of language and being kind to us.  In addition to that, he offered us to help in booking our transportation from the airport to the aprtment.\n\n2- The apartment:\nThe apartment was nice and clean. It was sufficient to accommodate us (9 people) without any problem. The location was not far away from Taksim area (Istiklal street) where people can find a lot of shops, restaurants, cafe's, clubs and pubs.  The apartment is around 2-4 min from the bus station (Ömer Hayyam) which can take you to many places in Istanbul and 15 min walking from Taksim metro station. \n\n3-The area:\nThe area was hilly ( which is also the topology of a lot of places in Istanbul) which makes the movement with a baby trolly a bit difficult(as in our case). Next to the apartment, there is a market which opens on Sundays. You can get nice fruits vegetables and much more for cheap prices. However, the people leave the place with a lot of garbage and wastes ( it won't be cleaned before the next day by the city).\nThe buildings and streets in this area are pretty old. You can hear the sound of neighbors till late ( even after 10 pm).\nThe building where Garen has his apartment does not have an elevator, which can be difficult for old people or little children in the trolly. As well as the lights in the building ( along with the stairs ) were not working properly.    الشقه ممتازة ونظيفه كافيه لمجموعه كبيره تصل إلى تسعه  أشخاص يوجد فيها كل ما يلزم.  غارن صاحب الشقه لطيف ومتساعد جدا ولم نواجه ايا مشكله بالتواصل معه باللغه الانجليزيه . موقع الشقه استراتيجي ولكن سلبيتها الوحيده انها بمنطقه شعبيه جدا .قريبه جدا من السوق(سوق تقسيم ،سيرا خمس دقائق) والمواصلات العامه(من اثنين لأربع دقائق) ، أنصح بالاقامه  بسبب قربها من   الاماكن السياحيه . die Wohnung liegt in Top Lage und entfernt nur 2-4 min zur Bus Station . Sie geeignet für große Gruppe . In der Wohnung befindet sich alles ,was jemand braucht. Die Wohnung is sehr empfehlenswert."},{"_id":"200674439","date":{"$date":"2017-10-06T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4049958","reviewer_id":"149991140","reviewer_name":"Shahriar","comments":"Garen is more than perfect host really friendly great apartment everything you need is available hope everyone try there at least one time in life"},{"_id":"209322851","date":{"$date":"2017-11-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4049958","reviewer_id":"152205653","reviewer_name":"Vladyslava","comments":"Garen is a very friendly and nice host.

Дом может показаться расположенным в достаточно специфическом месте: настоящий старый жилой квартал, выглядит местами заброшено, несколько полуразрушенных домов вокруг. Но мы чувствовали себя безопасно, вечерами было тихо, а буквально 10 минут вверх по улице пешком - и ты попадаешь в совершенно другой мир на Истикляль с модными кофейнями и кучей туристов. В пяти минутах ходьбы от квартиры два небольших супермаркета. Интернет работал без проблем.\nGaren оперативно отвечал на сообщения, встретил нас в квартире, не было никаких вопросов с заселением, при выезде мы просто оставили ключи на столе. Кроме того, он посоветовал нам закусочные и кафе в районе проживания, два ресторана из них мы посетили и остались очень довольны. Спасибо за рекомендации!"}]}

Il y avait une canicule et nous étions ravis de pouvoir compter sur l'air climatisé dans chacune des pièces. L'appartement est propre, joliment décoré, aéré, bien équipé, et bien illuminé. Le quartier est adjacent à Park Slope et à Prospect Park. C'est très calme, paisible, résidentiel et sécuritaire. Il y a un super café (Steeplechase coffee) et un traiteur (Brancaccio's) à un coin de rue de l'appartement,  ce qui est très pratique pour le déjeuner et le dîner au retour des longues journées de marche à Brooklyn et à Manhattan.  La ligne F qui est à 4 minutes de marche nous transportait au coeur de Manhattan quotidiennement alors que la ligne G nous a permis d'explorer les quartiers branchés de Brooklyn.\r\n\r\nSteve et sa conjointe ont été à la fois très accueillants et discrets tout au long de notre séjour. Le choix de lecture qui était à notre disposition nous a donné un sentiment d'être chez-soi. Si la façade extérieure ne paye pas de mine, il ne faut pas s'y arrêter car une fois à l'intérieur, c'est un petit havre de paix idéal pour décompresser en fin de journée.\r\n\r\nA great place with wonderfully welcoming yet discreet owners. Clean, beautiful, lots of natural light, comfortable, design conscious yet humble appartement in quiet, residential and safe area. We discovered a new neighborhood adjacent to trendy Park Slope and Prospect Park, the F and G lines (perfect for getting to the heart of Manhattan without transfers or for discovering trendy neighborhoods in Brooklyn). Air conditioned, great choice of reading material, well equipped, a corner way from fairtrade Steeplechase coffee and Brancaccio's take out meals.

My stay was absolutely perfect and my friend and I cannot wait to visit New York again! We are absolutely in love with Brooklyn and highly recommend staying at Steve and Anna's. \n\nThe apartment is close to the F Line of the Subway which takes you directly to all main attractions like Coney Island, the Brooklyn Bridge, the Rockefeller centre and more. It is no more than a 4 minute walk from the apartment itself and the streets around this area are all tree-lined with local parks and convenience stores also a mere 2 minute walk down the street.\n\nIf I could give any advice to anyone else who is interested in seeing New York it would be to stay in Brooklyn and visit Steve and Anna's. The neighbourhood is safe, close to everything yet far enough from the city to come 'home' and relax after all the adventuring around New York.\n\nLots of love and well wishes from Mary, Serene and Jayne (Melbourne, Australia)"},{"_id":"40311285","date":{"$date":"2015-07-30T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4052514","reviewer_id":"13878472","reviewer_name":"Carole","comments":"Carole, Bruno, Alexiane et Pierre - juillet 2015\r\n\r\nNotre séjour à New York a été formidable.\r\nL'appartement de Steve est conforme à la description et aux photos.

The local Subway station, Fort Hamilton Parkway (F line - straight to Manhattan) is only a five minute walk away through a very nice neighbourhood, which includes a nice independent coffee shop, a great pizza restaurant and a small convenient store that doubles as a deli. Food Town, a large supermarket with excellent produce is approximately ten minutes walk. Steve was very helpful and flexible with check-in and check-out and communication was quick via the Air B\u0026B app. There was an informative welcome pack and a complimentary bottle of prosecco on arrival. Also provided was a hairdryer, iron and ironing board, large HD television with HD cable box (there was always lots of films to watch with the ability to restart the programme if you happened to walk in halfway through the feature), a small Bluetooth speaker, microwave, central heating and air-conditioning.

On top of that, Steve was super-flexible in accommodating our less-than-optimal travel schedules to make our stay and travel plans more convenient. He met me in person to check in very early in the morning after a red-eye flight, and my friend and I were able to check out late on the day of our flights out of NYC. The flat itself was spacious, super-clean, comfortable, tastefully decorated, and well-stocked with essentials including a fitted-out kitchen with dishwasher and a washer/dryer combo that came in useful. I was not at all familiar with the Windsor Terrace neighborhood before our stay, but it is a nice, safe and easily accessible neighborhood within walking distance of Park Slope and Prospect Park. It was a very quick 5-minute walk to the F and G line subway station, which we used frequently to make trips into Manhattan and other areas of Brooklyn.

Despite visiting in the sticky heat of NYC's summer, it was cool, quiet, private, and comfortable.\r\n\r\nWe loved the beautiful, minimalist design sensibility. The neighborhood is great--super close walking distance to coffee shops, restaurants, take-away spots, and more. Ample street parking and very very close to trains and buses. \r\n\r\nWe stayed in the apartment for a month and loved our entire  experience. Our space always felt very private but when we'd run into Steve and his family coming in and out they were always so friendly, helpful, kind, and welcoming. Would absolutely recommend without hesitation, especially for families."},{"_id":"92110292","date":{"$date":"2016-08-07T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4052514","reviewer_id":"16403723","reviewer_name":"Steffi","comments":"Steve and Anna are great hosts!

Handtücher waren reichlich vorhanden und die Küche ist mit allen Utensilien ausgestattet, um eine Mahlzeit zu Hause zuzubereiten. In beiden Schlafzimmern befanden sich sehr bequeme Betten, wir haben wunderbar geschlafen. Die nicht funktionierende Waschmaschine war auch kein Problem, da sich fußläufig eine Wäscherei befindet.\nNach einem langen, aufregenden Tag in der Stadt war es immer schön, in die Ruhe des Hauses zurück zu kehren und am offenen Fenster den Garten zu genießen.\nDie U-Bahn Station ist schnell erreicht und bedingt durch die Häufigkeit der Züge befindet man sich in ca. 30 Min. in Manhattan. Zu keinem Zeitpunkt haben wir uns hier unsicher gefühlt (späteste Rückfahrt aus Manhatten nach Brooklyn war gegen 23.30h). Im Nachhinein bedauern wir, dass wir uns in Unkenntnis der Verhältnisse und aufgrund der Anreise nach 20h nicht getraut haben, ebenfalls die U-Bahn zu nehmen, aber so haben wir die Erfahrung einer Taxifahrt im Feierabendverkehr sammeln können ;-).\nSollten wir erneut New York besuchen, würden wir wieder in dieser Unterkunft wohnen wollen.\n\nSteve and Anna were great hosts.\nWe were particularly pleased about the small details on arrival such as fruit and something to nibble and water and soda in the fridge.\nWe found the house exactly as shown in the photos. Plenty of towels were available and the kitchen is equipped with all utensils to prepare a meal at home. In both bedrooms were very comfortable beds, we slept wonderfully. The non-functioning washing machine was no problem at all, since there is a laundry within walking distance.\nAfter a long, exciting day in the city, it was always nice to return to the tranquility of Steve's and Anna's home and enjoy the garden by the open window.\nThe subway station is quickly reached and due to the frequency of the trains you are in Manhattan in about 30 min. At no time did we felt unsafe here (latest return trip from Manhattan to Brooklyn was around 11:30 pm). In retrospective, we regret that in ignorance of the circumstances and because of the arrival after 20h we did not dare to take the subway, but this way we hade the experience of a taxi ride in the rush hour.\nShould we visit New York again, we would want to stay in this property again."},{"_id":"338119833","date":{"$date":"2018-10-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4052514","reviewer_id":"4631818","reviewer_name":"Philippe","comments":"Nous avons passé un très bon séjour dans l'appartement de Steve et Anna.

The flat was very clean, comfortable and functional, newly restored and furnished as well. Additionally It was very close to the metro station (4 mins walking), to the Galata area and Istiklal where there are many shops, bars, restaurants etc. but the neighborhood is at a very calm spot, which is a great combination. Not only that, Mert and Gökçe are two wonderful people as well as hosts. They waited for us, even though we arrived late at night, so that they could welcome us and showed us around to the neighborhood. They provided us with a map of the area and a metro card, they even booked us a taxi at the day of our departure and they are at all times available when we needed information on the city.

Apart of the fact that Mert and Gökce were very friendly people, the apartment is located in the heart of Istanbul. You can literally walk to Taksim, Galata Tower and also to the Galata bridge. The subway station Sisli is the main line which takes you to the best shopping malls such as Cevahir, Kanyon, Istinye Park and many more. The neighborhood is very authentic with local people. You really feel like you are a part of the city. It was very cold in Istanbul during our stay but Mert did everything so we feel comfortable and warm. He even bought a new heater and new blankets so that we are not cold and the apartment was warm even though the weather in Istanbul was about -6 degrees.

It's not someone's home if that's the vibe you're going for and if you want to cook there's only a hob and microwave - we were sampling the Turkish cuisine so wasn't a problem for us.

The Sishane Metro station (Kasimpasa exit) is only 5 minutes walk away. Overall, the location is ideal - easy to walk to Galata, Karakoy, Cihangir, Taksim, etc.\r\n\r\nThe apartment itself is simply designed and spacious enough for us as a couple and our baby. The bed was large and comfortable, and the shower was powerful with plenty of hot water. The apartment was also clean. The wifi connection was good. The kitchen is not especially well equipped, but with such tasty and affordable food options nearby, you would be unlikely to do much cooking.

Mert is a nice host who accommodated the date change request and spent time with us over tea showing us how to get around the city. However we had the unfortunate situation that the city was working on the water lines. Mert let us know there was no running water in the unit when we checked in(not before).  At first, we were not concerned since Mert told us it should be on that evening. We went about our day sightseeing and at dinner, we sent a note asking him if it was on. He said no. It was too late so we bought some bottled water to brush our teeth and wash our face. But the water still did not come on in the morning. After a night of not being able to use the toilet and needing to shower, we contacted Mert several times to figure out what to do. After not hearing back from Mert, we decided to check out and find a hotel at 11am. I waited until I returned home to the states to try to resolve our stay with Mert directly before going to Airbnb but sadly, he did want to refund any money believing it was not his fault. I am disappointed because it is not unreasonable to expect the basic need of running water for an Airbnb stay. My recommendation is to always let Airbnb know immediately of any issue so they can get involved with the host and you are not left trying to figure out what to do on your own, especially in a country you do not speak the language. Also, you can request to cancel during your stay and Airbnb will provide you a number to call to get help instead of sending an email.  I have traveled the world using Aurbnb but unfortunately it was the first time for my friend and this experience was so horrible, she will never do it again.

Была проблема по прибытию - хозяин не отвечал на сообщения и звонки, конкретный вход в отель удалось найти с помочью местных жителей. Кроме того, впоследствии общались с хозяином только по (Hidden by Airbnb) , видимо по причине экономии со стороны хозяина. В самом же отеле общение происходит с домработницей (домоправительницей). В спальне очень удобная кровать, шкаф для вещей гостей, неплохой кондиционер. Общая комната, объединённая с кухней, тоже достаточно уютная, но на кухне только раковина, одна электрическая плитка и холодильник. Кроме того на кухне, по пути в ванную, имеется порожек на котором можно споткнуться. Ванная комнатная не плохая и есть все, что нужно, однако, присутствует запах канализации, который иногда расходится по всей квартире. Одним из больших минусов было присутствие не малого количество муравьев, что доставляло ряд неудобств. По всей видимости, хозяева знают о проблеме и в один из дней нам (как это и бывает в отелях) была предложена бесплатная уборка нашего номера-квартиры. От этого предложения мы отказались, тем не менее, на следующий день в наше отсутствие эта уборка была проведена, в том числе была предпринята попытка скрыто замазать места откуда лезут муравьи - не удачно. Помимо этого, от замазки остался неприятный запах. Сама уборка, опять же, была проведена очень хорошо, но были передвинуты наши вещи, выброшено то, что возможно можно было посчитать \"мусором\", но мы хотели оставить на память. Стиральная машина стоит внизу, в общем пользовании и постоянно была заняты - стирать приходилось поздним вечером и ночью. Качество и скорость стирки не хорошие (часто нужно спускаться и проверять процесс стирки, проблемы с открытием дверцы). Расположение жилья не плохое, есть где погулять и не очень далеко от метро. Сам дом старый, окружён небольшими улочками и домами \"окна в окна\". En soi, la location n’est pas mal, très propre et bien rangée, mais ne peut pas être appelée un appartement, c'est un hôtel et la cuisine est rudimentaire. Il y avait un problème à l'arrivée - le propriétaire n'a pas répondu aux messages et appels téléphoniques, nous n’avons trouvé qu’avec l'aide de la population locale. En outre, nous n’avons par la suite communiqué avec le propriétaire que par (Hidden by Airbnb) , probablement par souci d’économie de sa part. Dans l'hôtel même, la communication se fait avec la concierge. La chambre a un lit très confortable, une armoire pour les affaires des visiteurs, bonne climatisation. Le salon combiné à la cuisine est également agréable, mais la cuisine est seulement équipée d’une plaque et d’un réfrigérateur. De plus, dans la cuisine, pour aller dans la salle de bain, il y a une marche sur laquelle on peut trébucher. La salle de bains est bien et il y a tout le nécessaire, cependant, les canalisations sentent, ce qui se propage parfois dans tout l'appartement.

Dana was very nice and accommodating and made it a point to meet up with us and explain the ins and outs of staying on the property."},{"_id":"33340961","date":{"$date":"2015-05-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4069429","reviewer_id":"2870222","reviewer_name":"Tamar","comments":"Dana was a great host, quick to get a hold of and very friendly.

She was very nice about accommodating our vague schedule. The rental is pretty close to the heart of Waikiki. We were able to get around pretty easily by just walking, which was nice because parking in Waikiki can be a nightmare. Speaking of parking, Dana was very helpful in telling us where we could find it. The unit was exactly what we were looking for, a clean place to crash after a day out and about. The one quirk is that there is no actual door to the bathroom. Since I was staying there with my girlfriend, it was a tad awkward.\r\n\r\nOverall, a great little spot to use as a home base if you're looking to check out Waikiki.

As for parking a car, good luck trying to find parking in this area, if you can't then you'll have to cough up $25 for a overnight car stay.

Unit was about a 10 minute walk from Waikiki's main strip which was convenient. The front desk was very helpful with our touristy questions like bus services and destinations. Great location if you're going to Hanauma Bay as it is just blocks from the start of the #22 bus which takes you right there for $2.50! Dana was a great host. Super friendly, prompt,  answered all of our questions and made great recommendations. Studio is clean and has a laundry room in the building. Definitely sufficient for two people. Only thing that would have made it a perfect stay was how bright it got in the morning. For most people, that's a huge plus, and it is for us too... usually. But sometimes when you've been up for hours flying, you just want to crash and wake up on your own and without the help of the sun haha. But! That can be easily solved with a pair of those $3 eye cover things. But bring your own! I looked high and low all over Waikiki and couldn't find a pair! Bottom line, would stay here again and recommend. Convenient, clean, affordable and no frills, just the necessities.

There is a great restaurant across the street called Cheeseburger Waikiki- we managed to hit both happy hours at 3pm and 9pm and had amazing service from Roman. There is also a smart car rental downstairs for $89/day (we didn't do it tho) and there is a 7/11 and ABC Mart downstairs also. So lots to do and many conveniences in the immediate building area.  Also a cute breakfast restaurant and some other sushi spots, etc... \n\nAs for the space- her photos are true and accurate.  It is a good size, comparable to a hotel room.  My husband and I had plenty of room for our luggage and we were very comfortable. The space is clean and decorated with modern comforts.  There is a small fridge so if you are on an extended stay you could fit groceries. She also provides 2 bottles of water as a welcome.  I noticed a kettle, coffee maker, hot plate and some dishes. There is a microwave and toaster oven.  The bathroom is open concept (no door) so if you are traveling with someone, be sure you are comfortable with them! I loved the design.  There is an armoire for clothing and beach/pool towels and bath towels provided as well as extra blanket/linen.  There is also soap/shampoo/conditioner. The unit is run by a window AC unit.  Because of all the windows, it was quite warm during the day.  We opted to open the windows and the warm breeze felt amazing.  The bed is also very comfortable-- it is a real bed (not a futon or pull out).  There is also secure wifi.\n\nThe unit is within a hotel/condo high rise.  Laundry is available on the 5th floor but it is $$ and operates on c/c ($3.75/wash and $2.75/dry)\nThe pool and hot tub is lovely and there are BBQs available too.  Everyone in the building is super friendly.  The elevators are a bit slow but it seems to be a bit of an older building.  I noticed a fitness room and it seems things are slowly but surely being updated throughout the building. \nDon't be put off by the green walls of the building hallway or some of the smells. You get used to it and the unit is just such a gem! It is also super secure- we noticed security cameras everywhere, a key is needed to access the elevator and there is onsite security.  It's great to feel so safe. We loved it and would love to stay again! \n\nThank you for a wonderful stay Dana, for being so easy to communicate with and for being so accommodating :)"},{"_id":"51017680","date":{"$date":"2015-10-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4069429","reviewer_id":"17533950","reviewer_name":"Stefanie","comments":"Dana and Barb were very friendly.

The location is very convenient, walking distance to the conference center, the mall, the beach, etc.  There's 24 hr security and a 7-11 as well as convenience stores just outside.  You can rent cars in the lobby.  The unit looks just like the pictures and is totally adorable.  As others have pointed out, there is no door for the toilet so make sure you're okay with that if you are staying with another person.  If you're showering at night, you may want to do it with the lights off (do-able) because there are gaps in the curtains and the windows are not reflective from the outside.  Keep the windows closed when you're out and about because the room can become rather warm in the afternoons (there's a window AC unit).  \r\n\r\nDana was very accessible, friendly, and helpful and I would gladly work with her again."},{"_id":"51857501","date":{"$date":"2015-10-24T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4069429","reviewer_id":"14064925","reviewer_name":"Maile","comments":"Perfect, quiet place with a wonderful view.

Dana was very attentive and responsive throughout the reservation process, on arrival day, and when we checked out. Couldn't have been easier.

It’s minutes from the beach and a short walk to Waikiki or Ft DeRussy beach, or easy bus ride to further sights (e.g., Iolani Palace, Diamonds Head).  As a bachelor suite, the room itself was the perfect size for a couple looking to explore Honolulu. Inside, the décor is pretty and modern and makes a nice private place to relax after a long day of adventure.  Though we didn't get a chance to use the pool (we were too busy exploring Honolulu), it looked well maintained and like a great place to relax.  Outside, the building itself, which is both a hotel and condo buildling, is a bit dated. However, the staff are very friendly, and someone is always around – night or day - to help you in case your key card doesn’t work.  Dana was also a great host, and communication with her was quick and easy!

Easy walk to Waikiki beach and a 15mins walk to Ala Moana Mall. \n\nWe did appreciate that the unit was furnished,had air conditioner and looked modern with tastefully decorated nice furniture and flooring.

The unit is functional for someone who would be out for most of the time during the day as it can get quite noisy (can hear the lift sounds, other units slamming the door in the morning,siren noises). It was impossible to get the room dark as the curtains only blocked out some light but not all. Not as ideal for anyone who intends to sleep in or catch up on sleep during the day. \n\nThe lift area and corridor leading up to the unit is quite dated and has a stark contrast to the unit's modern look. \n\nOverall, Dana is a good host and responsive and the photos do represent how the unit looks. \n\n"},{"_id":"152325793","date":{"$date":"2017-05-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4069429","reviewer_id":"15143792","reviewer_name":"Kristina","comments":"Had a wonderful time with my guy friend here.

Das Gebäude ist recht groß sowie bekannt, also für Bus und Taxi kein Problem. Es sind ca. 5 min zum Strand (Hilton Hotel). Zur Shopping Meile sowie zum Waikiki Beach dauert es ca. 10min. Direkt gegenüber ist ein ABC-Store sowie ein 7Eleven. Sehr zu empfehlen ist die kleine süße Bäckerei, die direkt an dem Gebäude im 1. Stock leckere Dinge zaubert. Das Zimmer besteht aus einem großen Raum, Badezimmer ist darin, ohne Türe enthalten. Überall sind Fenster und Spiegel, was dem Raum groß wirken lässt und sehr freundlich.\nAllgemeine Tipps für Honolulu:\n-Mietet euch ein Auto, ganz günstig über Expedia und fahrt mit dem zum North Shore hoch. Man kann zwar auch mit dem Bus fahren (Tagesticket 5 Dollar), aber das dauert sehr lange und man weiß eig nie wann genau der nächste Bus kommt. Allgemein sind im Bus Minusgrade. \n-Den Dimond Head kann man nicht immer besteigen, wir konnten leider nicht den Trail hoch, da dieser nur am SA und SO auf war, was sehr ärgerlich war. \n-Auch bei Pearl Harbor ist es von Vorteil, wenn man ein Auto hat, da dies außerhalb der Stadt liegt. Es gibt auch Ausflüge die einen Transfer haben, aber dies muss man rechtzeitig buchen."},{"_id":"211857748","date":{"$date":"2017-11-14T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4069429","reviewer_id":"23363839","reviewer_name":"Swantje","comments":"We had a really pleasant stay, everything was fine!"},{"_id":"212039410","date":{"$date":"2017-11-15T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4069429","reviewer_id":"10112648","reviewer_name":"Annie","comments":"Great space and super close to the main shopping strip and tons of food options!"},{"_id":"212574689","date":{"$date":"2017-11-18T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4069429","reviewer_id":"7002194","reviewer_name":"Sarah","comments":"Great place.

We locked the key in the letterbox downstairs when we left and Dana said it went missing and then tried to charge us $20 US. She was then very rude in demanding the money.

The neighbors slam their doors at night and it woke up us during the night so it’s best to wear ear plugs at night for minimal noise disturbance. Oh and the bed is a Full bed so it might be too small for a larger couple. Maybe Dana can think about investing in a queen size bed.... that would be awesome :)\nAll in all it was a very cute unit and we were satisfied with it.

The location is great and is within walking distance (approximately 1 mile) from Ala Moana as well as other shopping centers, restaurants, and lots of tourist destinations, and within this particular room, the panoramic view is amazing. We particularly loved the Maleko Bakery downstairs on the same floor as the lobby. The owner bakes homemade pastries for the morning and makes pizza at night -- though we only tried the breakfast offerings namely the delicious scones, muffin, and drip coffee.\n\nIf you want to venture outside of Waikiki towards areas like East Oahu and the North Shore you should definitely rent a car. Our friend who also stayed in the Monarch paid $75 for 3 days of parking with in/ out privileges.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that while Dana's condo is newly renovated and stylish, the entire building is much older."},{"_id":"345978638","date":{"$date":"2018-11-06T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4069429","reviewer_id":"12734815","reviewer_name":"James","comments":"Great location, great price, clean and modern space, great communication."},{"_id":"346221119","date":{"$date":"2018-11-07T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4069429","reviewer_id":"217476284","reviewer_name":"Skyeler","comments":"Such a cool space and great location!"},{"_id":"349545203","date":{"$date":"2018-11-17T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4069429","reviewer_id":"201271631","reviewer_name":"Hisa","comments":"立地も部屋の雰囲気も清潔感も抜群に良かったです｡またﾊﾜｲに来たら絶対に泊まりたいと思いました!"},{"_id":"350248750","date":{"$date":"2018-11-18T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4069429","reviewer_id":"217168714","reviewer_name":"Sheng","comments":"Very clean and great location"},{"_id":"350652059","date":{"$date":"2018-11-19T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4069429","reviewer_id":"163908466","reviewer_name":"Edwina","comments":"This cute studio apartment was great for our short stay in Oahu.

It's a great place to stay if you're looking to hang out in the area without having to walk too far to anything. The studio was the perfect size for my friend and I (2 small asian girls) and we had plenty of space for our luggage and to move around. The bedding was super comfortable, the air conditioning made the room very pleasantly cool and the bathroom shower was nice and hot. Not much else you can ask for really! The only thing, which Dana does make very clear, is that parking is a challenge (as it is everywhere in Waikiki). Free parking is not available in the building so you've got to go hunt for it on the main road (which is very difficult) or you pay a \"discounted\" rate of 25 USD a day to the building if you show them the keycard."}]}

Luckily my boyfriend is in the military and is used to sleeping on the ground so he took the bed and I took the futon. The futon wasn’t good for 2 people either, but was fine for just me. There were plenty of towels and pillows for us. The location was outstanding!! We ate breakfast lunch and dinner every day at a different restaurant, all within walking distance. And the famous colorful tile steps you see online are also only a couple blocks away! That made it easy to get there early and get some pics before the crowds showed up.

Its easy to get around but its better to hire a car as it takes about 30 mins to walk into Avalon but once there, its a lovely little place to wonder round and to have a nice meal (we highly recommend Yoda if you like Thai food) there is a little bar called The Mill which is nice to have a few drinks in (Happy hour is 5-6pm).

It's in such a peaceful location and is within 5min walking distance to Paradise beach, the local corner store and restaurants. You are also a 2min car ride away from Avalon - which has a stack of cafes, restaurants, banks, gift stores and a big supermarket.\n\nThe rooms were a great size and the place was super clean. Evelyn personally greeted me upon arrival and had many recommendations for local restaurants and things to do. There was also a nice bottle of wine waiting for us to make us feel extra welcome.\n\nEvelyn's place is the perfect place to hang out and relax or to use as a base to explore all the spectacular northern beaches (e.g. Palm Beach, Whale Beach, Avalon Beach, Newport Beach). I would recommend Evelyn's place to any couples looking for a relaxing bush and beach retreat.

Antonio was extremely welcoming. He met us at the apartment and showed us around the place, pointing out where all the essentials were such as towels etc. He then gave us a map and provided us with some ideas about attractions and restaurants that we could visit. The apartment is exactly as it seems in the photos; every room was very spacious and having two bathrooms (especially for us) was perfect. The location of the apartment is also fantastic. It is across the road from a really good supermarket and is only 5 minute walk at max from the metro station, which meant that access around the whole city was so easy. We were not disappointed by the apartment in any way, and would definitely hope to stay here again, if we were to return Barcelona.

Antonio's friend Ana gave us really good tips which parts of the city to explore - thank's a lot!\n\nThe appartment was spacious and clean and the small balconys were really nice (maybe a little bit chilly in the evening - but we only had like 22 degrees which might be unusual for this time of the year).\n\nWe stayed with 5 people which is okay but the only disadvantages were a) the bathrooms which are next to the bedrooms (thus, the person on the couch cannot reach the bathroom at night without waking the others) and b) the couch itself which is not very comfy. We would not recommend to plan to sleep on the couch longer than a few nights as the mattress sags and might give you sleepless nights...

The apartment and bedroom were spotless and just so cozy during a very cold week. I absolutely loved that my comfy room had its own adjustable thermostat. Daniel's cats are sweet and calm, and quite adorable when they peek their noses outside in the cold snow. You could literally crawl to the metro station from Daniel's place. It's phenomenally located. There's also the bus that goes to the top of the mountain that stops just in front of his place. \r\nFurthermore, you'll sleep like an angel, as Daniel's place is incredibly quiet (being 2 flights of stairs above the street and set-back a bit as well).

He is an outstanding host and works very hard to make sure his guests enjoy their stay. He is very knowledgeable about the city and has great ideas for places to go and things to do. He has many guidebooks and maps he will go through with you, he gave me some great information on the Parc Mont Royal as well as some neighborhood walks. Plus, he makes great coffee and is an excellent chef!   \r\n\r\nThe apartment is very cozy and well equipped. This bedroom is perfect for solo travelers or students, and is an outstanding value. Be aware that it is not large - however it is very comfortable, there is a closet for clothes, and a desk to read or work. With the desk and wifi I was able to get some work done to meet a deadline while I was gone.   \r\n  \r\nThe neighborhood and location are both great. There are shops, restaurants, and a good market all close by. The metro is very close, and Saint-Laurent street and Mont Royal Parc are all just a walk away. I stayed in June for the F1 Grand Prix, and the Plateau neighborhood was a nice change from the normal race crowd and activities. I felt that there were few to no tourists around, so I felt like I was living like a local, which I enjoy. \r\n\r\nComfortable and fun apartment, wonderful host, and a great location. I hope to stay here again!

L'appartement est juste à côté du métro, en 20 minutes à pied on est dans le centre en descendant la rue typique de St Denis et  pour ma part j'ai adoré toutes les librairies de proximité. J'en ai relevé 6 dans un rayon de 15 min autour de l'appart.C'était ma première expérience Airbnb et je suis enchantée. Daniel m'a tout de suite très bien accueillie et mise à l'aise. Il m'a montré le quartier, m'a fait profiter de son expérience de Montréalais. Il est disponible, prévenant et en même temps discret. J'occupais la chambre au bout de l'appartement et j'avais tout ce dont j'avais besoin avec plein de petits détails, notamment décoratifs qui font qu'on se sent chez soi.

This is my first Airbnb experience and he has set the bar high. From the get-go, he was proactive in communicating with his guests. For example, by giving me directions to his place and informing me that the roads were closed due to a festival before I arrived, so that I could plan an alternative route to his place. He even greeted me at the door and gave me a quick tour around Montreal as it was my first time visiting Quebec. Bilingual and affable, Daniel ensures that his guests are comfortably well-settled, especially for English speakers who may have difficulties navigating around Montreal. His apartment is clean and his two cats, Paco and Baboo, are absolutely adorable. Depending on your preferences, Daniel can be a guide and friend, or simply a host if you wish it be. It is his versatile approach to hosting that impresses me the most.\n\nLocation-wise, his place is steps away from the Mont-Royal métro and in the heart of the French Ghetto. Good food is found everywhere. La Banquise and Fameux for Poutine, L'Avenue for brunch, Yokato Yokabai for ramen, pâtisserie kouign aman and plenty more. For bibliophiles, there is a ton of francophone bookshops nearby.\n\nIn short, I had a pleasant stay and got to experience a (very) local taste of Montreal.

We would stay again.  I do have a few suggestions. 1) Too many signs. Does not make people feel welcome 2) You can save electricity by replacing your incandescent bulbs with LED bulbs. Your inefficient window air conditioners could be replaced by heat pumps.  Then, leave them at a constant temperature for further savings. You may be eligible for rebates from New York for the installation.  2) Water can be saved by installing water saving shower head and faucet fitting.  3) If no one is going to clean, perhaps brooms, and cleaning supplies could be left for guests to use. 4) Could trash be taken out periodically? Guests did that from time to time over the week that we stayed. 5) I think putting used toilet paper in a bin in the bathroom is a real issue for most people from the U.S. That bin was never emptied except by myself during our stay.

They're both incredibly funny, kind and helpful. The apartment itself is super clean and the room is very spacious and comfortable. They provide everything you need. Even if something were missing they would make sure that you get it. The first night I mentioned that I'm scared of insects and the next day Ashlee came home and placed baits all over the apartment just in case. In the 6 weeks we stayed with them they helped us with so many different things completely unrelated to their apartment and just made us feel so very welcome and at home. We spent Christmas and New Year's Eve with them and those two are so lovely people, you couldn't wish for better friends and especially not for better AirBnb Hosts.\nDuncan and Ashlee: thank you so much for everything, we are so happy that we got the chance to meet you both."},{"_id":"126688987","date":{"$date":"2017-01-13T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4164487","reviewer_id":"57810347","reviewer_name":"Julieta","comments":"Duncan is a great host, although we didn't meet, he made sure that everything was alright.\nThe apartment is very clean and lovely, as in the photos! \nThank you Duncan!"},{"_id":"131633614","date":{"$date":"2017-02-12T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4164487","reviewer_id":"110570271","reviewer_name":"Emily","comments":"Such a lovely house, that is in a great location.. quiet suburb but so close to the city!

Both community bathrooms were inundated with Stachybotrys Mold. To your average pedestrian  it goes unnoticed beyond any apparent 'moldy towel' smell after a shower but the ramifications are extensive and dangerous...beyond concerning. Additionally, the private room (1) I stayed in had significant water damage (I will upload images if prompted) making for an even more uneasy inhabitable feeling during my time. Luckily, Im a NYer back on business so I had resources and family to reach out to for showering purposes during the week in-between running around for business obligations. The next guests might not be so lucky and I'd hate for their entire experience to be ruined due to the host' negligence.

Il reste néanmoins attentif à la réception de ses hôtes (même si nous concernant il y a eu un petit raté, compte tenu que nous sommes arrivés à 8h dans un appartement vide et avons été pris d'un doute en voyant toutes les chambres utilisées). \r\nL'appartement a un petit côté auberge espagnole, avec les allées-venues chaque jour d'hôtes de toutes nationalités. Sur quatre jours nous n'avons eu aucun problème de cohabitation, nos voisins étant majoritairement des couples - chacun disposant des parties communes avec respect et indépendance. Une femme de ménage passe d'ailleurs régulièrement préparer les chambres (5 en tout). Les photos sont bien fidèles à la réalité. \r\nNous n'avons finalement pas pris la chambre 1 : on y entend tous les bruits de circulation (murs fins, fenêtre simple vitrage) et elle communique par une cloison coulissante à une autre chambre. Préférez la chambre 5 (la meilleure selon Mario himself) plus au calme et qui bénéficie d'une meilleure exposition (+ accès à la terrasse, véritable atout j'imagine l'été), sans compter sa proximité avec la SDB et les WC (non négligeable quand c'est à partager avec d'autres hôtes). Savon et shampoing ne sont pas fournis. Des plans de la ville bien pratiques avec tous les spots touristiques sont en revanche en accès libre. \r\nLe petit déjeuner est sans intérêt : il est proposé dans un café quelconque (ambiance bar PMU) situé à 5 min., en échange d'un petit coupon qui donne droit à une formule très basique. Nous n’avons pas utilisé la cuisine, mais elle semble fonctionnelle et on trouve facilement des supermarchés aux alentours. \r\nL’emplacement à proximité de la rue Sainte-catherine, et l’accès direct en métro depuis l’aéroport en font un lieu de choix. On a eu un petit coup de coeur pour le très local Cafe Guedes situé à qqs rues, qui propose de petits sandwichs avec lanières de porc ou fromage de brebis. \r\nLe seul petit bémol à noter (et uniquement valable en temps de grand froid) est l’absence de vrai chauffage dans les chambres. Seul un mini chauffage électrique faisait office de source de chaleur ; il faut sinon se débrouiller avec les couvertures supplémentaires mises à disposition. \r\nMais on oublie vite ce désagrément devant la gentillesse de Mario, prompt à vous répondre par mail pour vous proposer des itinéraires de visite de la ville ou des suggestions de restaurant. Pour dire, une attention qui m’a beaucoup touchée : il avait même laissé en notre absence un mot sur la table du salon accompagné de petites friandises pour souhaiter la bonne année à ses hôtes airbnb !

So I felt quite happy when I discovered Mario's Place and assured my stay there for 4 nights. The apartment consists of 5 guest rooms, a living room with a small, but useful library, a large table and a TV set, a well-equipped kitchen, 2 bathrooms and a small backyard veranda where you can sit and drink and chat outside. The rooms are spacey and furnished efficiently and with good taste. \r\nIncluded in my arrangement was also a voucher for breakfast in a nearby café, a very nice coffeeshop indeed, with very friendly staff and great croissants and pastries. I loved it.\r\nI enjoyed my stay at Mario's Place, but I have one restriction:  My only complaint is due to the fact that rooms 1 \u0026 2 are facing the main street, a noisy street where hundreds of busses pass and also lots of trucks. Due to a respiratory problem, I need to sleep with open windows, and as I had drawn room no. 1,  this meant that I had busses and trucks almost inside my room all night.  I contacted Mario and tried to change to another room, but since this wasn't possible, I had to cope with the street noise.\r\nIt might be a good idea to inform people beforehand that rooms 1 \u0026 2 should only be booked by people who have lesser problems with street noise.\r\nApart from this complaint, I really enjoyed my stay. If I drew one of rooms 3 to 5 next time, I would consider returning for another try.\r\nThank you, Mario!\r\n"},{"_id":"77095589","date":{"$date":"2016-05-30T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4178954","reviewer_id":"51000651","reviewer_name":"Ryan","comments":"While we never met Mario, his place is incredible and highly recommended to stay at.

Müthiş bir temizlik yok onu söylemek isterim. Yani bal dök yala değil. Yani ne çok iyi ne çok kötü, özellikle banyo kısmı. Nevresimler belki temizdi ama artık yeni nevresimlerin alınma vakti gelmişti. Hepsi lekeliydi, ayrıca bizimle aynı evde kalan misafirler de aynı şeyi söylediler. Yastık kılıfları, nevresimler, havluların hepsinde lekeler var. Evin 2 odası ( no1 ve no 2 ) cadde tarafında. Benim gibi uykusu hassas olanların mutlaka yanlarında balmumu tarzı kulak tıkaçlarını getirmelerini tavsiye ederim. Ev sahibini hiç görmedim, ama bu çok da önemli değil. Şaşırtıcı olan güzel bir şey vardı o da; eve çok yakın ( 2 dakika yürüyüş mesafesinde ) bir kahvaltı mekanında ücretsiz kahvaltı alabiliyor olmanız. Örneğin ben laktoz ve gluten içerikli yiyemediğim için salamlı çırpılmış omlet  sipariş edebildim. Süper de lezzetliydi. Yanında taze sıkılmış portak suyu da ikramdı ( normalde ücretli ), bir de espresso aldım. Hiçbir ücret ödemedim. Erkek arkadaşım ful kahvaltı yedi, ekmeği tereyağı salam, marmelat vs. Sadece portakal suyu yerine limonata aldı (ücretsiz ). Özetle kahvaltı opsiyonlu bir yer olması ve bunun ücretsiz olması çok güzel. Evin konumu merkezi bir yerde, hemen yakınında bir alışveriş merkezi ve çevrede alışveriş sokakları var. Restoranlar da oldukça (Website hidden by Airbnb) arabayla gelmemize rağmen heryeri yürüyerek gezdik. \nÇok pimpirikliyseniz yanınıza evden bir yastık kılıfı getirebilirsiniz :)"},{"_id":"289366731","date":{"$date":"2018-07-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4178954","reviewer_id":"586531","reviewer_name":"Angela","comments":"I was only there for one night, but except for some street noise in room 1, which was easily resolved in me changing into a vacant single bed room, it was a fairly pleasant stay.

Alaina left us a sweet note with yummy homemade cookies and a bottle of wine, we felt more than welcome to stay in her apartment. The room is clean and neat, and the towels are soft with freshing smell. We had the entire apartment for all the time we stayed there, it was quiet and comfortable. The area is safe and the apartment is about 3 minutes walking distance to the subway station, it is easy to get to Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens.

But the neighborhood was very quite and safe. It was safe for me to walk alone at 10 PM  there.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived, she was very welcome. Her brother helped me to carry my luggage upstair to my room. The room was pretty big for 2 people. But I felt the bed sheet was not as clean as I expected and the odor suggests that it has been used by other person staying before me. Because it is already midnight, I didn't asked her to change it. However, in the morning I told her about the sheet and she apologized. She asked me to put the sheet in the kitchen and she said she will change it.\r\n\r\nThere was also a bit problem with the water. When was I in the shower, the water suddenly stopped. But luckily I almost finished my shower. So it doesn't matter.\r\n\r\nI was going to stay there for 2 days, but a friend told me I could stay at his place because it is much closer to the place I took the English test.

Las lineas N-Q que son las que hay que tomar durante nuestra estancia, no dejaron de tener alguna incidencia, no se si fue Spring Break o qué.\n\n El transporte en general de Nueva York en cuanto a información al viajero es muy decadente, con información contradictoria, en algunos casos. \n\nLa guinda de todo, fue llegar al apartamento a las 12:45am y que una chica que trabaja para la dueña (a la que nunca conocimos) y que dijera que tenia que llamar a su jefa porque estábamos haciendo el check-out tarde e insinuando que nos podían cargar algo de dinero.

It also have really nice restaurants just a few blocks away. House is clean and easy to access. There was always paper towels, toilet papers, clean towels and hand soap available. It's great for traveling on a budget but there's always room for improvement. \n\nCons: First night without a/c or fan and only one window could be open. The third night the a/c wasn't working properly (due to rain going inside the unit), I ended up turning it off and going back to the window option. There are skylights between the bedrooms and if one leave the lights on, the other room also illuminates (not fun when you're trying to sleep). I never had the chance to meet Funda, which I think would have been nice. A nail head is poking out of the floor by one of the windows, I stepped on it but luckily noticed it on time without getting hurt.\n\nThe inside of the house is basically multiple rooms that are rented individually, this could be a pro or a con, depending on your taste on sharing spaces with other guests (e.g. having to wait for 3 or more people to use the bathroom before you can shower)."},{"_id":"82249238","date":{"$date":"2016-06-27T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4211510","reviewer_id":"23958301","reviewer_name":"Pei (Elain)","comments":"Me and my bf stayed in the room for the weekend.

Empiezo por las cosas negativad, tuvimos problemas edilicios, al llegar el techo del cuarto estaba a punto de caerse y a las pocas horas se desprendieron muchos paneles. Lo repararon el mismo día y no nos causó daños porque no estábamos en ese momento en el cuarto. Luego el co host nos quiso mudar de cuarto para pintar sin poder especificarnos por cuanto tiempo. Le expresamos que no queriamos mudarmos porque era mucho trastorno y pospuso el trabajo de pintura sin inconvenientes. El segundo día no hubo agua caliente en todo el día, tuve que bañarme con agua fría. Hacia la noche estaba resuelto. Nos desapareció mucha comida de la heladera que teníamos preparada para una noche y el almuerzo siguiente. Aparentemente la tiró personal de limpieza provisorio que trabajó en ausencia del co host. Nos recompenzaron económicamente, aunque con una pequeña suma que no llegó a cubrir los costos y el esfuerzo de haber cocinado y luego tener que salir muy tarde a la noche a comprar. En el anuncio dice que está a 20 minutos de Manhattan, pero son 30. La limpieza y organización del lugar en general fueron muy buenas, la ubicación está muy bien, el barrio es pintoresco y parece ser seguro, no tuvimos problemas.

If you're ok with a hostel-type situation, go for it. The room is huge (there are two couches!) and the house is immaculate. \n\nI was here for a week on business and the people in the room next to me (there were five or six people) were so loud late into the night (after 11-11:30ish). They slammed doors, stomped, yelled, etc. I didn't mind it on the weekend, but it was obnoxious on the weeknights. Fortunately when I contacted Funda she spoke with them. They were quiet.\n\nThis also meant sharing a single bathroom between 6-7 people. That can be problematic.\n\nMy last complaint is that, unless the neighboring room is unoccupied, you may not have the luxury of sleeping in the dark. There is, for some strange reason, an opaque window between the two bedrooms. My neighbors were night owls (whereas I had to go to bed for work) so there wasn't a single night that they were there when I was able to sleep in the dark. I had to put a shirt over my head.\n\nLike I said, Funda and Nelson were wonderfully. I would absolutely recommend the place for those who appreciate cleanliness and don't mind a very communal environment.

But it is very basic and you should bear in mind there are a lot of other airbnb guests in the building , in particular next door is a room for up to 6 people which can make it quite loud and crowded if occupied.

If you'd like a detailed description please read on! I tried my best to make this a totally impartial view of my stay!\n\nThe Good:\n\n1. The Neighbourhood:\n\n I couldn't be happier with the location of this Air B\u0026B is. The train is a 10 minute walk from the house and it runs 24/7. There are lots of great  coffee shops and restaurants within walking distance all with great food and prices! \n\n2. The Price:\n\n Much more affordable for a trip to NYC. We were able to stay more days with this house without breaking the bank! \n\nThe Bad:\n\n1. It's Shared Living:\n\n The simple room is next to the Astoria Suite (which holds up to 5 people) this also means you'll be sharing a bathroom, hallway, and house with more than the guests in your party. Get ready for bathroom wait times and noise from the hall. Our neighbours happened to be 5 teenagers who liked to indulge in the night life.\n\n2. Broken Amenities:\n\nI understand it's hard to keep up with a big house... The problem here came with the doors and the toilet. All the doors in the house don't shut properly (due to age and damage) and the toilet barely works... The flusher was falling out. There were some holes in the floor and holes In the windows (which caused problems when it poured rain one night.)\n\n3. Not the cleanest place:\n\nThe floors were dirty. The bed was stained. The carpet was filthy and the couch was musty. We were able to handle it as we were just sleeping in the room but still we were expecting cleaner from the pictures. The carpet is also covering a whole in the floorboards. \n\nThe Ugly:\n\n1. ANTS???\n\nWe found an ant on the bed... Then another.... And another... Soon we realized the room was covered in ants. The first night we slept uneasy... Not even going under the sheets due to the amount of ants. We would come back to the room to find ants all over the table and furniture... So we had to be extra careful about leaving food and garbage. A few ant traps could fix this problem.\n\n2. A Weird shared window.\n\nSo there are glass bricks at the top of the ceiling which are shared between both the simple room and suite. If one light is on both rooms are lit. So we had a sleepless night when the neighbours kept their light on. I'm not sure why this window is even there... It could be fixed with a curtain.\n\n\nIn Summary:\n\nThe place is great if you want a simple place to stay. If you're looking to be in town for longer than a week though may be a bit tougher."},{"_id":"317799911","date":{"$date":"2018-09-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4211510","reviewer_id":"193139307","reviewer_name":"Annabelle","comments":"Other rooms in this home are rented out to other airbnb residents so you get to interact with a lot of other people from other places.

Convenient to the subway (four blocks away),  shopping (Key Foods is one block away), with numerous restaurants and shops everywhere in the neighborhood, but yet very quiet inside, it was the perfect place for our NYC stay. To cut down on our expenses, we were able to cook our dinners using Leo's kitchen equipment.  In fact we kind of became like true New Yorkers taking the subway home from the city in the evening, hitting Key Foods for groceries and not sitting down  to eat until 8-9pm!

It's a good thing I asked Leo in advance if he has a coffee maker, because he does not. Fortunately, I have a little drip thing that goes over the cup, which is easy to take with me. Otherwise there are lots of places close by to get coffee (I just like to have mine first thing in the morning). \r\n\r\nLeo was very nice and helpful.

Leo was out of town but he answered really fast all txt and e-mails, gave us clear explanations, was helpful and cared if everything was OK. He replied my first inquiry in 30 minutes (other people took 8 days to reply!). The apartment was clean, cozy, with this funky decoration we loved, and it was very quiet (no noise from street or neighbors). It’s exactly as in the pictures but a little bit bigger. Clean sheets and tons of towels, comfy bed, super-comfy couch. Very conveniently located, close to 2 subway stations. Safe neighborhood. \r\nAstoria is a great area, very lively and authentic (not a touristic spot), a real ethnic melting pot!. People seem to know each other on the streets and stores, like in old time neighborhoods. My recommendation is go towards north 30th Ave instead of Steinway St. 30th Ave has more cafes, restaurants, bakeries, fruit and vegetable stores, flower stores, etc. I think Astoria has a lot of things to explore. Great place to sense how other real newyorkers (not just manhattanites) live everyday life. Though it’s close to Manhattan, it’s a peace oasis compared with the craziness and fast speed of Manhattan. Good place to chill out!\r\nOverall a great experience! I highly recommend Leo, his apartment and Astoria. I will definitely repeat!       \r\n"},{"_id":"8108787","date":{"$date":"2013-10-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"423275","reviewer_id":"9314564","reviewer_name":"Özge","comments":"The reservation was canceled 3 days before arrival.

By ferry boat you can get to Eminonu, Karakoy and even to Uskudar (in Asian part of Istanbul). Price is the same as the bus.\r\nNext to the entrance door there is a small grocery store where you can buy everything you need. \r\nPinar is extremely good host and if we had some questions she promtly gave the answer.\r\nSo we highly recommend Pinar's apartment."},{"_id":"67507372","date":{"$date":"2016-03-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4241384","reviewer_id":"9463207","reviewer_name":"Hanna","comments":"Pınars Apartment ist groß, sauber, zentral gelegen, voll ausgestattet.

(2) Die kleine Wohnung hat nur eine mäßige Küchenausstattung: Kochen kann man durchaus, aber man sollte von aufwändigeren Gerichten absehen.

My advice would be to check out the forthcoming schedule for the theatre in advance of your visit as there may well be something on that you wouldn't want to miss.\r\n\r\nThe apartment itself is full of character, consisting mainly of one long, wooden-floored room with windows to the front and the rear courtyard, and a bedroom off to one side at the front. There are antiques, an eclectic collection of photographs adorning the walls and even a rocking chair for when you just want to sit down and read (although our schedule was a little too packed to allow for that).  You also have access to a covered balcony, where, when the sun came out on Monday afternoon, we enjoyed an excellent pastrami sandwich from Katz's Deli, which is a just few minutes walk away and a definite \"must\" for anyone visiting the area.\r\n\r\nThe location is very good, with a range of excellent restaurants, coffee shops and bars nearby.  A few for particular mention (apart from Katz's) would include Saxon + Parole at 316 Bowery, Bluebird Coffee Shop on 1st and 1st, where they do a perfect \"flat white\" and is just a few doors down from Prune, where we enjoyed an excellent brunch, and the Clinton Street Baking Company, which serves -  what we all agreed - were the best pancakes we'd ever had.\r\n\r\nWe arrived on Halloween so understandably the party was in full swing outside and continued well into the wee small hours of Saturday. Earplugs came in handy!\r\n\r\nI always enjoy visiting New York and particularly so on this occasion with my wife and grown up daughters. The fact that Lorcan was more than happy to allow us to leave our bags in the apartment until later in the afternoon (we had an evening flight) meant that we were able to make the utmost of our all too brief visit.

Right across the street are 3 of the best restaurants in NYC, one of them (Xi'an)  visited by both Andrew Zimmern and Anthony Bourdain. Lorcan's speakeasy is another story. Located on the 1st floor, William Barnacle Tavern is one of the highest rated bars in the area as well. On Tuesday nite there were traditional Irish musicians (about a dozen) who gathered around a table and played some awesome music. Jeannie and Lorcan are the most gracious of people.

Within one block we had the best shrimp tacos, blueberry rhubarb soup, ramen, pizza, crepes in the window just below from an actual Frenchman... and that's just food! They were lovely hosts- knew the whole neighborhood and told us where to find shoes for my daughter right on the next block since she'd ruined hers on the trip.  The place itself was full of history and character- and a floor-thru! The deck out back was beautiful- wish we could've stayed longer- will definitely be back if they'll have us! \nAs far as amenities go it's a full apartment with kitchen, full bath- they even left a bottle of wine and an extra toothbrush. Plenty of blankets and there was not only the sofa-bed, pull out bed and a queen in the bedroom there was also an air mattress and plenty of space to use it. I'd say more but if you want a convenient NY neighborhood (it's a couple blocks to the 6 at Astor place or a couple more to almost any other train at west 4 or e. Houston).  If my kids were very small Id have been worried about them with the antiques but it was perfect for us- could leave the teenager to sleep while I took the youngers to the bakery or to get coffee (Porto Rico importing company is on this block- the OG coffee shop!) all in all so glad they took our last minute reservation request- my kids got to see some of downtown and it was easy to pop up to midtown to see the touristy stuff they wanted and come back to rest ourselves to go out someplace awesome for dinner.

Lorcan and his wife were thoughtful hosts welcoming us and giving us a brief history of the location.  The area is why we chose this apt.  The area is quirky, funky with great bars, restaurants and shops.  \r\n\r\nThe apartment is clean but not very furnished.  We didn't think of this beforehand and the reviews don't mention it.  This means that there isn't any sitting or lounging after a long day sight seeing. Just a long wood table and chairs and a rocking chair. If you are using the beds in the main area there is no where to sit. A couch and a comfortable chair would help.  We couldn't really spend any down time in the apartment so any time spent in the apartment you have to stand or relax on a bed.  \r\n\r\nThe kitchen is functional but you really aren't going to do much cooking.  The bathroom is old but clean.  My wife prefers more modern bathrooms and a bit of luxury.  A note to Lorcan, consider a box or 2 of Kleenex. \r\n\r\nIt should also be pointed out that though it is considered a first floor walkup, there are 3 flights of stairs to walk up.

Siamo stati nel suo appartamento per una settimana; il nostro gruppo era di quattro sessantenni (tre amiche e un amico). L’appartamento, il quartiere, tutto molto gradevole. L’appartamento è come nella foto, il salone molto grande ci ha permesso di dormire in tre, in tre letti separati, senza disturbarci, mentre in quarto amico ha potuto avere a disposizione la stanza. Il clima mite ci ha permesso di usare un poco anche la terrazza. Ci è sembrata una vera casa newyorchese, in posizione che ci permetteva di muoverci anche a piedi, ad es. fino a Union Square. Servita da due stazioni della subway piuttosto vicine, come pure da bus. \r\nLorcan ci ha anche guidato in una visita al suo piccolo teatro di famiglia, ci ha raccontato di attori, e non solo, che l’hanno frequentato, del periodo del proibizionismo….\r\nUn problema che si è manifestato in bagno il secondo giorno è stato prontamente risolto coll’intervento dell’idraulico (Lorcan abita nello stesso palazzo ed è, ripetiamo, molto disponibile).\r\nIl quartiere tranquillo ha negozi aperti fino a tarda sera, come pure posti dove mangiare qualcosa, e ristoranti. La prima sera arrivati tardi, siamo andati a cercare qualcosa da mangiare e eravamo stupiti della gente che passeggiava per quelle strade, del clima tranquillo e a misura d’uomo.\r\nDifetti? L’altro aspetto di un quartiere molto frequentato , da giovani e non solo, è che la notte non è molto silenziosa, soprattutto di sabato), ma ciò non ci ha impedito comunque di riposare. Un consiglio? Sostituire il frigorifero che, piuttosto antiquato, è molto rumoroso e si trova nella sala dove ci sono dei letti.\r\nConclusione? Ci siamo trovati proprio bene. Ci piacerebbe tornare (se magari cambi il frigorifero…) e consiglieremo l’appartamento di Lorcan agli amici."},{"_id":"51947203","date":{"$date":"2015-10-25T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4241486","reviewer_id":"7196599","reviewer_name":"Antonio","comments":"Nuestra estancia en la casa de Lorcan ha sido muy buena.

Its a long knock-thru, with polished boards and a long table with bench and chairs to one side. Galley kitchen was good enough to cook Christmas dinner for 9 people, but serviceable rather than stylish. The helpful thing was that if we needed something, Lorcan simply pulled it out of his kitchen. The 4 poster in the bedroom creeks and the bathroom tiles have seen better days, but that is all part of the charm. If you need 5 star chrome, this is mot a good choice, but for us, it was perfect. We had three adult children on the trundle bed and an inflatable sleeping in the living room, which means that everyone gets up at the same time - no hardship. There is street noise - sirens, trucks, and New Yorkers socialising on the street, 3 flrs below. We had our windows open, as it was unseasonably warm.  It is the Lower East Side, so the noise goes with the territory. Location is superb, convenient to transport, snd walking distance to shopping. Lots of deli's and coffee shops (again, goes with the neighbourhood, and a big plus). No soft chairs or sofas for watching TV, but we didn't turn it on once - too busy enjoying NYC.\n\nIt is bohemian, and hence perfect for the area, and in my view a perfect AirBnB. \n\nWe would stay again, for so many reasons - the apt, Lorcan and Gennie, the district.

Our favourite thing about the apartment was the nice big kitchen, which was equipped with good cookware and a nice little espresso machine. There were many negative aspects about our stay. When we first arrived, there was no information about internet or other infos, so we had to search for an internet cafe to be able to get in contact with Catherine. We then had to wait quite some time before getting an answer -- an overall frustrating experience. We stayed in the flat for a month in the winter and had to go up precarious steps each day. It was our responsibility to shovel the steps and remove the ice, but no shovel was provided. Another major issue was the broken window in the bedroom. It was covered with plastic, which kept the heat in very well, but it didn't block any of the noise coming from the street, which was a problem some nights. Another thing to keep in mind is that only one set of keys was provided. This was quite inconvenient for us because we were 2 people. In general, whenever we had an issue, we were told to solve it ourselves. We managed to figure things out in the end, and the location close to the metro and nice restaurants made up for many of our frustrations.

My friends and I arrived late in the day and Anderson met us downstairs. The house is spacious, with two bathrooms, which was very nice since I was sharing with 2 men \u0026 2 boys. Its only a few minutes walk to the beach, Ted's bakery and you can lounge in the hammock on the lanai. \nThe downside; my friend and his son were sharing a room which had bedbugs. We called Anderson first thing in the AM and he said he would bring over a new mattress, mattress protector and pillows. He did replace the mattress \u0026 pillows. He apologised for the bedbugs, we appreciated that he came out took care of the mattress, but my friend and his son were covered with bites, which put a damper on their trip. They also did not want to sleep in the room again and we had 3 more nights.\nAnother downside was the bottom half of the house was having repairs and the workers shut the water off in the house.  We only found out when we went to take a shower after a day at the beach. They did their best getting the water back on, but it took awhile and we ended up being late for a show in Waikiki. \n\nAnderson and his family were very nice, he even said that we could have our music a little loud because he was working on soundproofing his home, its just with the bedbugs, I feel a discount could have been offered.

Must try!\n\nThe roosters were slightly annoying being quite loud throughout the night but not so bad once the windows were closed. \n\nLarge living area and communal space with a well stocked kitchen. \n\nThanks for a great time!"},{"_id":"252249990","date":{"$date":"2018-04-09T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4294289","reviewer_id":"6492882","reviewer_name":"Dominique","comments":"Large, comfortable, cozy place, nice large deck, great location close to the beach, nice modern washer/drier, and plenty of parking for our 3 rental cars.

It is located on the inner side (not ocean side) of Kamehameha Highway. However, a quick cross of the highway at the driveway and a 3-5 min. walk and you are at Sunset Beach. You cannot see (or hear) the ocean from the house but it is hard to be the location. Ted’s Bakery is just down the highway, about a 4 min. walk as well. We enjoyed numerous meals there and the food is top quality!  Nice to have that so close. We stayed on the top level of the house. It was nice to have a personal bedroom for each of the three of us. We definitely appreciated the space. Amenities are basic but what we needed. Food cannot be left out as the ants will come. There is no A/C. It is best to not be in the house from say noon till sundown as it will be quite hot. However, opening the windows and bringing in the evening air is sufficient (we stayed the first week of November.) The occasional rain showers also helped to mediate the heat inside. Roosters begin their morning chatter around 4:30 am. Earplugs are a must if you are used to a more quiet sleeping environment. We had a few leaks in the roof on a day when the rains were heavier. We just moved the sofa out of the drip line and all was fine. We drove a lot around the island and this home was a great starting place for our day trips. Would definitely recommend this home for a stay in the North Shore."},{"_id":"405854256","date":{"$date":"2019-01-27T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4294289","reviewer_id":"229760840","reviewer_name":"Whitney","comments":"Great spot on the North Shore.

There is plenty of room for everyone. It’s clean but there were a couple of items of concern. There were a lot of small stains on the couch. Don’t know if it’s people being careless with drinks or what, but nothing a slip cover couldn’t fix. We think the residence is on septic because there are signs in the bathrooms asking not to flush toilet paper, which seemed odd. I’m used to this in 3rd world countries, but not Hawaii. At first I chalked it up to the house being on the North Shore, but then we had guests over that are locals and they even commented on the signs and found it strange. \n\nThis is on the top floor of a house and I think the bottom floor is also an AirBnB along with another home on the property.  The first night the guests downstairs, some young men, were being very loud. I wasn’t sure if they were the permanent residents so I didn’t complain to the host. \n\nLastly, even though the house is setback from the road, since you have to leave the windows open for ventilation you will hear cars driving by all night. \n\nBUT the house is a 5 minute walk from Sunset Beach. There is a Foodland 2.3 miles away and Ted’s Bakery is about 100 yards away. It’s a GREAT location! And again it’s very roomy!!"}]}

She greeted me with a hug upon arrival, gave me a key, explained a few rules about using your own toilet paper and dusting sand off outside, and that was it. I had 1-3 roomies (all of them from different countries like Japan, China, Taiwan, and Brazil) at any given time as people shipped in and out, and this is one way I made friends during my stay. :) Everyone was respectful and friendly, always saying \"hello\" if not having a full-out chat session.\nFor a highly reasonable price per day, I had a sectioned-off, semi-private space with a bed, a window, shelving, bath and beach towels, a small closet space (which was more than I needed), access to a kitchen with a stove and refrigerator, a bathroom with a shower, washers and dryers downstairs (costs $1.25 in quarters), and even snorkel gear left behind by previous guests. I was a 10-minute stroll from the grocery store (Food Pantry), a less-than-10-minute stroll from Waikiki Beach, and a 15-minute jog from Ala Moana Beach Park. \nAltogether, it was a wonderful, chill \"temporary home life.\" If you don't mind sharing a small apartment, if you are open to intercultural experiences, and if you abhor spending so much money on hotels and want to stay in Hawaii longer, this is for you. ;) Aloha!"},{"_id":"42341393","date":{"$date":"2015-08-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4297256","reviewer_id":"39197527","reviewer_name":"Hiroko","comments":"Really enjoyed the stay at Tomoko's place!

I was looking for a place at a reasonably cheap price *honestly* also reasonably clean/ethically exterminated. I did rent for a reasonable inexpensive price, with Tomoko, which helped keep travel cost low in Waikiki, while travelling solo. So here is honesty, while I was there for 2 weeks; I experienced a considerable amount of roaches, bathroom mold, and poor air circulation and barely bearable heat. Also, I was falsely accused of smoking \"weed\". Because of the poor air circulation and uncomfortable night sweats for the first four days of my vacation, I became extremely sick for 3-days of my trip. I stayed in for a day to get better with cold meds and Gay Hulu, when that's when she started text harassing me with the weed accusation. She apologized, which was gratifying, but it was still a pointless frustration, as I was super sick and in no way in the mood to feel the harassment and insecurity of my stay in that dump *seriously, I hate to say that about a roof over my head, but really there were curtains up, as space/bed dividers*. Don't get me wrong, I think Tomoko is a great person. I just feel that there could be better management. Like, maybe, a) having cleaners come in once a week to clean the apartments; since there is such high traffic with people moving in and out. b) Labelling and dating food/throwing out/composing old food *there was smell* c) deep cleaning the bathrooms/curtains once a month d) and PLEASE have some form of air circulation; a FAN... was so helpful once received.\r\nFinally, I will say, my first week I met some of the most fantastic ladies who would will be my friends forever and I would have never had that experience if I had not rented space with Tomoko.

However, he was out of town during our one night stay but his wife stayed up late to receive us as we had a late arrival, which was much appreciated. The home is situated in a secluded area, sort of like a forest. It's about a 5-10 mins drive from the main road and not much to eat after dark. I wish we knew as our family was hungry when we arrived and it was just too far to drive back out to search for food. So bring your own supplies as they have a fully functional kitchen from what I can see.\n\nThe home is quite large, but not the cleanest nor is it updated. The fourth 'bedroom' is an area blocked off by a screen. Sofas were made into beds in the living room which served as a bedroom and one of our occupants was looking for more privacy and wanted to sleep downstairs on a couch but said it was not very clean. \n\nAlso, there are holes in the screens and mosquitoes were coming into the house. So you will need to bring bug spray. I saw AC in the listing, but there's no AC offered. And Leon's wife mentioned electricity is very expensive so we didn't bother searching for the AC.\n\nThe dog was friendly and stayed in the porch and guarded us throughout the night. When we woke up in the morning, we realize the view from the deck was quite nice. We didn't really do much other than shower and sleep since it was a short stay. Also, bathrooms weren't the nicest. Could use some cleaning.

He allowed us to check in earlier upon request. The description and photos are very accurate. \n\nOur group wanted to be together and since we were on a limited budget this really helped us out.

It features a nice decoration and furniture that makes you feel like you’re in your own place.\r\nThe kitchen was fully equipped, the bathroom was nice and clean but a bit small to be used for more than one person at a time, and the bedroom was very cool with great views of Manhattan. The apartment was always warm and we never felt cold (even with all the snow we had!) \r\nJanine is the perfect host. She helped us out with everything we may need at all times. She lent two bikes and provided with a bunch of useful tips about the neighborhood, transport, where to buy, what to do… Also she left food for us the first night when we arrived so late; she had a lot of special details with us.\r\nVery convenient location with two subway stations nearby that allow you to go downtown in barely 30 minutes and other destinations really quick. The street is very quiet and the only noise you hear is some airplane noise when they occasionally fly too low above the city, but we didn’t find that disturbing.\r\nBrooklyn is a very cool place to stay, it has a lot of places to visit and things to do, and this apartment is very convenient for visiting it on feet. \r\n\r\nWe fully recommend this place to stay :D"},{"_id":"25495197","date":{"$date":"2015-01-18T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4334446","reviewer_id":"2481445","reviewer_name":"Chris","comments":"The apartment was extremely nice.  The pictures do not do it justice!  The bedroom is spacious with a very comfortable bed and fantastic views of lower Manhattan from the windows.  The kitchen is well equipped, lovely modern bathroom with good shower and generally lots of storage space for suitcases and clothes throughout the apartment.  The essentials provided are far better than essentials - lovely towels and toiletries etc.  During our trip it was very cold but the apartment was always toasty warm! Whilst the apartment is described as the third floor of a house it is private with a lockable door - guests just share a common staircase (like any apartment building). \r\n\r\nThe hosts were very welcoming, helpful and friendly.  I would definitely recommend this apartment to anybody wanting to visit NYC.\r\n\r\nThe neighborhood was great.  The main street, 7th Ave, is a vibrant area (without being overbearing) with lots of niche delis, stores, restaurants and bars.  We ate on 7th a number of times and weren't disappointed once.  The is also lots to do in the locale - Brooklyn Museum, Prospect Park and a great Flea Market on Saturdays to name a few.\r\n\r\nThe subway is a 5-10min walk from the apartment and then a quick ride into Manhattan."},{"_id":"26135630","date":{"$date":"2015-02-04T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4334446","reviewer_id":"13447571","reviewer_name":"Sally","comments":"I had a lovely visit in the cozy 1 bedroom Park Slope, Brooklyn.

The apartment was even better than imagined from the description and photos and other reviews; we couldn't have been happier with the place. It was actually quite large and well appointed both with useful items and tasteful decoration. \r\n\r\nBoth Janine and Anita were so welcoming and friendly; when we were late arriving Janine checked in to see if we were ok. My partner was getting over the flu at the time and had come from Switzerland to meet me; Anita brought soup and kleenex up for him the second night. Other than that, we barely saw them and felt like we had a private, magical safe haven in Brooklyn, all to ourselves.\r\n\r\nA couple notes of interest: previous reviews have mentioned that the unit it open to the internal staircase. This has been changed and there is a new door that has been installed to ensure privacy. Also - the bed and sheets are fabulous. Very comfortable and we slept like babies. The shower is quite luxurious and has great water pressure. Everything is VERY clean, and the place was warm (which is saying a lot since it was in the teens at night in February). \r\n\r\nLocation is excellent; 20 minutes to Manhattan, and plenty of great shops and restaurants and character in Brooklyn to keep you entertained for days. I especially recommend the Saturday Flea Market.\r\n\r\nDefinitely book this place; you won't be sorry.

Janine had air condition installed during our stay as it was hot. Wi-Fi connection is excellent and so are the TV services available. \r\n\r\nWe arrived rather late in the evening and Janine waited for us, made us feel welcome and showed us around the apartment. There were maps and magazines with events in the neighborhood and in the city waiting for us on the desk and we were given advice on where to go and which events were worth visiting. Generally Janine stayed out of our way but was happy to chat, help and answer any questions - the best a host can do. She checked in with us every couple of days and even offered to book our airport transport at the end of our stay. Some construction work had to be done in the apartment while we were staying in it and Janine went out of her way to ensure it was done at a time when we were outside so it didn’t disturb us.\r\n\r\nThe location in Brooklyn is excellent and just a quick subway ride from Manhattan (F and G trains run a short walk down the street). The area around the apartment has a nice number of shops and restaurants – it’s lively, but doesn’t get crowded or too loud. \r\n\r\nWe are so happy we chose this accommodation - photos don't do justice to the actual feel of the apartment - it was cherry on the top of our amazing NY experience!

We stayed in Janine's place in early Sept., for a week.  The apt. exceeded my expectations, and I would heartily give my highest recommendation.  Janine greeted us upon arrival, showed us pretty much everything we'd need to know about the apt, and then checked in twice via text during the week.  Location is quiet, safe, with amenities in the neighborhood.  An excellent little Italian place, Piccoli, is less than two blocks away.  \r\n\r\nThe apt. was spacious, very clean, and had a fine kitchen for cooking quick meals to save money; we used it mainly for breakfasts.  NYC was roasting hot our first two days there, and this is a third floor walk-up, so it was very hot, but the AC in the back bedroom made it bearable.  \r\n\r\nI almost hate to give such a good review, as I know I'll probably never find this space available when I want to visit NYC in the future, but I have to be truthful.

We always got the informations we need immediately, so don't bother to write her :). From JFK its about 55€ with an Uber right to the doors. There are lots of restaurants nearby Janines house. So there was no problem to have breakfast every day at another place.  Or dinner in the evening. It takes about 5-10 minutes to the metro station. From there maybe 10 minutes and you are in Manhattan. So no problems at all in terms of commuting. The apartment is as cozy and nice as it is described. There is everything you need for your stay. Even if you want to cook, it has a fully equipped kitchen. All in all I just can highly recommend Janines place for your NYC visit. Its close to Manhattan, but not in the middle of the rush.

We enjoyed our stay in Barcelona mainly because of how centrally-located the apartment was - close to the metro and main stations, as well as city staples like P de Gracia, Sagrada Familia, La Ramblas \u0026 Plaça Catalunya. The apartment itself had the basics. The enclosed patio overlooking the main street was a very nice addition and made our mornings entertaining as we people watched whilst sipping coffee. The hosts were easy to talk to as well, and check-in arrangements were a breeze.\n\nOne gripe I do have is that the wifi was really really slow (even with full signal strength!). We couldn't browse or book anything online, and even basic websites would take a while to load. Good thing there is an awesome cafe downstairs that offers a decent connection. I don't watch a lot of tv when I travel, but to those who do, it might be wise to ask the host how to operate the digital antenna or just bring your own media since there were no channels on tap (both English \u0026 Spanish).\n\nAside from these \"minor inconveniences\", I'd say I'd go back and stay here again.

The woodwork in the second floor apartment, which I believe we were told was refinished by Steef and his family, created a warm, cozy backdrop for our weekend in this peaceful neighborhood. The apartment had the intimacy of a bed and breakfast with a comfortable level of privacy. Steef and his wife made sure that we felt at home and made things very easy for us with prompt and clear communication. Among the establishments nearby that we enjoyed were Saraghina, which was suggested to us by our host and had food that certainly rivaled over-celebrated artisan pizzerias such as Roberta's in style, taste and atmosphere, and Georges-Andre Vintage Café, a homey spot on Halsey and Stuyvesant with donuts from Dough and excellent cappuccinos.

There's no kitchen to speak of, but a cabinet with a small fridge and a coffee maker had everything we needed for coffee and the Saraghina bakery nearby fed us in the morning. \r\n\r\nWould stay again!"},{"_id":"31420363","date":{"$date":"2015-05-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4365756","reviewer_id":"24547122","reviewer_name":"Diana","comments":"We hebben 5 nachten verbleven in dit charmante appartement in Brooklyn.

Het appartement is zeer ruim, schoon, een goed bed en fijn dat je een aparte woonkamer hebt waar je kunt vertoeven als je dat wilt. Mogelijkheid voor het zetten van koffie en thee en de aanwezigheid van servies, bestek en een koelkastje vonden wij heel erg praktisch en prettig.\nSteef, bedankt voor je goede zorgen, de fijne ontvangst en de tips!

I pop along to a local hipster coffee shop and met a full range of people, from urban types, to young professional family types, established members of the Jewish, LGBT, art and music communities to a host of friendly New Yorkers (check out Counter Culture Café for a real positive clash of heritage).\n\nThe apartment has a kitchenette arrangement; is just enough and very much like one would find in a city centre property in Paris, Bangkok, Tokyo or anywhere else in the world where a good cooked meal is so inexpensive to buy it really doesn’t make sense to cook.\n\nThis has been a real joy from start of the process and I’m looking forward to staying again on my next trip....\n\n10/10 for Steef’s hosting skills - big respect."},{"_id":"36201214","date":{"$date":"2015-06-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4365756","reviewer_id":"33884791","reviewer_name":"Michael","comments":"Ich habe 10 Tage in Steefs Apartment gewohnt und bin sehr zufrieden mit Unterkunft.

Also, Steef was a great host by being available when we first arrived to give us the keys and to recommend some great restaurants in the area (e.g., Peaches and L'Antogoniste). The neighborhood is very charming with all types of places to eat within walking distance and safe, but still easy to travel to other parts of Brooklyn by Uber or cab.

Steef is a great host - lots of advice for places eat and things to do and always available if we needed him.  The space itself is absolutely beautiful - roomy, clean and full of interesting decorative items.  The bed is super comfy and the bathroom was great (lovely shower!).  The location is awesome - 10 mins maximum walk to a few different subway stations and the choice of local or express trains to Manhattan.  The local area is eclectic and beautiful - a welcome respite after a busy day.  Plenty of bars/restaurants/wine shops and Delis everywhere.  Our favourite breakfast spot, Manny's, is a 10 min walk and they also have a great Wine shop with friendly staff.

Sheung Wan is next to Central, so incredibly convenient, but unlike Central, is nice and peaceful - no car horns honking, no party animals drinking till dawn, and best of all, no construction sounds.  Fantastic!  The flat is up 3 flights of stairs, so you need to be fit and not have a heavy bag - however the advantage is that you get lots of lovely light and sunshine thanks to the many large windows.  You get morning light and afternoon light due to the East/West orientation - so there are no humidity/damp issues unlike some other North-facing apartments in Hong Kong, nor is it too hot like some South-facing apartments in the summer.  The flat itself is spacious by Hong Kong standards, but 2 couples might find it small unless they were on very close terms, haha!  It was spotlessly clean, which was wonderful.  The air-conditioner seemed very new and efficient (quiet too) so also nice and clean (unusual in Hong Kong which is full of old and dirty air-conditioners).  I made a couple of suggestions to Minhee and since I definitely plan to come back, I am hopeful they will be adopted.  Minhee and her assistant were both very nice, and easy to contact.  She also let me check out a bit later (2pm) which I really appreciated.  I left a coffee plunger for future guests because I think most people like a good cup of coffee.  Maybe future guests can donate some other bits of kitchen stuff since all the basics are certainly there, but it is nice to have a few extras, particularly if there is more than one person staying.

There are plenty of little hipster coffeeshops, restaurants and shops around this area. Street art is all over too! \nThere are a couple of big supermarkets near as well as convenience stores open 24/7.\nThe apartment was equipped with the basics for barely 4 people.\n\nThe less Good:\nWe never met Minhee, the Airbnb profile's face. At the same day of check-in we were contacted by the assistant who left us the keys at given location eithout meetingnus face to face. Basically we didn't got to know who were hosting until Minhee's assistant appeared only because the bathrooms light broke on the first night. Promises were given to fix it, the assistant came to try change the bulbs but the lamp was really broken. Until we left we had no bathroom lights for the entire 8 nights nor further contact from Minhee or assistant.\nThe apartment is on the 3rd floor of a narrow building without elevator, so carrying luggage up narrow stairs wasquite a challenge.\nSome cutlery and plates were incomplete missing one from a set of supposed 4 each.\nWe found our rooms drawer cabinet coveredin dust, definately the apartment wasnt cleaned for some time.\n\nNobody cared for us even at check-out day. We had to take initiative to remind the delegared assistant that we were leaving.\n\nOverall good location but zero human interaction with host(s)."},{"_id":"49593803","date":{"$date":"2015-10-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4372254","reviewer_id":"8951243","reviewer_name":"Betty","comments":"Nous avons regretté de ne pas pas rencontrer Minhee."},{"_id":"50851646","date":{"$date":"2015-10-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4372254","reviewer_id":"3677154","reviewer_name":"Nico","comments":"All of our contact with through Divine, who was lovely and did her best to accommodate us.\nArrival was a bit of a drama, we were not sure when we would be getting there from Shenzhen so Divine left the keys for us to pick up when we did arrive (which was late).\nWhen we found the apartment and got in the internet/WiFi had run out of bandwidth, and our Chinese SIM cards would not work in HK. First thing the following morning Divine was at the door, of course we could not contact her to confirm that we did arrive, so she had come to replace the modem and we were then able to use Internet! Very thankful for that, although the HK tourist SIM that we bought later that day has 5gb data which was more than enough for our 4 night stay.\n\nThe apartment is convenient to all locations, though no surprise as HK has one of the best public transport systems.\nFor HK this apartment is very decent. Location, size, and amenities (perhaps not the cutlery or the bathroom light that needs mains-servicing) are well worth the price compared with other apartments. \nDefinitely do try some of the Chinese restaurants on the streets further down from the apartment. English may not be spoken, but most seem to have English translations on their menus - and the food is MUCH better (and cheaper) than some of the more popular restaurants that serve your basic \"sweet and sour\".."},{"_id":"51454330","date":{"$date":"2015-10-20T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4372254","reviewer_id":"36506303","reviewer_name":"Rainie","comments":"we love the house. thanks so much."},{"_id":"52094276","date":{"$date":"2015-10-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4372254","reviewer_id":"44395689","reviewer_name":"Sawittri","comments":"My experience here was nice. Minhee and divine (her assistance) was very helpful. She allowed me to check in early (11.30am) and late check out (16.00pm) which i really appreciated. \r\n\r\nThe location was great as many comments has mentioned. Very quiet neighborhood which i love. with a walkable distance to MTR Sheung Wan. \r\n\r\nWe are family of 4. there's 2 rooms with 1 double bed each. i give one to my parents. But since I don't share bed with my brother. So he have to sleep at the sofa. But that's ok. the sofa is big enough for him (he's 185cm high and it's a new one not the red one in the picture) \r\n\r\nI saw the comment below mentioned about the light bulb in the bathroom. It still has not been fixed yet. i tried to change the light bulb with another one in the house but it still doesn't work. May be it's about the fuse. Quite difficult to use the bathroom with the little light from the outside (have to open the door all the time when using the bathroom)\r\n\r\nBut the shower's water flow was nice. Strong and warm enough to relax your day.\r\n\r\n: For Thai People : This apartment is on the 4th floor! It's 3 in Hongkong and other European country. But in our country it's 4 (they count the ground floor as G and the 2nd floor as 1st) and it's quite an exercise to drag up you belonging up to the narrow stairs to the 4th floor T-T (no elevator)\r\n\r\nOver all it's a nice place to stay. I would definitely return if i'm coming with my friend next time. But for elderly i think it's a bit defficult for them to use the stairs. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"_id":"53044044","date":{"$date":"2015-11-04T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4372254","reviewer_id":"8849671","reviewer_name":"Claire","comments":"The apartment was really well located, not too far from transport links, lots of good bars and restaurants.

The bed was really comfortable, which was important as I am a light sleeper.\r\n\r\nThe only thing worth noting is that the bathroom light hadn't been fixed (as mentioned in a few previous comments) so using the toilet/shower at night meant leaving the door open to get the light from the kitchen, which is okay if you are travelling as a couple or family. I was travelling with a male friend, so it wasn't so comfortable. \r\n\r\nEmails and messages were replied to really quickly when we were there.

Excellent location to access and explore HK. Communication with Divine was very good. Great value for money considering the high cost of hotels in HK. I would stay there again. Only glitch was that we were a party of 3 men needing 3 beds. Listing advertises 2 rooms/3 bed/4 guests. We arrived and there was no bedding for the sofa the first night. While it was remedied the second night, I don't think we should have had to request linens for a 3rd bed given the listing description.

We arrived at 2am and were a bit unsure of the area but couldn't have chosen better. It has character and interesting little shops. There are also some great coffee shops and places to eat round the corner. There are quite a few hills and steps around which for us is fine and we enjoy walking around, someone less able might find it a struggle. The same with the apmnt being on the 3rd floor. We walked from there up the Peak which was a great walk but very hilly. Worth doing and good for the calves! All instructions provided were great. Access really easy especially with the code and key safe and, as we were off having different meetings, it meant we could both get back in at any time. The street is quiet but right off a key road and you're at the escalators and plenty of bars and restaurants in 10mins so it's a busy enough area and taxis are easy to find even at 5am when we left. I was with my boyfriend but as a woman I felt safe at all hours and on all streets and that applies throught HK in fact. I loved that we were in an old building rather than a new block. The flat itself is compact but fine for 2 of us. I think it would be a squeeze for more especially if you are in the flat a lot, but still doable - we were only there to sleep and refresh before heading back out again. Hot water is plentiful and the air con was great to have as it was hot and humid. We used the sitting room air con at night rather than the bedroom one as its quite loud and is covered by a blind. WiFi was great. We didn't use the kitchen for anything but it looked fine. Washing machine worked well and laundry products were provided. We asked whether there was an iron and ironing board and although there wasn't Minhee's assistant provided them the next morning which we were grateful for as we needed to have ironed shirts for meetings - thank you, Divine. We couldn't see a drying rack although there was something taped together down the side if the fridge which might have been one. That would have been helpful too. A few constructive comments - There was no hanging storage or drawers for clothing although 5 or 6 trouser hangers were provided so we just used the second bedroom to lay out all our clothes on the bed and hung hangers off the door handles. A very minor point with the sofa (but if you were inside using it a lot it would start to grate) is that the ends are just loose squares of foam standing free on the edge so..."},{"_id":"75028335","date":{"$date":"2016-05-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4372254","reviewer_id":"26013065","reviewer_name":"Candice","comments":"Minhee's apartment was great for our short stay in Hong Kong.

If you are traveling from the US or Australia and are used to space, this is a very distinct HK experience. If you are used to small spaces, you may be impressed with how Minhee used each corner, window, etc. this is definitely a designed ... Or \"hipster\" apartment. \n\nPracticality: Like much on HK, this apartment is on a hill and is a 4th floor walk-up. Ladies - don't bring too much and avoid the heels. Gents - the space is small so, if you are 5'10\" or above and not a skinny twig, you may want to rethink this apt. \n\nLocality: One way streets suck everywhere. Cabbies don't know the place. But Uber works in HK nicely so you'll be fine between walking, uber and the MTR. \n\nIn summary, yes - I'd stay there again.

The beds were comfortable and there were spare mattresses. The shower was surprisingly good! (I've lived in HK before and many bathroom/showers leave a lot to be desired). The bathroom is very tiny- as is usual in Hong Kong, so for a larger person it might be difficult to maneuver. It was totally fine for me and my family though! Be aware that it is a 3rd floor walk up,  not a hard walk but if you're not used to it, it might be hard.  Also note- the washing machine is not a washer- dryer. There are lines to hang your washing if you want, but we found a laundry just around the corner and they washed, dried and folded all our clothes- very cheap and they did it in one day! The wifi was great! Bring an ipad/laptop to watch if you need to unwind, there is no tv. The apartment was clean, tidy, well equipped and suited our needs perfectly. Minhee was very prompt with replies to enquiries and provided very clear and detailed information."},{"_id":"103046470","date":{"$date":"2016-09-20T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4372254","reviewer_id":"70335273","reviewer_name":"Joy","comments":"Minhee's place is cozy and clean.

It's very easy to find delicious traditional foods nearby and also you can enjoy soho lifestyle behind the uphill streets. Convenient to go to other places no matter by MTR or double decker bus!!\nBut there are something maybe you should be noticed before you would like to stay in Minhee's house such like the shower room was really tiny and hard to take a nice shower, there don't much places to hang clothes and also lack of hanger, if you would bring large luggages or even you would like to shopping in HK then you better be prepared to carry your luggages with all your strength to climb up to 4 floors without lift or elevator in this building!!\nMaybe the building was not very new so you could find mosquitoes easily get into the house!! Although there are 2 bedrooms but you just will have only one bedroom key to lock up one of them and there's no safety box in the house, so be sure to put your valuables in the bedroom which could be locked up and very important to be sure you bring the key with you all the time because if you lost the key or even you leave the key inside the bedroom but you locked up the door just like me, then you just prepare to pay lots of money to call locksmith to open the door!! Because the housekeeper did not have the second key to open the door!!\nIn short, it's not so satisfied in everything but you still could enjoy your holidays when you stay in Minhee 's guesthouse!!"},{"_id":"125815967","date":{"$date":"2017-01-07T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4372254","reviewer_id":"110229103","reviewer_name":"Yangbing","comments":"唐樓,冇電梯,不過好在係三樓,唔係好高｡其他都OK,有啲難尋｡好乾淨,廚房設備樣樣都有,好適合家庭出行或者接待來港親戚朋友｡"},{"_id":"127768684","date":{"$date":"2017-01-20T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4372254","reviewer_id":"69501314","reviewer_name":"Jackie","comments":"位置非常好,离地铁站很近,逛街泡吧很方便"},{"_id":"127915136","date":{"$date":"2017-01-21T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4372254","reviewer_id":"78205622","reviewer_name":"源都","comments":"The house is great.

The location is good--one can walk to the local Hawi town and it is under 30 minutes to outstanding beaches (Mauna Kea!) and even less time to pop in the water for a snorkel or look to Maui view for a sunset. Also Hawi is at around 500 feet elevation which makes for cooler evenings--less humidity--which is great for sleeping. The loft area bed is best for kids (one of our teens liked his 'man cave') but both of our tall teens would not have fit so well--there is a sofa bed in addition to the queen bed. All beds are in the same room as the loft/kitchen you see in the picture so no separate bedroom. Nice extras such as beach towels, chairs, umbrella and boogie board! Loved the fruit basket and blender! There is a fenced-in garden patio with table and chairs (but no view) and given it was rainy in the evening plus mosquitos we ended up never sitting outside. As a bonus for relaxed evenings with teenagers--wi-fi and several movies to choose from on netflix and a pizza place not too far away--in fact lots of local, casual, great food places--try Minnie's and CSC in the next town."},{"_id":"36518676","date":{"$date":"2015-06-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4379799","reviewer_id":"4515566","reviewer_name":"Sabrina","comments":"Jan and Jon's loft is not only beautifully done, it is absolutely immaculate!

Jan and Jon were wonderful hosts - they give you all the space and privacy you want/need, yet are always ready with really helpful information, guidance, tips, and where to find hidden gems for when you want to explore more of the area. I found them to be very friendly and personable, and they made me feel very welcomed and at home. The studio is directly behind Jan and Jon's house, but you really don't feel as if you're in someone else's space - it feels very private and you can come \u0026 go as you please.

Perfectly organized kitchen (wifey got kitchen envy), washer/dryer, dining area, comfortable bed, living space, patio. Our 10 year old didn't want to leave the loft :-)\r\n\r\nThe location is perfect. We took the stunning coastal route up from Pahoa and explored the many waterfalls en route. The icing on the cake was driving across the \"mountain road\" during sunset. Stunning ! We hiked to Polulu valley, explored Waipio on horseback and boogie boarded in Hapuna beach. All within a 30-40 minute drive from Hawi.\r\n\r\nJan and Jon are excellent hosts. Very warm and welcoming. Communication was perfect from the start. The place is really easy to find and Jan made us feel at home as soon as we arrived.

While it is just a single room plus a small bathroom, it is spacious and was just perfect for us. The \"upstairs\" bed is fun to sleep in. The loft is equipped with everything we needed - not only a fully-equipped kitchen, but also a washer and dryer. The location is very good to explore the little town of Hawi and the surrounding area. Don't miss the farmers' market if you stay here on a Saturday!\r\n\r\nJan and Jon are wonderful hosts. They gave a very accurate description of where to find their house (we found it at dark with no problems, even without GPS) and checked back on us to make sure everything was fine. They gave us directions to the farmers' market, to beaches and so on. And it was a pleasure talking with them - it was as if we had known them for a long time already.\r\n\r\nOverall, we definitely recommend this airbnb. If you prefer more than a single room, Jan and Jon own another house which is on the same lot...\r\n"},{"_id":"93408568","date":{"$date":"2016-08-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4379799","reviewer_id":"35093106","reviewer_name":"Bill","comments":"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Jan and Jon's loft and hope to visit there again.

Hawi is also greener, cooler (ocean breeze), and more secluded than the resort enclaves to the south, as well as a short drive from some of the island’s best beaches (20 minute drive to Hapuna). We also had a view of Maui!\nJan and Jon showed extraordinary hospitality, going the extra mile to make our stay so special. The loft house had everything that a hotel could offer, plus thoughtful touches like supplies for beach days (lounging chairs, umbrella, body boards, and a cooler). They also provided a pack ‘n play crib for our 18-month-old.

The place is like a mini apartment complete with a washer/dryer, shower and outdoor hot tub. No AC but the breeze and ceiling fans kept us cool during the day and night. The hot tub was warm and worked well. WiFi worked well and the TV had Netflix along with a few other app/channels. I recommend this place for couples traveling alone or for a family with small children. The loft bed overlooks the entire space so unless you don’t mind a lack of privacy I’d say this is good for 3-4 people. The couch was comfy but not long enough to sleep an adult. Loft bed wouldn’t be ideal for tall people either.\n\nThe location was in walking distance to the small town of Hawi where several shops and restaurants are located. The local food was excellent and the place was easy to find. About an hour north from the airport via a scenic drive during the day. \n\nAlthough we never met the hosts they were  quick to respond and supplied us with information we needed. There were plenty of clean towels, beach towels and beach chairs all available for our use. We had a designated parking spot and it was very quiet at night. We had ample\nprivacy and felt safe staying there. I would stay again and recommend this place.

We visited the Big Island for two weeks in August of 2018 on vacation. We stayed in 3 different Airbnbs while on vacation, this was our last location and we chose it for financial reasons (it was about $100 less than the other places we stayed). This location was our least favorite place due to the comfortability and the location (see list below). We wish we had stayed in this location for 3 days instead of 5. This space was very basic. Basic can be great at times and quite annoying at others. Thank you to the hosts for offering a safe place to stay. \n\nPros: \n-\u0009Safe\n-\u0009Bed is comfortable \n-\u0009Newer TV (it was nice to have the option to watch TV at night)\n-\u0009Basics included (4 plates, 4 bowls, 4 glasses; hotel soap/shampoo; paper towels; small amount of coffee) \n-\u0009Clean hot tub \n-\u0009Quiet \n-\u0009Parking space provided \n-\u0009Great vegetarian restaurant in town, great sushi too. \n\nCons:\n-\u0009Does not feel homey, feels more like a garage converted to a living space (we love Airbnbs that make us feel like we are staying at a friends house) \n-\u0009Tiny outside area with annoying gravel and motion detector light\n-\u0009Remote location, there are two or three restaurants in town that are great but this is a teeny tiny Hawaiian town be prepared. The volcano erupting also messed with our plans, we had stayed here because its closer to Hilo and that side of the island. Without that section to explore we ran out of things to do. This is not at all the hosts fault just something to consider in regards to your plans. \n-\u0009Teeny tiny kitchen, we used the table pictured as a bar in the picture as extra counter space and the owner wanted to charge us almost $90 to refinish it after our stay. We explained that we never placed anything greasy on it but probably set cold glass containers on it. How could that stain a table meant to be a bar?? They dropped that extra charge but it brought unneeded stress. We will definitely start taking pictures of all the Airbnbs we stay in now due to this experience.

She gave us some great recommendations of nearby hikes and beaches to explore.\r\n\r\nThe room was a good size and fairly clean.  Full disclosure, we did have an encounter with a gecko and one mosquito while in the room.  Malia's husband smokes outside the condo, but luckily on the opposite side from the bedroom so it was not an issue for us (no cigarette smell inside the bedroom at all).  She has two adorable small dogs but they do not have access to the unit.  I have bad dust mite and cat allergies and mild dog allergies but had no problem here.  \r\n\r\nThe heated pool was awesome - we had it completely to ourselves when we took a dip there.  Probably 50 yards from the unit.  Parking was easy for our rental car.

The room and surroundings are exactly as pictured, but what isn't mentioned is that their condo walls are covered by beautifully painted island art which were done by Malia over the years...really great!  We easily walked to all the resort amenities, enjoyed soaking up the sun at the resort's public beach, and watched surfers on the other side with the bigger waves.  My daughter and I were there over Mother's Day, and we were delighted to come back after the day's activities to 2 luscious, chocolate covered strawberries Malia shared with us, which were part of her Mother's Day gift!  Their condo is in a gated community which made us feel very secure.  Their backyard is the well-manicured golf course.  We were there to visit friends in Laie, just a 10-15 min. drive away, and at times when they couldn't drive us, we easily took the bus (the stop is just outside the condos' gated entry).

She is very knowledgeable about the area, things and activities to do around and in other parts of Oahu. On the day of our arrival, Malia and Bernie waited for us to arrive  to show us around even though they had a dinner to attend. The day I was leaving, Malia gave me a beautiful print of one of her water color paintings. Both Malia and Bernie were very helpful and available for questions or anything that you may need. I was there to attend a wedding at Turtle Bay and asked for an iron and board to iron my dress and they promptly provided both.  As noted by other vacationers, the room and the bathroom are in a private corner of the house and your privacy is well respected.

The room is cozy, very clean, and is located on the ground floor away from the living area, and near the front door for easy access. With this being said, be aware of two things. First, the AC unit is \"for emergency use only, please\" to keep costs and carbon footprints low. The October trade winds kept us cool, but the open windows needed for airflow left few sounds private. Second, they have a really sweet older dog. However, there is a doggy potty pad located right outside the bedroom door, which led to some surprises on our way in and out. Overall, we had a pleasant stay.

I wanted to get away from the hustle and bustle of town so at the last minute I looked into staying in North Shore. Many places had been booked as expected with 3 days notice, not to mention VERY expensive. I saw this place and immediately reserved. Within 30 minutes Malia accepted my request and sent me a welcome message. I didn't know what to expect as this was my 1st time using Airbnb. I took bus 55 from town and got dropped off right in front of the condos at Turtle Bay. Upon walking in the door I felt at home. I cant say enough good things and could go on for days so I will try to keep it brief:\r\n\r\nLocated in the resort area of Turtle Bay overlooking the golf course and only steps away from a heated pool, private beach, golf course, Turtle Bay resort, restaurants, tennis courts and bus stop.\r\n\r\nThe room and bathroom were clean, comfortable and well put together. King size bed (the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on), mini fridge with drinks, a basket of snacks, hangers in the closet, pamphlets on what to do, flat screen TV, 2 fans and an AC unit. With a window, sliding glass door and northern trade winds I never even turned on the AC. Both Malia and Bernie went out off their way to make sure I was comfortable. They were always available if I needed them, willing to chat if I wanted or not if I didn't. Bottom line if you want to stay in a comfortable place that feels like home away from home with kind and generous hosts for an affordable cost this is the place. I will absolutely be back next year and truly cannot thank them enough for making my trip a great one!

This is my first ever airbnb stay. I have booked it so long ago, as I drove to the Northshore, I did not remember everything about the place that I read when I booked it. I was amazed when I entered the neighborhood. I did not realize I was in the sought after Northshore right next to the Turtle Bay. The house looks like it is made for airbnb. The room is right next to the front door and the bathroom is right next it. Provides absolute privacy from the rest of the house. \r\nThe room looks exactly like the picture. Cozy, comfortable and you are surrounded by breathtaking paintings. Everything is neatly in order. Room has a key in case you are worried about security of your possessions. And yet I have never felt more secure in my own home or neighborhood like I did this week at Malia and Bernie's home.\r\nThere is a personal touch like the basket with healthy snacks, the mini refrigerator with the juices and all the lotions and shampoos you may want in the bathroom. I did not expect any of this at all when I was looking to spend 7 nights in someone's house for a bargain price. After having stayed in sterile impersonal hotels that provided no frills for the expense, this was a breath of fresh air.\r\nThe bathroom is like the room too. Clean, looks good as new bathtub, a cheerful shower curtain and the most eye pleasing paintings on the wall. \r\nThe access to kitchen and knowing there is a beach 5 minutes away from the house was a nice extra for me. \r\nBut the surprise of all are the hosts. Malia and Bernie made me feel at home, were generous and more than kind. Malia directed my attention to all the things only a local would know to do on the island and I was grateful for her planning most of my week and making the stay so enjoyable. When I did not get to see any surfers, on the last day of my stay she even went with me to show me the right beach to watch surfers. I would not have known to go there. \r\nEveryday there is a good morning and at the end of the day she was happy to listen to anything you want to tell her about the day. Again, not knowing anything about airbnb really, I did not expect this personal attention and help with my sightseeing adventures!\r\nThis is one week I will never forget. I was looking to stay somewhere less expensive and ended up feeling like I went to a favorite cousin's home and all the adventure was a bonus.

Like numerous others, this was the first time we have used airbnb and were not disappointed.  The room is EXACTLY as pictured, the bed is like a cloud to sleep in.  After a 9 hour flight and 1 1/2 drive from Honolulu, we wanted a nice quiet place to catch our breath and this was certainly it.  The room Malia \u0026 Bernie offer (along with bathroom for our own use just outside bedroom door)  is very clean, comfortable, safe and  importantly quiet.  Both Malia \u0026 Bernie are very considerate of their visitors and are quiet people themselves.  Malia having lived in Hawaii for many many years recommended  places to see, eat etc and we had numerous chats over the four nights we spent with them.  They both made us feel very welcome and as mentioned in other posts, Malia left snacks in our room and in the small fridge also in our room which we managed to enjoy over the days that we were there.  I would highly recommend this accommodation to any travelling couple, single person and also very safe for a single female travelling alone.  It's a great place to stay as a base if wanting to explore the North Shore and East Coast however you will need a car to get to the surf breaks such as Pipeline and Sunset.  The good thing is that nowhere is far on the Island so you can see a most of the coastline in a very short time.

A few things were a little bit of a surprise but all ended up good. We were very happy spending 6 nights in Malia's home. First I thought the room had an outside entrance from looking at the picture but found out it wasn't and we needed to enter the house. No problem. their door is always open and we came and went whenever we wanted. The second surprise was that our bathroom was not in our room but the door right next to us. Since we are the only guests sleeping there, and the hosts sleep upstairs, it was not a problem, though a little problem during the day when they are downstairs. They were very hospitable and knowledgeable so we enjoyed sharing their house. Parking very convenient. When we finished running around during the day it was great to be able to use the grounds of the Turtle Bay Resort. Special treat to be able to be at the pool bar and drink,eat,watch surfers and sunset at the same time.  Coffee made early and some packaged biscuits in our room. Almost forgot to mention there is a dog and cat.

Located in condos next to the Turtle Bay resort, we found the room to be super comfortable and convenient to everything. A short walk across the golf course brought us to the rocky beach where we saw a monk seal sunbathing! The drive to other north shore sites, and even to Honolulu was nice and easy (accept for traffic in Honolulu!). The bed was super comfortable, the host provided bath towels, beach towels, beach chairs, and bath robes for us! So nice! We used the pool just a few doors down - lovely. Malia made coffee every morning and we had some time to visit and get to know her and Bernie. It was like visiting family; we felt very much at home. Thank you Malia \u0026 Bernie!

I didn't get to meet Mary as she was away but her husband Bernie looked after us. He made us feel very welcome and told us to make ourselves feel at home which we did. He let us do our own thing and would usually be relaxing outside but was there to answer any questions we had. The room in itself is super nice and the bed soooo comfortable! All we needed. There was towels, loofers, toothbrushes, hair dryer etc. Every amenities you need. Bernie also told us we were free to use the coffee machine whenever we wanted and sit at the dinning table to eat. During the trip we also needed to do a load of wash and no laundromat around so Bernie let us use his washer/dryer for a very small fee but so convenient for us. We didn't use any of the facilities as we were sightseeing but there's a super quiet pool right there and the beach is literally just across the golf course. The Turtle bay resort is also around the corner and you can dine there or have a drink at the bar. It's about a 20 min drive to Haleiwa the main town but close to the Polynesian cultural center. But if you choose to stay there you don't really need to go anywhere else as everything is on hand :) Thanks Bernie \u0026 Mary.

We loved to leave the sliding door open all day and night to let the lovely breezes cool our room and to let in the natural sounds. We used the kitchen to make breakfast and lunches, which we took with us for day, and everything was very clean and well cared for. The bathroom is private, right outside the bedroom, and is also clean and well cared for. We enjoyed learning about the area from Malia and Berney and all of their restaurant suggestions were perfect (North Shore Shrimp Truck: garlic shrimp, North Shore taco truck: fish tacos (made with Ahi), and Kahuku Grill (best burgers!) We were at Malia's during the Pro Bowl, and the players and their families were staying at the Turtle Bay resort, so the resort was on \"lockdown\" so I cannot comment on the amenities available at the resort, but the beach there was great for snorkeling. I saw some of the biggest tropical fish I've ever seen. We didn't see turtles there, but saw them at nearby Kawela Bay (an easy walk from the resort).

Easy walking distance from Turtle Bay Resort and a short drive to tasty food trucks and fresh fruit stands.  We were able to buy a few groceries and use the toaster oven and microwave in the host's kitchen for breakfasts and the occasional lunch or dinner so we didn't have to eat out all the time.

We spent 2 weeks with Malia and Bernie. We had a very comfortable stay and felt welcome in every way. I'm a surfer and wanted to see the Pipeline Masters and we needed to be on the North Shore of Oahu and this is the place to be. I wouldn't recommend it to someone that wants to be in Honolulu or Waikiki on a regular basis. It's a good place to be if you want peace and quite, a golf course, and miles and miles of beaches of white sand, perfect green waves and of course warm sunny days.  You'll have a nice king bed, a private room on the main floor (no stairs), a small refrigerator in the closet, a flat screen TV, and plenty of space to put your belongings. Extra items that you bring, surfboards, golf clubs, or anything bulky will have to be kept in your car as they have no space for it. This is a very well kept residence and Malia was the perfect hostess and we felt very welcome in our coming and going. She knows all the places to eat and knows the island like the back of her hand.  We had the food trucks, Lei Lei's bar and grill (very upscale and within walking distance), and of course the Turtle Bay resort hotel very close by. I don't play golf but I hear the course is great and within walking distance. There is a surf break at the hotel and I was able to surf it a couple of times but the best places are Sunset Beach, Pipeline, among others within 5 or 10 minutes away.  There is a pool within walking distance that has a bbq and it is protected from the wind with a fence that goes all the way around.  An outside shower is there as well.  This is a gated community so you'll be pretty safe here.  You'll have a parking area just for you too!  A tennis court is there too, but who has time to play tennis when you have all of Hawaii to explore?  It was a relaxing vacation and many mahalo's to Malia!"},{"_id":"126537663","date":{"$date":"2017-01-12T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"438923","reviewer_id":"23251154","reviewer_name":"Amandine","comments":"Malia and her husband are a lovely couple who are always available to provide information or advice.

Their home, within walking distance to the Turtle Bay resort, is super cozy, the coffee is fresh and plentiful every morning, Malia's vibrant and spectacular paintings are on every wall, and their cats are soft and friendly. We loved the king-sized bed, our own private refrigerator that was stocked with cold tea drinks, and the nice basket of biscuits and granola bars. Their home is in such a dreamy part of Oahu-- so close some really magical places like Kawela Bay and the giant banyan tree in the forest nearby. We only rented a car for part of our trip, and the rest of the time we stayed close to the resort or took The Bus, which stops right out in front of Kuilima Estates. There are a few spots on the resort grounds where you can get food, though they're pricey. We most enjoyed getting poke and crab-stuffed salmon at the restaurant right on the golf course, Lei Lei's. The portions are generous there and the service is warm. Just know that if you don't rent a car you will need to allot more time to getting around outside of the Turtle Bay area. But we had fun bussing down to the food trucks across from Shark's Cove, where Malia's grandson has a place called The Spot. We had tasty breakfast tacos there one morning while we watched the January surf. We also took the bus to nearby Haleiwa and had a great time at Teddy's Burger and Tiki Bar for Happy Hour. Also, there is an Enterprise rental location right at the Turtle Bay Hotel so you could do like we did and easily get a car for when you want to venture out! We are so happy we stayed at Malia and Bernie's. What a paradise. They were always there to answer any questions we had or offer ideas for where we might visit, and yet they were so respectful of our privacy. When we were leaving, Malia gave us a gift of two cards with prints of her paintings, and one of them was of a rainbow over an Oahu valley. I had gone for a run a couple days before and I'd taken the trails to Kahuku point, the very tip of the top of the island. I hadn't brought my phone with me and when I was met with the most picturesque rainbow I was just kicking myself. Malia's card meant so much to me. What a lovely reminder of our time there.

I was traveling with my mom and we actually were a little nervous due to some problems with the first airbnb host. But we came to be relieved day by day thanks to their consideration, and genuine kindness. We enjoyed the breeze through the open door, the sound that leaves make and soft lighting lamp beside our bed. We went to the swimming pool a lot and could relax. Walking along the trail was a good start for a day. The two adorable cats are sociable enough to hang out with me for sone time. Watching sunset at resort pool was another gift. The best part of the stay was that I could purchase beautiful postcards drawn by Malia. I will never forget their warm-hearted smile with these cards. All in all, staying at Malia's home was like a compensation from God. I hope I could visit there again."},{"_id":"183273720","date":{"$date":"2017-08-16T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"438923","reviewer_id":"23210673","reviewer_name":"Sylvie","comments":"Salle de bain semi-privée.

While there was air conditioning provided, we did not need to use it as the evening breeze going into the room was cool and relaxing. And in the morning, the lovely sound of birds chirping welcomed us to the day ahead.\n\nThe beach at Turtle Bay, a couple of hiking trails, a good restaurant and a nice bar were within short walking distance of Malia's place.  Famous food trucks are a short drive away, and the Polynesian Cultural Center, North Shore beaches and other attractions are easy drives from her place.\n\nHad the chance to talk to Malia about her paintings (my wife and I loved them!) at the tail end of our stay and heard stories about her family and their 40 year life in Hawaii - I just wished we had more time to stay.  Malia's farewell present is immediately displayed in our apartment after arrival, a reminder of our stay in Malia and Bernie's place that made for a lovely vacation in Oahu."},{"_id":"205037955","date":{"$date":"2017-10-20T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"438923","reviewer_id":"70814379","reviewer_name":"Joselyn","comments":"Malia and Bernie were great hosts!

After checking kamaaina rates the price was still over $300 a night so we looked at Airbnb for something on the North Shore. We found this lovely room for under $100 a night and it was literally on the Turtle Bay golf course. We didn't need anything major just a place to shower and sleep.  However, the room was spacious,  internet/cable were available and we had a fridge.  The bathroom was immaculate and right next to the room.  Malia and her husband took the time to great us and ensured we were acquainted with the area.  We spent the days on the beach and eating in some great Restaurants in Haliewa.

And I did raise this issue with the host’s husband on the 3rd day, he admitted that his wife might have used it when we were not there.\n\nAlthough the kitchen rule stated that guests can cook their own meals; however, the living area of the host is very closed to the kitchen and the eating area (right next to each other), you can feel very uncomfortable because the host can make you feel that her personal space is being invaded by you (that was what happened on our 4th day morning that the female host made few abrupt remarks when we were using her kitchen to make toast and having coffee as our breakfast). We didn’t want to be an intruder so since then we did try our best to avoid using the kitchen while the female host is there.\nMay be the host should include a more detailed kitchen rules so the guests can make an informed decision before making booking in her house.\n\nIf you don’t like the cats to be in your  bathroom or your bedroom or on your bed (one of the two cats  jumped on our bed) you need to keep your doors closed. \n\nThis house is right next to the golf course, we were woke up shortly after 5am every couple days by the loud motor of the mobile crane (which is parked not far from the house)  that they used for pruning trees and park nearby. So you might like to use your earplugs, which we didn’t bring with us."},{"_id":"345322922","date":{"$date":"2018-11-04T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"438923","reviewer_id":"42079486","reviewer_name":"TJ (Titus)","comments":"Thank you so much!

Besides the two Marriotts and the Disney Auilana resort, there are a half dozen mixed use developments on the back side of the beautiful golf course.  Most are mixed, detached single family, townhouse/duplex style condos and everything in between.  This property sits behind the Golf Course Clubhouse.   Because it is a master planned area, the architectural style is gorgeous, what Seaside is to old Gulf Coast Florida, Ko Olina's architecture is designed to evoke an island cottage style.  While the West side of Oahu is much more of a \"desert\" climate compared to the very wet East side of the island, the entire resort is beautifully landscaped, huge variety of beautiful tropical plants and palms that complement the prevailing architecture.  Everything is lush and green, with beautiful lighting.  This section of single family homes is one of two immediately inland from the Marriott/Disney waterfront properties.  The two subdivisions are tied together with a network of private walkways that readily connect you to the main attractions of Ko Olina.  From Michael's property its a ten minute walk to the high end Roy's restaurant located in the Golf Course Clubhouse.   There is a shuttle that stops in front of Roys every 20 minutes that takes you to all three resorts plus the next adjacent retail area.   We preferred to walk, which is very lovely in the cool morning hours and at dusk.  From Roys its another ten minutes walk to the first of the three protected swimming lagoons, and to the most scenic restaurant on the West side, Longboards, outdoor dining right on the first lagoon looking across at the setting sun through a screen of tall palms (gorgeous).   More often we walked about 20 minutes to the complex of Restaurants and shops that is across from the huge Disney resort (Aulana).  Monkey pods is one of the best restaurants in Oahu, there is also a Sushi bar, an Asian fusion restaurant, a 'sort of' Mexican restaurant, Ice cream shop, Coffee shop, and a half dozen upscale retail shops and galleries (and equally important an ABC corner store, picture a 7-11 with fresh fruit, local treats, beach stuff, and liquor).     So in other words, we found the location great.   More important, the subdivision is quiet, sedate, gated, a double handful of residents.  Did I mention quiet?  Our downstairs neighbor was home about 4 days of our 10 day stay, but we never heard anything.  This is a huge difference from Marriott/Disney which are literal madhouses of people coming and going.  Disney is the greatest family resort I've ever seen, but literally a thousand children running wild may wear on most people.  We loved to walk to Disney's lagoon at dusk, wander back through the gorgeous lobby and shops, listen to the live music, then walk home to peace and quiet.  The house was well equipped, nicely decorated and altogether suitable.  Point of reference we are 65."},{"_id":"39632742","date":{"$date":"2015-07-25T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4404740","reviewer_id":"34875348","reviewer_name":"Reeves","comments":"Our family of 5 spent a month in Michael's unit at Ko Olina.

It was great to be able to cook in the full kitchen and have dinners on the lanai. The gas grills at the pool were an added bonus.  The kids make great use of the pool while the adults had some relax time.  Being within walking distance to the lagoons was fabulous - no packing kids in the car and waiting for parking spots. We spent many days at the lagoons, watching the sea life - monk seals, turtles, and even found an octopus.  It was great to be able to walk or ride a bike to the ABC store for a forgotten item, or for Shave Ice \u0026 Ice Cream.  There were plenty of beach towels and the beds were all comfortable. It was so much nicer to have a safe place for the kids to roam around the neighborhood, looking for lizards and geckos than being confined to a hotel room.\r\n\r\nMichael was a great host, and went WAY above and beyond on a couple of occasions.

Plasseringen var flott men det er litt lite som skjer på kveldstid. Det er lukkede arrangementer på hotellene i nærheten men der får du ikke tilgang. \r\nLeiligheten var slik som beskrevet og holdt ok standard. Det var endel mangler ved rengjøringen så vi måtte begynne å vaske med en gang vi kom men verten kompenserte oss noe for dette.  \r\nOmrådet har fantastisk strand og vi likte oss svært godt der, det er stille og rolig med lite bølger men fint for snorkling og bading. Basseng området brukte vi lite da våre barn er glade i å hoppe, løpe og stupe og det var ikke tillat i bassenget. \r\n"},{"_id":"105340758","date":{"$date":"2016-10-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4404740","reviewer_id":"72883892","reviewer_name":"Rebecca","comments":"I traveled to O'ahu with a group of friends and family for a girls trip.  Michael's place was just as described and a beautiful place to stay.  It was very safe and the neighbors were friendly. I loved the ample room for everyone and the balcony too. The pool was a  wonderful place to gather and cool off. The pool area has a place to sign up to use a covered BBQ area for your group if you want. We didn't use it, but it was nice to know it was there. The Lagoons at Ko'olina were AMAZING!! We went to several of them during our stay and again after we moved to the North Shore. Waters were calm and sandy beaches we great, but there was grass that you could lounge on instead if you didn't want to get all full of sand. Lots of beach chairs, towels and toys available as well as a garage if you need one. There were no bugs inside the residence at all, which is very important to me when traveling to Hawaii. This place was very clean. Communication was great with Michael and he always got back to me with any questions I had very quickly.  I would definitely stay here again.

We were within a 10-15 minute walk from the lagoon and Mike even provided us with some snorkeling gear, boogey boards, chairs, etc. to take with us to the beach.  The location was super convenient for the first half of our trip since we spent most of our time at Aulani, but towards the end, we did a lot of driving to Waikiki and the North Shore (we played it by ear most of the time, so our itinerary was pretty open).  The beds were comfortable, the AC was nice and cool, and the neighborhood was peaceful. I didnt hear any noises whatsoever from people downstairs/next door.  Mike was also very responsive to all my questions and answered them quickly.  \n\nA few things to note:  \n1) You do have to wash the sheets and clean before check out, but if you don't mind then it's not too much of a big deal.  \n2) You have 2 parking spots (garage and driveway). There were 8 of us and we had 3 cars (some people arrived/left later than the rest). There is no street parking. There are several Guest parking spots between the villas, but you need to get a special permit from the front office.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this place for families who are interested in staying close to Aulani. \n\nMahalo to Mike for sharing his home with us.

We went with a 2 1/2  year old and we were in walking distance to many beaches with low-tide to no-tide which made for perfect day trips to the beach. We were able to swim with sea turtles and see a seal taking a nap (Paradise Cove Beach - short walk from the condo). Also, the Disney resort is across the street which is fun for kids to go see.\n\nThe location was very convenient, you could walk to the grocery store, many restaurants and shops, a luau spot, golf and many beaches. We also walked to the car rental to pick our car up. (Hidden by Airbnb) maps makes the walk places seem far more difficult than it actually is - it gave us 30 minute walk times around weird routes and when we finally figured out the right way the walk was (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) minutes at most. \n\nWe rented a car to drive to the more touristy spots (Hanauma Bay, Pearl Harbor, North Shore, etc.) However, we found the best beaches and atmosphere in Ko'Olina. It wasn't crowded (besides the Disney resort) and was very relaxing. \n\nOverall, a great trip and a great place to stay!

The area that it is in is also beautiful and peaceful.   The pool at the place is great ... as is the hot tub.  We also used the barbecue grill and cabana next to the pool to cook dinner one night, which was fantastic.   The Lagoons are nice and much less crowded than Waikiki beach!  The beach is farther away than I had anticipated.   I thought we could walk there.   But with three little kids and all we had to take with us ... driving was the only way for us to get to the beach.  I think to walk to it would have been over a mile. \n\nI rated our stay good ... and not excellent ... for two very important reasons.  \n (1) It took us hours and hours to clean, change and wash the linen, and wash, dry, and put away all the towels, wash cloths, and anything else we used.   Michael offers a great deal on his place, but because of that great price, you do your own cleaning.   I feel like we wasted most of a day cleaning ... I think I would have rather paid a bit higher price to have the cleaning included. ... at least the linen and towels. \n\n(2) There are neighbors living below Michael's place, and they are very unforgiving with sound.   We came with three little kids and if they even walked fast from one room to another, the people below us got mad and banged on their ceiling.  It was constant.   The kids tried ... and we tried to remind them ... but it's hard for three little ones to remember to tiptoe at all times.  If they got the last bit excited, the neighbors below would get mad.  If they bounced a little soft ball, we got in trouble. If just my husband and I were coming, I think it would be fine ... but I Would NEVER stay again with little kids.   It was way to hard  ... it felt like we were yelling at them to be quiet the whole time ... and we weren't really in the condo all that much ... but when we were ... we absolutely couldn't be quiet enough for the downstairs neighbors.  It was tough ... and will definately be a black eye on our vacation. \n\nBut Michael was great, his condo was beautiful, and the area is gorgeous.  Michael also does a great job of providing anything you may need to make your stay enjoyable.

No false expectations. \n\nThis is a perfect 'starter pack' for anyone who is a bit weary of the island life and might need a bit more of a cosmopolitan cushion to welcome them to paradise. In my case, it was the perfect place to show my family (the bulk of which are senior citizens that have various mobility needs) the beauty of Hawaii without worrying about them getting swept away by the crashing waves of a full blown beach.\n\nThe house did have a flight of stairs that my elderly auntie was able to go up and down (only when we were coming and going from the house) very easily with no complaints.\n\nThere is a cafe and lots of great restaurants that my family commondeared and visited daily. \n\nThe 20+ speed bumps to the villa were a bit obnoxious at first but one night, my boyfriend and I decided to go for for a stroll to see if there was a quicker way to get to the main strip where the hotels and the lagoons were so we gps-ed walking directions to Aulani and we were there in 12 min. It was a snap!\n\nMy family LOVED the lagoons. I had an aunt who didn't even bring a swimsuit to Hawaii but ended up buying one because of how gentle the waves were at the lagoons. It was their favorite place in all of the island (next to the Costco and Target there were just an exit away). \n\nThe pool in the community is a short little walk and is absolutely beautiful. There are 3-4 covered shelters where you and the family can pull up and grill some steaks. It was a great way to take advantage of the beautiful weather the last couple days when half of us wanted to chill and half of us wanted our time in the water.\n\nI've been to Oahu several times already, myself, so for someone like me and the the more adventurous and mobile people in my family, the mermaid caves are less than 7 min away, a drive to Waimanalo or Honolulu was about 30-45 min, but for the most part, it's not a bad drive. \n\nCleaning was an easy thing to accommodate with some diligent planning. \n\nOverall a great stay and a great deal granted all the amenities at your fingertips."},{"_id":"230930591","date":{"$date":"2018-01-29T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4404740","reviewer_id":"160096602","reviewer_name":"Britany","comments":"The host canceled this reservation 13 days before arrival.

There were chairs, water toys and a cooler for the beach - which is a short walk away.  We were 3 adults and 2 kids and there was plenty of space for us, for when we wanted to hang out together and when we needed a little quiet time.  The location is lovely.

My husband, baby and I were travelling with our in-laws and our brother-in-law and his girlfriend, and the unit was plenty spacious for all of us. The kitchen was beautiful and has every appliance you could need. There was no air-conditioning, but with the windows open we got a nice breeze that kept things comfortable. The location was fantastic, with less than a 10-minute walk to a very family-friendly beach and playground and the site had three different pools, plenty of green space and lots of gas BBQs to use. Pam was great, quick to respond to any questions and provided a list of activities and restaurants to try in the area. She also had lots of beach gear (towels, boogie boards, snorkel gear, etc) which was great to have access to. Only downfall was the unexpected notification that the building across from us was having their roof done while we were there, which resulted in one of the pools (the one right outside our unit) being closed and some construction noise, which was hard to avoid because of having to keep the windows open for air flow. \r\nLots of parking, quick drive to some local shops, plazas and hotels for a nice meal or drink.

Location is off main road so there's traffic noise at night/ morning.  Though the bathroom and kitchen are remodeled the rest of the apartment is really dated and shabby.

There were 3 middle aged couples in our group; a bedroom for each couple. There was plenty of room for us. The apartment is almost elegant. It was clean and well furnished and very comfortable. It is conveniently located in an upper class neighborhood of hotels and condos; surrounded by many other units all with pools and hot tubs. It is within walking distance to a beach backed by a 4 star hotel. You can walk to eating and a small shopping plaza. There is a major plaza with restaurants and tourist shops within a mile. Nothing other than Bubba Burger is cheap in the neighborhood. You can drive to Kooloa town for a super market used by locals and a middle class tourist area about 3 miles up 520 from the apartment.\r\n\r\nOnly negative is that parking is at a premium. Many permanent residents have reserved spaces and they park in other spaces leaving transients to fight for the few remaining spaces. If you go out for the evening and get back late, you might have to park in an adjacent area because there are no spaces available in your parking area."},{"_id":"62963270","date":{"$date":"2016-02-19T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"440924","reviewer_id":"41051858","reviewer_name":"Mae","comments":"Place is just a 10 minute walk to Poipu beach.

I would rate this condo 4.7 out of 5 (5 being absolutely perfect). Pamela's condo in Poipu is in a fantastic location, is beautifully furnished/stocked and reasonably priced. And dealing with Pamela is an absolute delight. Our party of 6 thoroughly enjoyed our 10-day stay. 5+ stars for the following: Location. Centrally located. Getting anywhere on the island is a breeze. You are just 20 min drive from the Airport, Costco, and major shopping. This means getting groceries for the week can be done in one run and save you lots of $$$. You can make a day trip of exploring the island to the north and west, and another to Waimea. Also, Poipu Beach Park, a family friendly beach is a 10-minute walk through breathtakingly beautiful grounds, or if you have small children it is an easy drive. The waves of Kauai are treacherous. Locals warned us several times of the dangers when visiting other beaches. Snorkeling and surfing lessons are an added 5 minutes away. We went to a Luau at a fancy hotel down the street. You CANNOT BEAT this location. It is awesome. The layout: Comfortable condo. Spacious and the pictures posted don’t fully capture the beauty of the space. Beautiful artwork and very clean. I love that there were two single beds in the loft as my preteen boy and teen girl each had their own bed!!! Lots of places will say sleeps 6 but only give you 3 beds… here we had 4… perfect for us! Extras: Beach towels. Snorkeling stuff. Boogie boards. Beach Chairs. Soap. Cooking staples. Not having to pack or buy these things - 5+ stars. Realistically this saved us money since we didn’t check our luggage, so it was nice to pack minimally. Pools: There are three!!! Which is fabulous. Some dummy brought glass into the pool closest to the condo and forced a shut down, but we still had access to the other two and the grill (locked inside the pool area). This bears mentioning because if you plan on cooking – grill outside to keep the heat in the house to a minimum. Laundry facilities. Save money. Don’t bring excess stuff and wash \u0026 reuse. The less than perfect rating comes from: The dryer - 3 stars. The vent to the outside needs to be cleaned to get the dryer working more efficiently. This particularly threw off my last day of vacation where I hoped to lounge at the pool and pack up clean clothes. I paid an extra day because our flight left at 10 pm. Had I known what I knew about the dryer, I wouldn’t have spent the extra night. The wifi. My children do schooling online and my brother needed wifi for work purposes. Unfortunately neither was able to use it at a reasonable time. Wifi is basic and shared with the community. The more people access it, the slower it goes...."},{"_id":"158640878","date":{"$date":"2017-06-07T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"440924","reviewer_id":"88160780","reviewer_name":"Gerald","comments":"Great place for a family vacation.

Condo is located a 5 minute walk from a great public access beach to the west and a 5 minute walk to the east is a very nice Hyatt resort.  Both beaches are great places to spend a day snorkling, surfing or sunbathing.  The beach to the west is a great place to catch beautiful sunsets and the beach to the west provides access to a great stretch of the Heritage Trail that provides  great ocean and landscape views.  It also leads to the Makauwahi Cave reserve, which was an interesting visit.  Plenty of restaurant choices, a grocery store and shopping also within walking distance.  We used a rental car for access to the north side of the island but with the beach and hiking during the day and condo pools at night, we could have just relaxed in the condo area the entire trip.  Pamela provides a lot of nice little extras that make it easy to enjoy all the area has to offer.  Her communication is timely and access excellent.  Highly recommend."},{"_id":"325822385","date":{"$date":"2018-09-20T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"440924","reviewer_id":"83636653","reviewer_name":"Barbara Barbosa","comments":"We loved Pamela's house, and we felt at home.

We really appreciated that they provided initial supplies of shampoo, conditioner, paper towels and soap. Also, the location couldn't be better. Poipu by itself is great, with a nearby shopping center, restaurants and grocery stores. Also, the place is strategic because you are close to west shore and east/north shore.

It's common to expect certain things, but typically the units have this but not much more. This rental is different, you can tell it's not just a rental but the owners really care about their place. We really felt at home here, at one point we bought some local steamed pork buns. We figured we would have to create a make shift steamer basket. But it turns out the rental had one. I know you might be thinking, who rents a place for a steamer basket. Your right no one does, but it does show you that this condo has just about anything you might need. It has all the big expected items, but then it has so much more. Pamela is super responsive, she even allowed us to ship a few items ahead of time to the rental.\n\nThe location is great, it is off a kind of busy road. We found that the unit was angled in a way that we never heard the traffic, but we also had a great breeze the whole time that mostly we just heard palm trees blowing in the wind. It was super comfortable there, the breeze blew through the whole house, it was quite amazing actually. Honest highlight to our trip. I can see that if the trade winds died down and it was a hot day, having no AC or breeze could make the unit uncomfortable. Based on what I know of Hawaii that is an exception not what is normal.\n\nWalk to the beach, the walk to the beach is 10-15 minutes. The walk to the beach though is stunning and enjoyable on it's own. It was easy and safe to get to.\n\nSide note we stayed here with our 16 month old son. The condo was very kid friendly, better than most Airbnb's we have stayed at. The beach that was within walking distance was kid friendly also, there was also a playground at that beach.\n\nPamela truly deserves more than 5 stars for her place."},{"_id":"366564398","date":{"$date":"2019-01-02T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"440924","reviewer_id":"174851414","reviewer_name":"Jeff","comments":"Imagine if your favorite aunt had a great condo in Kauai and when she heard you wanted to go, offered to let you use it.  That's the experience we had with Pam.  She's not our aunt but she made us feel at home.\n\nPam's directions made the unit easy to find and the address is also easy to find using (Hidden by Airbnb) maps.  It was easy to get in to the condo when we arrived.  The code for the programmed deadbolt worked and it was easy to use to get into the condo and secure it when we left.  Upon entering the condo, we found a huge plate of homemade cookies waiting for us along with other great Hawaiian snacks.  The condo was clean and nice.  Not so nice that you were afraid to touch anything but tasteful and comfortable.\n\nThe beds were all comfortable with nice linens and an assortment of pillows.  The kitchen was fully stocked with a wide variety of spices, cooking oils, vinegars, pots, pans, utensils, and knives.  Again, it felt like we were staying in someone's home, rather than in a dedicated vacation rental.\n\nThe unit is perfectly situated with easy walking access to Poipu Beach, Brennecke's Beach and Shipwreck Beach.  We enjoyed the easy walk on an almost daily basis and often visited all three of the beaches in a day without much effort.  It's also an easy walk to the Grand Hyatt which is a great location to get a coffee and enjoy the sunrise.  There are a number of pools and hot tubs on the condo grounds so if you find one to be overly crowded, it's easy to find one that is less crowded.  Same for gas grills for barbecuing.  There is also a nice tennis facility on the grounds that we enjoyed using during our stay.\n\nThe Poipu Beach location is also an easy drive to all the other areas on the island.  The longest time we spent in a car was when we returned from Hanalei and reached the north edge of the Wailua area a little after 5:00 PM and encountered commuter traffic.  The total return trip was about 2 hours with heavy traffic congestion.  We made the drive up in about an hour.\n\nPam has also stocked the unit with an assortment of beach gear.  There were boogie boards, beach chairs, snorkel equipment, tennis rackets and a nice sized cooler.  Pam's suggestions for activities, restaurants, etc. were great.  Pam's place easily accommodated our family which included 3 adults and 3 children. \n\nWe had a great time and loved our stay in Pam's condo.  We explored all over the island and this unit would be our first choice if we return to Kauai with the full family again.  \n\nThanks, Pam, for your part in making our time in Kauai so special!"},{"_id":"402847029","date":{"$date":"2019-01-19T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"440924","reviewer_id":"189347978","reviewer_name":"Danilo","comments":"Tutto perfetto, communicazione ottima, posizione ottima, camere spaziose e pulite, accessori ed oggetti da mare a disposizione senza preavviso.\nConsigliatissimo\nideale per 6 persone"},{"_id":"412530264","date":{"$date":"2019-02-15T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"440924","reviewer_id":"74468","reviewer_name":"Kristen","comments":"Pam's place is wonderful.

She showed us multiple rooms and gave us freedom to choose.\r\n\r\nShe was always available via text/call, otherwise not seen or heard - so it felt like we had this piece of paradise to ourselves.\r\n\r\nThe room was perfectly accommodating and the off-grid elements were charming without compromising convenience/comfort. Sunrises are spectacular, evenings are quiet with a mild and relaxing chorus of animal life.\r\n\r\nWe loved our mornings on the hammock, followed by yoga in her open air yoga structure, and quick trips to Uncle Robert's for acai bowls and smoothies and walks to the ocean on the cooled lava coast.\r\n\r\nAsk about the local black sand beach, and make sure to drive South on 130 onto the cooled lava and go as far as your comfort will allow and drive North into Pahoa (and pick up a hitchhiker) to explore the town.

The connection to Manhattan is good; the bus runs every few minutes and takes you to the express subway lines. Moreover, the studio is beautifully furnished and decorated.

Everything was clean and they left coffee, cereals and milk for breakfast, which I found very sweet. The area is totally safe, and it's very easy and fast to get to Manhattan. Everything you might need is in the area, which makes everything easier for people who don't have a car. During my stay I had no problem. The only little flaw that I can find is that some days it got pretty hot, but this is New York summer weather. I read the old reviews, and I have to say that I found the mattress really comfortable.

Also plenty of washing up liquid, kitchen paper towel, washing  liquid, toilet paper. The made one feels at home straight  away.\r\nA big plus pf tis property, is peace and safety of the location.

It's definitely more of your quiet, residential neighborhood, very appropriate for families since I was traveling with my toddler in tow. Stores and fast food restaurants are within half a mile walking distance. Not far at all. I rented a car so this location was great because there was plenty of parking! It was also the midpoint of JFK Airport and Woodside Queens where I drove to most of the time. If you're looking for a place closer to the city with easy access to subway stations then this property will not serve you well. You'll need to take a bus to subway station. \n\nApartment has its own entrance through the back which is great! On a nice day you can have a picnic outside on the yard or just relax to reset your mind from all the NYC craziness. :-) The property does offer a cozy and warmth feeling. It is also not cluttered with any of the owner's belongings like some Airbnb properties are (Airbnb advises hosts to stow away belongings for safety reasons). The apartment is equipped with a full size bed I believe if I'm not mistaken, free wifi and cable tv. Apartment does not have a full kitchen BUT it does have a full size refrigerator and microwave....AND a washer/dryer! Loved it and used it. We went home with clean clothes and no laundry to wash! \n\nI had a late check in and Sol was very accommodating with this. She even assisted me with my luggage and tried to console my crying 3 year old boy to make him feel more comfortable. Any questions I had, Sol was quick to respond back. She was easy to get a hold of and a pleasure to speak with all the time! She is a great host and will go the extra mile to make your stay as comfy and safe as possible.

This was our first air b\u0026b experience and we were hoping very much that it would be as the reviews and the photos.\n\nPros:  Location close to our activities (Website hidden by Airbnb) Street parking was fairly easy to find (Website hidden by Airbnb) Neighborhood quiet (Website hidden by Airbnb) Washer \u0026 Drye (Website hidden by Airbnb) Sol was kind enough to accommodate us with an early check-in.\n\nCons: Unfortunately we were unable to rest after a long overnight flight because of all the noise from upstairs.   All the walking back and forth felt like someone was trampling on our heads.  During our five day stay we did not rest properly at all because of the noise from lengthy phone conversations and general activities upstairs.  \n\nThe bed was uncomfortable.  Every time one of us moved it squeaked very loudly.  There were no nightstands.  I slept on the right side and there was no place to put a bottle of water or a box of tissues.  I kept hitting my elbow on the shelving unit at the side of the bed.  The layout of the apartment was not very convenient.  We were unable to watch TV because of the location of the TV.  The two lawn type chairs in front of the TV were difficult to sit down on and get out of.  The only mirror for getting dressed was in front of the bed.  The only table to layout make-up etc was away from the mirror.  We had to keep walking back and forth to get dressed.\n\nHousekeeping notes:  It was a basement apt.  Although it was listed as having air-conditioning, there was NO air-conditioning.  There was a fan that was adequate but had to be kept on constantly.  Bathroom was miniscule.  The seal at the bottom of the shower was discolored.  The vent in the ceiling of the bathroom was full of dust.  The mirror in the bedroom needed repair.  The molding at the bottom right of the mirror was broken.  The ironing board cover needs replacing.  There was a huge burnt hole on the cover.  I had to get a t-shirt to cover the hole so that I could iron our clothes.\n\nPersonal Preferences:  I would have liked a bin to put our recyclables.  I would have also liked a box of tissues to be available.\n\nAir B\u0026B says to remember this is a person’s home not a hotel.  While I realize that it is a person’s home, that person, the Air B\u0026B host is utilizing their home as a business, by charging a premium for guests to use their home in lieu of a hotel room.  In lieu of paying a premium, the guest should expect to receive certain basic expectations , like an adequate layout, a nightstand, a clean vent in the bathroom, bathroom sealant that is not discolored a comfortable chair to sit on, and a comfortable bed.  To be honest I felt rather let down by all the reviews.  \n"},{"_id":"163138626","date":{"$date":"2017-06-23T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4430808","reviewer_id":"6145447","reviewer_name":"Melissa","comments":"Sol and Izak were the perfect hosts.

Die Lage ist gut und ruhig. Das Haus ist ein wenig hellhörig aber nicht störend.

They always checked on us to see if we were okay. They were quick to respond whenever we had questions, and made sure our stay was enjoyable. A few things to note when booking is that Sol \u0026 Izak live upstairs so you occasionally hear them walking around and talking, there are only 2 tiny windows so it does get stuffy and hot (especially on hotter days), and the bathroom is on the smaller side so it is a little cramped when you're in there. These things didn't bother us much, but if it will bother you, don't book your stay here. Other than that, it was a pleasure to stay at Sol \u0026 Izak's place."},{"_id":"263655652","date":{"$date":"2018-05-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"4430808","reviewer_id":"154868084","reviewer_name":"Isaac","comments":"Much more than we expected, so amazing and close to public transit it made our visit that more wondrous.

The space is very private in a quiet and safe community, and there are fast food restaurants, convenience stores, drug stores, and gas stations within walking distance. We would recommend this place to anyone who wishes to have a homier place than a hotel to stay at. There's also a private garden area outside the unit you are welcome to use.\n\nSol \u0026 Izak provide you with some breakfast items; you have the use of a hot plate, microwave, refrigerator, TV, wi-fi, small but full bathroom with shower, sink, medicine cabinet, and toilet, there's a washer and dryer in the unit for your use also.
