This place seemed to be recently refurbished and looked great however there were a lot of scuff marks on the white walls which again isn’t a huge deal for me, it’s just something they should fix. In general the whole place was great except for two things. The couch in the living room of my room had a lot of stains on it and I am not a fan of that. The other thing is with the hot tube. The host told me the hot tube guy comes 4 times a week, but there was no evidence that he showed up during our stay. The chlorine float had nothing in it and the hot tube didn’t smell good the whole time we were there.

He did give us suggestions of places to visit during our stay, which was great. We didn't receive breakfast at all though, which is why we chose that house to begin with. It should be advertised as self service and self catering. It is more of a hostel than a guest house. There was no toilet paper for the duration of our stay and guests need to clean up after themselves and provide whatever they would need for themselves. When Miguel finishes the decorations and final touches of the house, it should be very beautiful and exciting.

Chris and Maya were wonderful hosts/landlords very respectful of your privacy yet very helpful. They even shared their eggs, milk, coffee, etc. with me and very thoughtful. The back yard is an absolute gem!! and should not be missed - spend some time there, if you can - esp. in the mornings; it's like this oasis (Website hidden by Airbnb) The neighborhood is OK - Pele St. is on a hill on the slopes of Punchbowl, I believe, but the street is VERY steep.  The parking in their driveway is a bit tricky so initially you may need help - I did but it was fine after the first try.  The steps leading to the house (it's downstairs) could be challenging for some since it's also rather steep and at night, a bit difficult.  The motion detector lights did not work.  I suggested a guard rail to assist you down the steps so maybe that'll help some.  Also there are children upstairs, so if the patter of little feet/footsteps bother you, you may want to look elsewhere but it didn't bother me.    I'm sure it's much better in the winter or spring time since the Punchbowl area can be very hot/muggy on Kona-wind days.  But it's very pleasant in the early mornings and late afternoons and there are two ceiling fans.  The bed was very comfortable and there's also a large monitor for viewing Netflix streaming.  The view out the front door/windows isn't much but if you're \r\nplanning to just do shopping (like me and out most of the day) and not there for the view, it's fine.\r\n\r\nOverall, I thought it was a very positive, good experience and place."},{"_id":"15740817","date":{"$date":"2014-07-14T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2530337","reviewer_id":"2986298","reviewer_name":"Keith","comments":"Probably the nicest and most helpful hosts I have ever stayed with.

Maya gave us tea and grapefruit juice and offered a ride to shopping mall but we slept through for several hours. The next morning my wife became more sick so she rested at home. Maya was extremely kind as she let us check out late and lend us the necessity we needed. We went to a clinic and stayed home until 5pm and left for a flight at 640pm. Maya's place was really close to hospital and many restaurants and we were able to commute to airport within 12mins.

What a treat, there were already a couple of beers in the fridge  - but we had brought a bottle of wine so we left those for the next guest.  Maya was very gracious, offered any help we needed lol including a ride from dinner back to the house to be provided by her husband.  LOL I'm not sure Chris was in on the offer!!  But we were tired and snacks and wine were just right as we relaxed watching a Net Flixs movie.  Maya also provided yogurt, coffee, tea, bread and butter for toast, oat meal and best of all fresh Mangos from their tree in the back yard!!!  The guest room was clean, and comfortable, a bit sparse but perfect for what we needed.

What a sweet little oasis in the middle of the city! Maya and her great kids made our stay so memorable - not to mention the fresh-picked mangos that we ate greedily. First wonderful surprise was that they saved us a parking spot inside the fence, I had been worried about parking on their street, but they took good care of us. Maya gave me a nice tour of the house (there's laundry!), which involved several steep stairs (not a problem for us, but worth noting for others), and into the apartment. I was shocked from the second she opened the door - it was SO much nicer than I was expecting! Just beautiful! And the kitchen was filled with so many treats and cooking supplies that I felt like we were really staying in a friend's home. There is no AC, but the fan in the bedroom was more than adequate, and we were there during the hottest summer on recent record, so anyone staying in the future will be fine, I promise. It was a bit noisy at night (not from the hosts, from street and neighbors) but wasnt too bad considering the busy location in the city.\r\nAlso, we were flying standby and were not sure if we could fly home on schedule or not. Maya was SO accommodating to hold the room an extra night for us, and was great with keeping in contact with us the whole time. The apartment was wonderful, but what really made this stay shine was Maya and her family.

First, Maya responded right away to my reservation and we ended up e-mailing back and forth quite a bit. She's extremely responsive and friendly. Unfortunately she wasn't in town during my stay in Honolulu so her husband, Chris, let me in. Very nice guy - he even offered to give me a ride to my hotel in Waikiki (which I had booked only because the apartment was booked for the fourth night of my trip).\r\n\r\nThe space is very comfortable for one person and certainly adequate for two. In addition to the bedroom, there's another room resembling a large walk-in closet where you can store your luggage so that it's not next to the bed. The bathroom is quite spacious as well. \r\n\r\nThis is a perfect place if you want/need to be close to downtown and/or away from the tourist madness of Waikiki. You get a better sense of the \"real\" Honolulu and are much closer to Iolani Palace, the Bishop Museum, and Pearl Harbor than if you stay in Waikiki. I walked to downtown in 15 minutes and also discovered a bus line with a stop only two blocks away from the house. \r\n\r\nThe wi-fi signal is strong if that's something you need to have. Note that there is no air conditioning, though.

Located a comfortable walk from the very centre of Honolulu CBD, staying with Chris with Maya was like staying in your friend's spare room. \r\n\r\nWhile we did not meet our hosts during our stay, everything was ready for us and their communication and directions to the flat were exemplary. Clean, cool, secure and comfortable and had everything we needed.\r\n\r\nWe walked everywhere from here and felt safe at all times. We walked into Chinatown and as far as the Bishop Museum and back from here with ease. When we had to catch a taxi home it cost roughly $12 from the Ala Moana Centre so a cheap trip. Bathroom and all facilities were clean and well maintained. Not fancy, but I suspect fancy people don't use airbnb and actually stay in hotels at Waikiki and pay four times as much as this and have no interest in seeing how real Hawaiians live! We loved staying here. Would suit fit and independent travellers with a sense of adventure wanting to make their trip up as they go along, and see urban sights of Hawaii outside the Waikiki tourist strip. A chance to see contemporary Hawaiian culture in the sights and happenings in the streets around you.\r\n\r\nA couple of points to note: if you find the gate latch difficult to open lift the gate up. Bed squeaks a little ;). Stairs to the flat are steep so take care. If you are taking a airport transfer or taxi tell them it is the TOP side of the street above the freeway and give them the crossroad as the street continues both sides of the freeway.\r\n\r\nThings NOT to miss in Honolulu all within good walking distance of here: Zippy's Restaurant, Bishop Museum, Chinatown especially the restaurant called The Pig and The Lady, Honolulu Museum of Arts in South Beritania St (sp?). If you are looking for cheap clothes stop at a Ross store, one right in the city centre.\r\n\r\nAll in all we would definitely stay here again."},{"_id":"62962878","date":{"$date":"2016-02-19T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2530337","reviewer_id":"36340102","reviewer_name":"Carol","comments":"If you want close to Honolulu your within 15 of city centre.

It's a 12 minute walk and I found out that walking is faster than driving during rush hour, and who can't use a walk?\r\n\r\nTheir place is clean, updated, private, and equipped with everything I needed.  Air conditioner in the bedroom, ceiling fans, apple TV, full kitchen with all of the pots, pans, bowls, cups, etc I needed, and they stocked the place with a fresh loaf of bread, eggs, yogurt, bottled water, and juice that I was welcomed to dig into.  Why anyone would go farther for a hotel, I can't imagine.\r\n\r\nI was at the last minute trying to secure a place for my work stuff and Maya and Chris were immediate with their communication by text.

Because of our schedules, I never actually got to meet either Maya or Chris, or even speak with them on the phone, but through our text communication and their responsiveness, I felt like a was staying at a friend's place.  \r\n\r\nI'll definitely book here when I'm next time and look forward to finally meeting my new friends in person!\r\n\r\n5 stars fer sher!\r\n"},{"_id":"85130792","date":{"$date":"2016-07-10T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2530337","reviewer_id":"57696347","reviewer_name":"Miguel","comments":"Very nice place in an ideal location.

This family absolutely embodied the Aloha Spirit in each of our interactions; they continually went above and beyond to make me feel welcome and comfortable, supplying extra items I requested, sharing their delicious homemade food with me (mango jam, smoothies), providing information about the city - they were just spectacular! Plus, it is a ten minute lovely walk to the hospital. Thank you for a wonderful experience! I hope to return some day soon!

They were responsive and hospitable. They had the Keurig set with a timer so the water was ready to in the morning and a box of K-cup coffee ready for use. Mornings looking out the kitchen window into their beautiful backyard were worth waking up for.\r\n\r\n The place was very clean and was stocked with dishes, pots and pans.  The full sized refrigerator made it easy to stock up on groceries-- Foodland and Safeway within a few miles.  They also shared their washer and dryer which I made good use of before packing up. \r\n\r\nTheir location is perfect as you have easy access to two highways and you're a few minutes to downtown, but just out of it enough that you can manuever around traffic. *Warning: (Hidden by Airbnb) Maps has it mostly right, but hasn't mastered yet which lanes to be in for all freeway/highway changes and some of the loopy-windy roads.*\r\n\r\nSince rain is fickle, the steps leading down to the apartment can be a little slick.  They also are a little steep.  Having said that, I think it's fine, but maybe not with young children you have to carry.  I made plenty of trips up and down during my 10 days with grocery bags, luggage and all and didn't have a problem, but I was also traveling solo. \r\n\r\nIf you're in town for business or pleasure, you really can't beat this location!

The host's wife was waiting for us outside she was not the original person we were told we would meet nor was she the host. We were showed the apartment. She tried to answer our questions though she did not speak english. She was kind but in a hurry to leave. There was only half a roll of toilet paper for the two bathrooms in the apartment. We were staying for a total of 2 nights. We were unable to get toilet paper at the supermarket as it was closed. We then contacted a different lady (The actual contact person provided to us by the host.) who we were instructed to get in touch with by the host as he was out of town. She told us she was having dinner and to just go out and buy some toilet paper, which we had tried to do with no success.  When we told her the nearest market was closed she told us to find another and she would come the following day with more toilet paper. By the next morning she had still not come and so we tried to get in contact with her again. The host finally got in touch with us. He was extremely rude and abrasive. Telling my husband that we were disrespectful to his wife and to the other contact person. I then spoke to Francisco myself and he proceeded to accuse my husband once again of being disrespectful as he figured my husband had asked too many questions about the property. When I told the host about the toilet paper and the overall cleanliness of the unit, he told me that we could leave if we were not happy. He told my husband that it was not his problem as the host if we could not find a supermarket that was open the night before. Francisco proceeded to say that he would have \"Taken care of my husband\" had he been there himself. I felt threatened and afraid to deal with Francisco at that point. I would not recommend staying at this property or any other that Francisco may host.

Generally, the apartment was clean, convenient, and the neighborhood pleasant. The only downside was that the air conditioning unit did not function effectively. It did not blow cool air and when turned down on the remote, it still felt like hot air. The unit had 2 small fans that we used at nights and these were effective.

Mar was great about communicating in the months and days prior to our arrival.  We never met her as she had a guy called pablo meet us when we arrived.  He was very nice but I'm not really sure who he was.\r\n\r\nThe location of the apt is fantastic, 30 seconds to sagrada and metro.  We toured everywhere in this beautiful city and loved it all!\r\n\r\nInside the apt it was clean but small.  I think the photos made it look bigger than it was.  We used one pull out sofa and the bed and they were pretty comfy.  Towels were fresh and clean.  Mar had also provided soap, toilet paper, washing up liquid and a sponge which was Great.\r\n\r\nBathroom could use some updates as the shower head was not working very well.  The street is so quiet but inside the apt you can hear the neighbors upstairs walking around and next door we could hear every word of the conversation.  \r\n\r\nThe main issue we had was a lack of windows and natural light.  There is one small window in bedroom, one coloured window in Living area, and one in bathroom.  They all open out to alley ways and provide no views of the city or much fresh air.  \r\n\r\nWe loved Barcelona and will be back again someday!!!"},{"_id":"110950789","date":{"$date":"2016-10-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2536984","reviewer_id":"61753230","reviewer_name":"Анастасия","comments":"This flat looks exactly like its photo, I can't say, that it is spacious, but for four of us there was enough space.

She was a great host who responded almost instantly whenever I had questions prior to our trip. Mr. Roger met us at the apartment and he was so nice and accommodating and answered all of our questions patiently.\n\nThe pictures do make it seem a little bigger than it actually is, but not a big deal - The space still fits 4 comfortably. As well, the water pressure and temperature in the shower did mess up whenever someone used the kitchen sink, so just be mindful of that! Also, you can clearly hear the next-door neighbour when you’re in the bedroom, so bring a pair of headphones if you have a hard time falling asleep through noise like me.\n\nIn terms of location, the fact that this apartment is right next to the Sagrada Familia is a huge part of its charm—  you could hear the bells from the living room and it was magical! However, I did find it to be a little inconvenient when wanting to go to the city centre (La Rambla and Placa De Catalunya) because it is at least a 40-minute walk away. However, the metro system in Barcelona is very straightforward to use and there are many bus and subway routes near Mar’s apartment because the Sagrada is such a huge tourist attraction! \n\nThanks for a wonderful stay, Mar.

Le stanze sono dei piccoli appartamenti con cucina a vista: la soluzione ideale per chi viaggia in famiglia e sceglie di pernottare per più giorni. L'accoglienza è stata ottima e tutto il personale è sempre stato disponibile e gentili. La zona può intimidire al primo colpo ma invece facendo un giro si scopre un quartiere bellissimo, fatto di tanti piccoli bar e caffè. Inoltre l'albergo è a davvero 3 fermate da Times Square, basta attraversare il ponte (e godere della vista). Consigliatissimo, ci tornerò prima o poi.

Although Terry's place is a bit of a way from the city center, everything was so easily accessible buy bus or train which has pickup points very close to their home. Considering this was Hong Kong, their home is spacious, and the room was bigger than something you would find in the inner city.

Thinking this was a great deal and not TOO far from the green line via bus, my husband and I booked the bedroom with ensuite bath. The interaction with the host was awkward from the start. My husband and I both heaved our luggage onto the tiny porch while looking for the key in the mailbox. I couldn't see that Julia was inside washing dishes with only the screen door opened. My husband went inside to get the layout while I guarded the luggage. No help from her at all or introduction. Later when we went to the back deck to eat, she repeated 3 times make sure to close the screen door...and seemed befuddled that we would chose to eat al fresco instead of in the stifling living room. The next morning we awoke to banging, drilling, and lots of other noises. Apparently Julia had hired a handyman to do some construction in the house but didn't bother to tell us. Thanks! He was pleasant; just doing his job. We called Julia to see how long he would be there- no response. We opened our windows and the ones in the living room because it was sooooo hot in there and we closed them before we left. The next day we did the same but left them opened because the other tenant was enjoying the air as well. The next morning, Julia removed the cranks so the windows could not be opened. Shortly after that we cancelled the rest of our reservation, but not only because of that issue. She was not accommodating AT ALL!!! It was a chore to ask her for toilet paper, especially after she had a door erected between the kitchen and where she stayed. Also she was dressed inappropriately most of the time in a shorter nightgown ( often with no bra) in front of my husband. She even came into the kitchen wearing just a bathrobe when my husband was cooking, reached across him to turn the vent of the stove on instead of going around. I don't know how she got her rating or her supposed hospitality, but she must have left it in Vancouver!!!!"},{"_id":"292236676","date":{"$date":"2018-07-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"25479588","reviewer_id":"28505501","reviewer_name":"Nagyeong","comments":"Julia was a great host.

My brother and his girlfriend arrived first, Elvira allowed them to leave their bags early and provided some port wine and snacks. They said she was very nice, although I never met her. We arrived late as our flight was delayed and we had been traveling for over 24 hours. We were very tired and had a bit of a hard time finding the place as our cab dropped us off on the wrong side, the neighbors were very friendly and helped us find it. The apartment was very cute and clean, perfect for 4 people. It definitely gave you the feeling of living in Porto, with the streets decorated for an upcoming festival and lots of potted plants and local children and pets enjoying the nice weather outdoors. The location was perfect, easy to walk to the river, as well as the town center. My only complaint would be that it was so hot, but they were getting air conditioning installed the day we left! I would definitely recommend this apartment! Great location and value for the price."},{"_id":"280973573","date":{"$date":"2018-06-24T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"25485516","reviewer_id":"71238853","reviewer_name":"Benjamin","comments":"Had a fantastic experience staying in Porto.

The location is quite convenient;  it takes 10-15 min. To walk to the main hot spots in Porto (Ribeira river front, D Luis Bridge, Cathedral, S Bento Station, S Catarina Street, etc.).  The neighbourhood is safe and quiet at night and there are grocery stores nearby.  \nElvira is an amazing host - very nice, friendly and kind.  She greeted us and made us feel welcomed from the first moment. The pastries, port wine and souvenirs were a very nice touch.  During our stay Elvira was very helpful  with prompt communication. \nWe had an amazing vacation in Porto and Casa da Ponte had a big contribution.

The old school gate lift was an interesting experience that we don’t get anymore in Singapore.\n\nWalls are rather thin so you will hear noises of people moving around outside but it wasn’t really an issue for me.\n\nAll in all, a great stay in HK!"},{"_id":"366612778","date":{"$date":"2019-01-03T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"25501014","reviewer_id":"199793694","reviewer_name":"Emily","comments":"交通便利,房东贴心,楼下饭店很多好吃的很多,房间装饰很有特点｡"},{"_id":"368502300","date":{"$date":"2019-01-07T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"25501014","reviewer_id":"231011429","reviewer_name":"睿华","comments":"这个价格在香港租到这样的房间已经算不错了~"},{"_id":"368762907","date":{"$date":"2019-01-08T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"25501014","reviewer_id":"35831000","reviewer_name":"Trista","comments":"the room was small (expected, and very common in hong kong) but clean. excellent location, mtr and airport bus are within 3 minutes’ walk.\ni saw a review where a guest complained about the lift, i didn’t see any problem - hey it takes you from here to there, what’s the big deal of having to open the gate yourself? just a friendly reminder - open the gate as soon as it reaches your floor, or it may leave if other people pressed the button on other floors.\nonly one minor problem - the room is right next to the lift, if someone lets go of the lift door you can hear a loud “bang” when it shuts. again - not that big a deal for me.\noverall we are satisfied and will consider coming back."},{"_id":"400703055","date":{"$date":"2019-01-13T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"25501014","reviewer_id":"117225094","reviewer_name":"Caetano","comments":"A very well located place to stay."},{"_id":"401236578","date":{"$date":"2019-01-14T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"25501014","reviewer_id":"217957818","reviewer_name":"慧晓","comments":"房子整潔,地理位置便利,雖然房子小,但使用設施都很好很方便,就是抽風機聲音有點大｡"},{"_id":"403479898","date":{"$date":"2019-01-21T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"25501014","reviewer_id":"6006972","reviewer_name":"Michele","comments":"Good apartment for a short stay.

Just as the hosts describe, the apartment can at most accommodate two willing to share a double bed with additional 'one and a half' bedding in a separate room.\r\n\r\nThe area is abundant in many non-chain restaurants and bars for travellers that do not want to venture too far from their accommodation in the evenings; Katz's Deli is definitely one to add to the list!\r\n\r\nAs other reviewers have pointed out, the area can be a bit noisy especially on the weekend evenings, but if you were hoping for a quiet and relaxed vacation, why choose beautifully manic NYC at all?\r\n\r\nMelanie was not around but kept in touch by email/airbnb and assisted as best she could at all times, leaving the numbers of her housekeepers who greeted us when we arrived and who we could contact should we have needed anything which we didn't."},{"_id":"71625231","date":{"$date":"2016-04-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2563967","reviewer_id":"727128","reviewer_name":"Philippe","comments":"The host canceled this reservation 7 days before arrival.

Zushi on Victoria Street is great Japanese for either lunch or dinner. Casoni is located in Taylor Square and just a short stroll away for Italian. Bills is just down the road on Liverpool Street and is a local institution for both coffee and breakfast/lunch.

There are fans in every room to keep cool and plenty of island breezes.  This is a great condo and we highly recommend it.  The swimmable beach is approximately 5 minutes walk down the street. In front of the condo there were lots of turtles and a tiny inlet sand area where you can sit to watch them and look at the ocean view.  It's very peaceful and relaxing.

We had time for only  a short stay (three nights) on this, our first trip to Maui, so we were looking for an oceanfront place in a central location,  with great views from lanai/balcony.   We didn’t  want to stay in an expensive resort since we intended to spend our days sightseeing around the island, not hanging out on the property. \n\nThis place fit the bill perfectly.   It’s a\n1br/1ba unit perfect for a couple, possibly with a youngster on the couch.  Spotlessly clean, not new but recently refurbished.  Right on the water with a good size lanai for dining/morning coffee.  Great view. Two AC units although we didn’t need to use them.  Excellent host provided all the info needed plus sightseeing tips. Check-in couldn’t have been easier.  The complex is equally well kept and managed.  Very quiet. No complaints at all.   \n\nWalk just a few blocks to the harbor for whale watching and tour cruises. Walk a few blocks in the other direction to reach Sugar Beach \nBonus—-the property’s own small “pocket” beach had anywhere from 4 to 12 sea turtles  hanging around within 10 yds of shore every time we looked."},{"_id":"351421489","date":{"$date":"2018-11-22T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"25688687","reviewer_id":"32980002","reviewer_name":"Ana","comments":"Love the place, the location and the host!

Solveig was a charming and organized host who embodies the island's aloha spirit. I felt like a welcomed guest in her home. Her place is located just a short walk from a Kalapaki Bay, a great beach for swimming, sunning, surfing and Paddleboarding (rent a board or book and adventures with Kauai Beach Boys (Website hidden by Airbnb) I did their Wet Rappelling on a 60ft waterfall, Awesome!) and several good restaurants (Love the simple Ahi wrap at Duke's barefoot bar).  Solveig's home is located in the center of the action and I was worried the evening noise of the the nearby bars/restaurants might be a bother, but for me it wasn't an issue. Solveig thoughtfully offers earplugs in the room, and it might have been fine without, but I went ahead popped those in and turned on the white noise of the air con and it was no problem. My days were very active so I pretty much passed out each night! ; ) My room was small and simple, perfect for one, with a dresser and hanging room for clothes. The bed and comforter were nice and comfortable and I appreciated that she provided an extra blanket. I always bring my electronics so wifi was a plus! Solveig provides fridge and cupboard space in the kitchen, so if you're the type that looks to cook or just want to have some basics on hand, make a stop at Costco first and you'll be set for the week! I arrived when Solveig was out, but she provided great detailed info before my arrival and all worked out smoothly. I had a rental car and had no issue finding parking nearby, and as a single female, I felt comfortable walking around the neighborhood(normal caution of course), even on busy bar nights.

The noise was not a problem for me and I go to bed early. Ear plugs and white noise were fine. The location is really fun. Technically you could stay here with no rental car and have access to beach and restaurants....but you will want a car for at least some of your days to tour around. Burgers at the beach hut a stone's throw away are delish.\r\n"},{"_id":"30053378","date":{"$date":"2015-04-16T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2576604","reviewer_id":"30120527","reviewer_name":"Kimball","comments":"I had a wonderful time staying at Solveig's place.

Accurate description regarding the karoake (had me laughing though) but I could see some people having trouble sleeping if they are light sleepers. \r\n\r\nThe place is neat, bed was clean (no sign of bed bugs or critters), room was clean, and bathroom stayed clean with a full house. However, the last part is going to be more guest dependent. Solveig offers one set of towels for your stay but you have access to the washer and dryer downstairs and she offers soap. A nice touch for my 9 day stay in Hawaii. \r\n\r\nThere is plenty of room to eat if you decide to bring carry out back to the place and she opened up her kitchen (I used the fridge) if you decide to get some light groceries. The fridge is segmented by room so I wouldn't buy too much stuff unless it was OK with other roomates.\r\n\r\nMy room had a desk which was very useful for my video capture/editing needs. I even had a aerial craft and found it to be enough room with a laptop and a few small cameras. Anybody who is traveling with gear might find that very useful to know.\r\n\r\nParking was very easy in the lot next to the apartment. \r\n\r\nOne thing to note is the front door lock -- it took awhile to make sure it was locked properly so I would make sure to check this when entering/exiting the place. Same goes for the laundry room. \r\n\r\nAir conditioning is very cold in my room but keep in mind, island electricity is so expensive that it's best to run it when you are there. My room also had a fan. \r\n\r\nThis room is great for a solo traveler who is looking to explore the island most days and crash at nights. It's also in a good location for walking to get food. The bed is a twin bed so for you very tall people (I'm 5'8) it may be worth considering what room may be more comfortable for you."},{"_id":"48113813","date":{"$date":"2015-09-23T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2576604","reviewer_id":"43233499","reviewer_name":"Shaun","comments":"I traveled to Kauai on business and in order to avoid the ridiculous hotel prices I decided to try Solveig's accommodations. I will say that this place was perfect and everything I needed. It is in a very central location, close to food, entertainment and the beach, which is challenging to find on Kauai without a large expense attached to it. The room and house in general was very clean and organized. I have absolutely no complaints, however I do have a couple of suggestions: \r\n\r\nYou will most likely not meet Solveig, which was a bit weird for me to go into someones house without actually meeting the host. With that being said, you MUST read her extensive instructions so you are clear on how this situation works. I would also suggest getting there during the day because it can leave you a bit confused if you arrive at night, especially if you have a car. \r\n\r\nIf you have a vehicle, which I highly recommend then remember not to park in front of the house. If you are standing on the road looking at the house, the big lot across the little bridge to the right is not only public parking, but you can leave your car there over night without being towed. This was quite a source of confusion for me because I was very concerned about parking in an area where I would be towed. I didn't feel like it was completely conveyed where it would be safe to park over night without the risk of being towed so I hope this helps a few people. \r\n\r\nAnother piece of information you need to know is that although Solveig leaves her local number to text her on or call, she does not respond to it at all and seems to only communicate via the messaging system provided by Airbnb, you also need to know this in case you have questions. \r\n\r\nYou may also have a very pleasant and friendly lady approach you and follow you into the house at some point. She knows who you are, but of course you have no idea who she is. Most likely this is Debra who takes care of the cleaning at the house. She is a very nice lady so don't be alarmed. \r\n\r\nLastly, especially if you are staying in room #2, I highly suggest having the air conditioner on fan mode all night to drown out the noise coming from the bar next door. With the fan on, you barely hear anything at all, which makes it possible to sleep. \r\n\r\nOnce again, these last pieces of information are NOT complaints. I was very happy with my stay and it was perfect for what I needed. I will definitely stay there again on my next business trip. I hope this information helps you in enjoy your stay.

Its perfectly central to the north and west part of the island. If you don't mind wearing ear plugs (they provide good ones) this place is great. I had no problems getting a very restful nights sleep even with all the night life!"},{"_id":"74672260","date":{"$date":"2016-05-16T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2576604","reviewer_id":"4640039","reviewer_name":"Eljon","comments":"The room and home were as described everything was clean and ready for your stay.

Public parking very near the apartment . I didn't have really any interactions with my host, but she was a text away from any questions or concerns. \nThe only confusion I had was when I first arrived , I had a slight hard time figuring out what door to enter in, but again, solveig was there to walk me thru it step by step. \nMy bedroom had a lock with a key you took with you so you had your mind at ease the your belongings where safe. \nI highly recommend staying here and also I highly recommend renting a car so you can see the true beauty of Kauai. \nMahalo and hope to be back in the future.

Very vlose to the beach (a 2 minute walk), a few bars, restaurants, and plenty of shops. Very family friendly. I came for my 21st birthday and i loved the location. I get to relax, shop, and drink whenever i want. I felt very safe here. She is very detailed about rules and information. Follow her instructions and you wont have a single problem. Everything is clearly labeled for convenience. I had no trouble (and little interaction) with others in the house. The pace is slow in this area, very relaxed which was perfect for me. However, if you're looking for a big city feel this is not the island for you. I had no issue with the noise.\n\nThe home is very clean. I ran into a couple bugs and quite a few lizards on the property. It was expected, it is a tropical island after all lol. Theres a few stray cats that hang around the shop next to the house \u0026 plenty of chickens."},{"_id":"184022802","date":{"$date":"2017-08-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2576604","reviewer_id":"19951905","reviewer_name":"Sudhir","comments":"Everything is thought out in the house, location can be thought of as mid way to Napali, Kalalau, poipu, and airport, unless you want the Hanalei Bay experiences itself."},{"_id":"187300091","date":{"$date":"2017-08-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2576604","reviewer_id":"677111","reviewer_name":"Doris","comments":"Solveig’s place is literally just a couple minutes walk to the beach. It's not the bluest beach but it's local, tamed, and more/less a quieter stretch of sand good for paddle-boarding and easy swimming. Sunrise is amazing if you can wake up for it. I think many of the people from the neighboring chain hotel do that. \n\nThe room itself is good for someone who is going to be in-and-out. As in the description, if you are looking for a peaceful night's sleep...this isn't for you. Earplugs are supplied because of the tavern next door (you will hear the cars, and yes, you will hear all the songs to sing along to). With that said, sunrise made up for all of that. \n\nCheck in and check out is a breeze. I left my things in the laundry room easily while waiting for a flight later in the day. I walked around the beach if you don't have a car (the limited number of shops and cafes around aren't too special)."},{"_id":"188565693","date":{"$date":"2017-08-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2576604","reviewer_id":"1336215","reviewer_name":"Tamara","comments":"Nice place for easy access to a quiet beach near the Marriot and several casual or fancier restaurants near by...   There were beach towels and even extras such as snorkeling and body board although the waves at the bay where the place is located were not strong enough to make use of it and the bays water is a bit murky but if you had a car it would be great!\nThe room is small and simple but comfortable and gets very warm in the afternoon and one of the nights I stayed the air did not seem to work right, but otherwise it was very organized and clean.  The karaoke did not seem noisy at all with the fan on:). \nThere are 3 rooms that are rented out separately and all felt safe and comfortable.  \nDebra, the lady who helps manage affairs at the place, was AMAZING!  She went out of her way to be kind and help me settle in- she offered and went to the store for me for groceries and helped me even after I left.  Debra was the greatest gift of my stay in Hawaii, can't say enough how much her kindness touched me:)\nAlso there was a small gift of a Souvenir from Hawaii  which was a very seeet and thoughtful touch.\nWould stay again and for the price being so near the beach was great:)"},{"_id":"189457106","date":{"$date":"2017-09-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2576604","reviewer_id":"64817517","reviewer_name":"Brian","comments":"Everything was as described.

Didn’t get the chance to meet Solveig, but everything was well explained beforehand. \n\nAs she states in the description, the place can get a bit noisy due to a couple of pubs and bars in the immediate proximity.

The small rooms have great fans and a small but modern air condition unit for comfortable night time sleeping. I didn’t find it noisy as described but lucked out and my stay was Sunday through Wednesday evening. The cruise ship docks on Thursdays causing the night life noise increase on Thursday nights.

Everything was clean and there was cozy common space should you choose to use it.

Pros: Location close to a beautiful beach and several good places to eat (loved the beach hut across the way). Room and bathroom were decently clean if a bit dated/cluttered. Cons: Host was very slow to respond. Common areas were cluttered and fridge was a bit smelly. Felt a bit colder (mood/mahalo-wise) compared to most Airbnbs in the way there were so many house rules and the tone in which they were written was sometimes condescending. Loud roosters but earplugs provided.

Solveig thought of everything to make a guest’s stay comfortable and convenient. Host was very welcoming. Very clean, a bit cluttered but I didn’t mind, still very clean and well kept. \n\nLocation is GREAT, BUT that area is very congested. I recommend taking her up on $9 parking/day if you decide to rent a car- otherwise you will need to park elsewhere and walk to the unit. \n\nThe noise wasn’t bad- earplugs are provided if needed. Great restaurants within walking distance and Kalapaki Beach is absolutely beautiful.

The bathroom was great, and there weren't any issues with folks needing the bathroom at the same time (to be honest I was there a whole week and didn't see either of the other guests).  Only issue was when I got in after an 18hr trip at 9pm, the room wasn't cleaned made and I had to wait about 30 mins to get that resolved. \nLife happens, it was just frustrating.

The location is a perfect starting place on the island, in between the North and South shores - I personally preferred travelling to South-West (Waimea ftw! and the alternate route to hwy50 via Hulemalu rd was also a fun drive - but don't head there to go W during rush hour around 4pm as you would have to turn L onto a busy highway) but both directions have their goods. Definitely recommend a car to really explore the island, worth the rental and gas though going past Hanelei is currently closed from last year's landslide. Beach is close by and well taken care of with beach vball courts, surfers to watch and rental equipment available. Lots of towels, boogie boards, etc. are provided - even board games in the home. There is a friendly cat chilling in the place - just be careful to shut your door in case you don't want it coming into your space. A/C is there if you need it, though when I was there opening the window was usually enough with the wind coming through. As to the parking -  there is parking across the bridge (watch out for the pot holes in the lot!) however I found that with people visiting the beach/restaurants, getting parking from 3-8pm (plus I was there from Thurs-Sat) can be very difficult - you may want to consider paying for parking if you might be arriving during these busy times. There is lots of parking farther down past the \"paved\" area but be prepared the HUGE potholes and dirt/water (as you would find at some of the other beach parking lots) . A local warned me not to park in that area overnight because of the risk to the vehicle as well as myself as the area is very dark. Overall, would stay here again if I were travelling by myself - this area is great for the first time traveller so that you can explore or for those who don't get a rental vehicle."}]}

Tudo que conquistei foi graças ao sucesso no Airbnb!\r\n\r\nMinha experiência começou quando recebi um flat da minha avó através de herança (em vida!!), investi pesado na reforma do apartamento para poder oferecer o maior conforto possível aos meus hóspedes. Comecei a administrar seu aluguel e o sucesso foi tão grande que mudou a minha vida!\r\n\r\nMeus amigos e familiares viram como o meu “negócio” estava dando certo e começaram a pedir para que eu também administrasse o aluguel dos apartamentos deles (nessa época ainda não existia a figura do co-host). \r\n\r\nTopei o desafio e o número de apartamentos foi se multiplicando! O resultado foi ótimo e percebi que me sentia muito realizado com as experiências que estava ganhando como empreendedor e ao conhecer pessoas de tantos lugares do mundo! De tal maneira que decidi largar meu emprego como gestor em marketing para me dedicar exclusivamente a vocês!\r\n\r\nFiz um curso de guia de turismo para ter mais conhecimento sobre a cidade e abri a All in Rio, uma Agência de Turismo que oferece tours culturais, naturais e de aventura, além do aluguel de apartamentos de temporada.\r\n\r\nMeu objetivo é oferecer uma estadia segura, confortável e poder fornecer todas as informações necessárias para você desfrutar ao máximo a sua experiência em nossa cidade maravilhosa! \r\n\r\nObrigado pela atenção!\r\n\r\nFabio\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nHi!\r\n\r\nI've been on Airbnb since 2011 and I’m a big fan of the Platform. All I got was thanks to my success on Airbnb!\r\n\r\nMy experience began when I received a flat from my grandmother through inheritance (in life!!). I invested heavily in the renovation of the apartment to be able to offer the greatest comfort possible to my guests. I started managing the rent and the success was so amazing that it changed my life!\r\n\r\nMy friends and family noticed how well my \"business\" was going and started to ask me to manage their apartment’s rent too (at the time, the figure of  the co-host didn’t exist).\r\n\r\nI accepted the challenge and the number of apartments was multiplying! The result was great and I realized that I felt very fulfilled with the experiences I was gaining as an entrepreneur and by meeting people from so many places in the world! So I decided to leave my job as a marketing manager to dedicate myself exclusively to you!\r\n\r\nI took a tour guide course to gain more knowledge about the city and opened the All in Rio, a Tourism Agency that offers cultural, natural and adventure tours, as well as apartments for seasonal rents.\r\n\r\nMy goal is to offer you a safe and comfortable stay and to be able to provide all the information necessary so you can enjoy your experience in our wonderful city to the fullest!\r\n\r\nThank you for your time!\r\n\r\nFabio\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nComments from my guests:\r\n\r\n“This apartment is in the most amazing location. Leblon is beautiful, safe, and packed with fabulous restaurants. The apartment is just by the ocean - couldn't really be better. Communicating with Fabio was super-easy. He was really responsive and helpful. We are missing it already!” - Ed Pilkington (UK)\r\n“Fabio goes far and beyond the average host, my trip was a day earlier than I booked and I would have been stuck with no place to stay but Fabio personally went out of his way to get the place ready for me, great guy and will always go to him first when traveling to Rio. Thank again Fabio abs!!” - Darren Sanford (USA)\r\n“O apartamento é lindo como nas fotos e a localização é perfeita! O Fábio é super atencioso e respondeu super rápido nossas dúvidas. Recomendo muito!” - Bruna Ferrary Deniz (Brasil)\r\n“The apartment was better than we could have imagined. The photos don't do it justice. The place is huge, in a great location. Fabio was a very accommodating host. I would definitely stay there again.” - Jordan Giordano (USA)\r\n“Our stay at Fabio’s place was fantastic! The apartment is simply beautiful and it made us feel at home. Super stylish and cozy. We are very particular about the properties we stay at, and this one exceeded our expectations The apartment description was very accurate! We loved being so close to the beach and all the great restaurants around. Thank you very much!”- Pablo Perez (Canadá)\r\n“Fabio was a perfect host.  He answered promptly all our questions and is a really nice guy!”- Daniela (Brasil)\r\n “Fabio is the perfect host.

Also, the location was great--I would not hesitate to stay here again. The place was so close to public transportation and an IGA to stock up on food. It was clean and spacious. The internet was a bit on the slow side at times, but we could stream Netflix (there was some buffering required).\n\nThere are a few things that I think could be improved. We were two couples staying at the apartment, but we were only supplied with one set of keys and we told we could not have another set. This was very inconvenient for two different couples that wanted to do different things. Also, there was an issue with the oven--we used it to make a frozen pizza, but whoever installed it had left the paper instructions (which were on top of the broiler coil as this is an electric stove) and some other debris in it, like a hard piece of plastic and metal (which were underneath the oven coil at the bottom in the far back corner). We did not see these before we turned the oven on due to their specific locations, so a small fire broke out in the oven. There was no fire extinguisher, so we had to throw water on it. No damage occurred, but it was scary and annoying that no one took these flammable materials out of the oven. Plus there was an awful burning plastic smell after due to the plastic starting on fire. We were lucky the paper instructions did not ignite.

Street parking was not clear where we could park nearby so we parked at Complexe Desjardins nearby for the duration of our stay.\n\nI would stay here again when we visit Montreal.\n"},{"_id":"302418137","date":{"$date":"2018-08-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"25784240","reviewer_id":"26423694","reviewer_name":"Christian","comments":"Robert's place is well located in Montreal, it takes less than 5 min to the next Metro station and less than 10 min to the Old Town. Berri UQAM area, China town and the Quartier de Spectacles are also within walking distance. \nThe place is very spacious and clean, and provided a perfect Homebase for a family of 4 during our stay.

The best thing is going to the beach in 5 minutes, especially early in the morning. Plan on snorkeling and seeing turtles there!\nThere is plenty of parking spots. Don't forget to get your parking permit!\nBeing in Kihei allows to go easily everywhere on the island. One of the best spots to buy food is ABC (2 minutes drive).\nFinally, Mark is easy to contact and replies in minutes to your questions and makes you arrival in Maui event nicer with a nice basket of gifts. He really practices the Aloha! \nIf we ever come back, we will most probably contact him again."},{"_id":"193251906","date":{"$date":"2017-09-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2578814","reviewer_id":"39855046","reviewer_name":"Bastian","comments":"Sehr schöne Wohnung, komplett ausgestattet, tolle Lage (auf der anderen Straßenseite schon der Strand; Restaurants/Kneipen + Einkaufsmöglichkeiten fußläufig erreichbar; Surf-Schulen fußläufig erreichbar).\nHaben uns hier sehr wohl gefühlt. \nVielen Dank für alles!"},{"_id":"198542010","date":{"$date":"2017-09-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2578814","reviewer_id":"132383851","reviewer_name":"Akeyla","comments":"We had a great time at Mark's.

It felt like as though my body was floating on the top of bunch of squicky metal springs. It makes too much noise and sinks here and there.  So don't rely on the sofa bed.

The town of Hanalei, with its restaurants, bars, charming boutiques, and the fabulous beach at Hanalei Bay, is only about a 5 minute drive.  In the summer months, when the water is calm, you can even catch a boat tour of the Na Pali Coast out of Hanalei.  There are numerous hiking trails a short drive away.

The layout isn't typical of an apartment - there was no kitchen per se, but there was a full sized fridge, along with a hot plate and other kitchen supplies if you want to cook in the suite. Alternatively, there is a BBQ in the pool area which you can use. The lanai was large and furnished, and a fan kept the room cool at night. There were also beach chairs, a cooler, towels for guest use, which was excellent. The suite itself was very clean and the bed was comfortable. The only downfall was the parking - if you didn't get there early enough all the non-reserved spaces were full. We got a warning for parking on the grass, with a message that we'd be fined and our tires booted if we did it again. Re: location - Princeville is a super posh resort area and you kind of have to drive to go anywhere cool (e.g. Hanelei) so we didn't love it, but it definitely depends what you are into. There are restaurants, shops and groceries nearby, and the suite is within walking distance to Queen's Bath and Anini beach (long walks, but walks nonetheless).

The Airbnb description of the place is spot on with what you get.  Place has a small kitchenette where you can cook basic meals for breakfast/lunch.  A big dinner may be tough to do since you only have 1 hot plate to work with but there are a couple of grills at the pool that you can use to make a feast if you want.  Location also is very good.  It is less than a 10 minute drive from Hanalei Bay and just a few minutes from Princeville Shopping Center.  You can also drive a few minutes or walk 15 minutes to the ocean, in particular Queen's Bath, which is a beautiful area - just be careful if surf is up and waves crashing high on rocks. You definitely need a car to enjoy the area, though, unless you're willing to wait for bus or good at hitching a ride.\r\n\r\nOverall, we were very happy with the place and would stay here again."},{"_id":"14070729","date":{"$date":"2014-06-10T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2584102","reviewer_id":"5533560","reviewer_name":"John","comments":"Room was exactly as described.

Honestly, we weren't there at the unit much, we just needed a place to sleep, shower, and maybe cook a little bit of breakfast or dinner.  Who needs more than that in beautiful Kauai? There is so much to do and see! We left the unit early each morning, and always managed to be back to by 7 PM, so we didn't have any trouble with the parking. If we needed food after that, we just walked to the market or restaurants in Princeville. We couldn't get the electrical outlet near the sink to work (The most convenient for cooking, or hairstyling devices), but it wasn't important enough for us to contact the owners. It's an apartment complex, and just as you would expect, you can hear people talking and shouting to their friends and kids.

Comfortable and fairly convenient as long as you have a car.  Parking is easy in the lot and the pool is right down the stairs and didn't seem to get too busy.  We were able to use the grill there to BBQ one night and eat at one of the tables by the pool - although, there isn't really enough lighting and it gets buggy, so I can understand people cooking out and carrying back to their flats to eat.  There isn't really any space in the flat to sit or eat though - that is one downside.  For breakfasts we ended up perching on the sofas outside and using the corner of the table that is out on the lanai.  Also the condo management seem quite strict so be careful about leaving your towels out to dry -- we ended up having to go home with a bag full of wet towels and bathing suits because there is no place suitable to hang them to dry.  Other than that, this is good value for the money and you can drive easily into Hanalei (which is much more laid back than Princeville).  Erin was a good hostess - generous and easy to communicate with, and the flat was clean.

As a side note, as with everywhere in Kauai, there are roosters and they can be a tad bit loud in the morning but this is nothing against our hosts! The room is actually quite a bit larger than we were expecting and was well appointed. There are enough kitchen gadgets to make any food you'd like and there are really nice grills out by the pool (which is literally right out your door). The stairway wasn't any longer than any other apartment stairway but it is a tad narrow if you have really large luggage. You do get very nice trade winds coming through and at night we actually found we needed to close the windows as it would get a bit chilly. There were a few days that the trade winds were gone but it didn't make the room unbearable. You are about a 5 minute drive from a Foodmart and about a 15 minute drive from Hanalei!

The pool and hot tub were wonderful for our aching feet. It was a good launching point to explore the rest of the island - we drove to as many parts of the island as possible and were glad we chose to stay in the area we did. It was close to the things and places that we enjoyed the most during our stay. The space was comfortable for us, even without the A/C - there was a good cross wind that kept us cool enough at night and we were usually out and about during the day anyway. The only trouble we had was the neighbors dog - they must have had a new puppy or something but it didn't sleep through one of the two nights we were there, so neither did we. It would have been totally manageable except we needed to leave the windows open to keep the cross-breeze, so we couldn't shut it out by closing them. Someone left a note on their door, so apparently we weren't the only ones disturbed and hopefully it will be figured out soon. Despite that issue, we still give it 4 stars. As many others said, there were plenty of kitchen items to use, and we put them to good use with the amazing fruit available from the fruit stands around, and we enjoyed sitting on the lanai one evening as the rain fell and in the mornings with our tea as the sun came up."},{"_id":"34976170","date":{"$date":"2015-06-14T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2584102","reviewer_id":"32854287","reviewer_name":"Elisabeth","comments":"We stayed at Dan and Erin's place for a weekend and loved it!

Comparable condos in Princeville can be much more expensive, and we found that this condo served our purposes very well. \r\n\r\n2) COOKING FRIENDLY: We like to cook, and that’s why this was even better than staying at a hotel. There are conveniently located supermarkets in Princeville and Hanalei that made it very feasible to cook our own meals. At the condo we used the community BBQ (there are two) and within the room we used their hotplate, full-sized fridge, and microwave. They have plates and cutlery, but don’t expect any common household basics like oil, paper towels, and seasonings. \r\n\r\n3) BEACH ACCESSORIES: They also have a small cooler that we brought to the beach and three beach chairs. They have two sets of towels for both beach and bath. \r\n\r\n4) OTHER AMENITIES: Even though there is no AC, there is one ceiling fan that kept us comfortably cool. We also made use of the community pool and the room’s lanai/porch, which has a couch, multiple chairs and a table. \r\n\r\n5) NOISE LEVEL: It’s a family friendly area and close to the pool, which means it’s not uncommon to hear children and neighbors through the window. On the other hand, this area had very few roosters (which in Kauai, is a rare find). We stayed at other places on the island and had many roosters wake us up, but this was not the case here.\r\n"},{"_id":"46131000","date":{"$date":"2015-09-08T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2584102","reviewer_id":"23914011","reviewer_name":"Darius","comments":"Very nice location for a very reasonable price!

We were up early and out exploring all day long so the hot tub was very nice to have in the evenings for our tired bodies. The only downsides to this unit are by no means the owners fault. Be forewarned Kauai has lots of chickens! This goes for anywhere you stay. Bring earplugs to sleep with if you don't want a 4am wake up call from the dumb rooster who thinks its sunrise. This was to be expected, however the neighbors here have LOTS of children. If you are not an early riser be prepared for squealing and screaming at 7 am sharp. We used it as our alarm clock and didn't mind so much but they are LOUD. Everything else is amazing, lovely balcony clean bathroom tons of cookware and utensils.

We never found a real parking spot but managed to find small corners to wedge our tiny rental car into except one night.  I would love to see a small dining table with a couple of chairs rather than a single large easy chair and ottoman. The porch has a sofa, easy chair, \u0026 rattan chair upon which to lounge. This is where we had to do reading, as there is lighting there. The multi-use sink/food prep area was nice, although small for any real cooking. There is a full size refrigerator, microwave, rice cooker, toaster, electric skillet, hot plate, coffee maker, and toaster, plus a couple plates, cups, glasses, tableware, and cooking utensils. We had to use an extension cord hanging down from the outlet high on the wall because the lower one didn't work. But everything worked out OK. There are two large frying pans to use, so plan meals accordingly. One pan is a badly torn up teflon, which I would never use, so I opted for the badly burned stainless steel. It cooked fine, just looked bad. The downstairs children are a great 7:00 AM alarm "},{"_id":"62511002","date":{"$date":"2016-02-15T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2584102","reviewer_id":"52177265","reviewer_name":"Todd","comments":"The host was very helpful in the whole process (though directions were a bit vague on the final approach).

The location threw us off a bit, as it is nestled in a very nice community surrounded by golf courses and beautifully manicured lawns. While beautiful and convenient to much of the North Shore attractions, it had the feel of a retirement community therefore recommend this space to an older crowd or avid golfers, not necessarily young to mid age travelers. Contrary to other reviews, the kids and chickens were not a problem, as we were up early and stayed during the week, while the kiddos were in school however parking was definitely a thorn in our side as mentioned by a few reviewers. Additionally,  the neighbors were less than friendly, as we overheard a couple unwelcoming comments (seemingly unaware that the room was an airbnb?). The actual space was great. Clean with some dishes and basic appliances and the porch was a great space to enjoy the morning cup of coffee.

Even though it is not a real full kitchen we could always prepare our meals conveniently which saved a lot of money. Also the amenities like the hot tub or the swimming pool were great after a day of hiking.\n\nThe location in Princeville is very convenient to explore the whole island with a rental car (in our eyes you definitely need one here on Kauai). Beautiful beaches such as Hideaways and Ke'e Beach are just a short drive away. \n\nDan and Erin also provided beach chairs and enough towels which was very nice.\n\nBe aware that it can rain a lot on Kauai. However, we always found a way to enjoy our time anyway (for example on the nice lanai). \n\nAll in all it was a perfect week in the private little apartment.

It was clean, reasonably spacious, and well located on the north shore, although not within walking distance of much, which is true of pretty much all of Kauai.  It is relatively close (about a mile) from the only shopping center in the area.\n\nThe hosts communicated well, and everything met our expectations.  In particular, it was very fairly priced, which is important for someone on a budget.  The lanai was very nice to sit out on.  There is also access to a pool, which we did not use.\n\nThe room includes a refrigerator and microwave, but there really isn't a kitchen (there are lots of kitchen utensils, including plates, glasses, cutlery, a coffee maker, etc., and a hot plate which we did not use).  There also really isn't a table at which to eat.  There are grills next to the pool which we believe can be used and would probably be better than trying to cook in the room.\n\nThere is a single sink outside the bathroom.  The bathroom itself was fine, with a good shower.  The hosts supply four bath size towels (two for the bath, two for the beach), but they are getting old and could be replaced.  They also supply two beach chairs, which were very much appreciated.  There is no real closet, but there are hangers and hooks on which to hang things.  There is adequate drawer space for things that don't need to hang.  Our only real issue is that several slats were missing from the vertical blinds on the door to the lanai, reducing privacy.\n\nAlso, there is limited parking -- if you expect to be out late at night, it may be a problem finding a space when you return.\n\nWe enjoyed our stay and would return."},{"_id":"134540052","date":{"$date":"2017-02-27T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2584102","reviewer_id":"9014656","reviewer_name":"Spring","comments":"A"},{"_id":"134896353","date":{"$date":"2017-03-01T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2584102","reviewer_id":"53494530","reviewer_name":"Aubry","comments":"I did not meet Dan \u0026 Erin, but the check in process was simple and easy-with a lockbox code to get into the apartment.

There isn't a dedicated parking spot. We were a little disappointed with the cleanliness. There was dust all over, couple of unclean towels, utensils, dirty shower floor and curtains. The place missed few basic necessities like hand soap, kitchen towel, tissue paper. We were informed of missing toiletries when asked so we were prepared accordingly. Shower is low for tall people.

The hosts were responsive when we asked about the toilet paper and clean towels; the neighbor brought us one more roll (three rolls for a nine day trip for two women) and washed/dried the towels for us.

Huge bang for your buck in terms of what you're getting for going rental rates on the island on AirBnB! If there is any downside at all it's that the location is a bit of a drive from the airport on the South Shore end, otherwise everything was exceptional. Pool/hot tub area on site is far nicer than even the pics posted in the listing give it credit for! Relaxing spot to wind down each night before heading off to sleep. The shower area is spacious! Very big advantage when washing all the sand off from our beach adventures each day! Hot water availability was never an issue. Porch area is a nice amenity, unfortunately it's not screened in so mosquitoes were plentiful out there at night given the time of year we visited (early April) as things were rather damp outside all trip. All necessary amenities were exactly as listed (if not better). Beach chairs and beach cooler were an added bonus that we got full use out of every day. Place is fairly easy to find and parking was never an issue. Cannot beat the price for those looking to get a taste of the North Shore life, as it was only a 5-10 minute drive up to Hanalei Bay and all of its little store fronts/restaurants. Very outdoorsy, more scenic part of the island compared to the other parts and we explored it all!

This studio is in a gorgeous area! We loved that there was a full sized fridge so we had plenty of space for all of our food/drinks/frozen items. (We made a trip to Costco right after the airport). We used the coffee maker everyday.  There were sugar cubes there for our use as well. There is a hot plate which we used several times, another plug in skillet type pan as well which we used multiple times. There was a blender, toaster, I think a rice cooker as well. We cooked at home everyday, it was awesome and definitely a money saver. There is a pool/hot tub/bbq area just steps away from the studio. You MUST bbq! The bbq's are really nice and the pool was awesome. I reget not spending more time in the pool. \n\nHideaway beach is my favorite place on Earth and it's just minutes away from here. The lanai (patio/deck) is amazing, it was a major added bonus.  We really enjoyed spending time out there everyday and it's an awesome place to eat breakfast. \n\nThere wasn't AC which surprisingly was not an issue for us at night. You can keep the sliding door open (with the screen door shut) and there are shutters beside the bed as well as a ceiling fan. We had no issues sleeping! I struggle with sleep normally but I can honestly say I had some of the best sleep in my life here. \n\nA couple of tips - bring your own bar soap/soap for washing hands because there was only a small dish soap. I read previous reviews very carefully so that I could be fully prepared for our stay and someone else had said there wasn't soap. I packed dish soap, hand soap, roll of paper towel, some ziplock bags, and a dish sponge (I didn't see any dish sponge for doing dishes in the studio so I'm glad I brought one) You can easily buy stuff when you are there too, but nothing beats hitting the dollar store and just packing a few things. \n\nIf you enjoy cooking as much as we do AND if you are checking in some luggage at the airport, I highly recommend packing a couple of your go-to chopping/pearing knives. The ones in the BNB are very dull, but we made it work!\n\nI could go on and on about how awesome this place is. I've stayed in Princeville down the street at another studio and it didn't have nearly as much to offer as this place did. I can't wait to come back to Kauai and I would 100% recommend staying here. \n\nMahalo! \n"},{"_id":"315054341","date":{"$date":"2018-08-27T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2584102","reviewer_id":"4174541","reviewer_name":"Diego","comments":"Amazing flat with terrace in a beautiful complex.

Open air parking is available nearby, costing 17 CAD per day (until 6 am of the next day, after that you have to pay another full day). \nOn the negative side, the room can get hot in the summer and the A/C provided was VERY noisy (one of those portable units and it was situated in the living room, so had to put it at full and keep door open to cool the bedroom). The room definitely did not feel like home, with very poor/ cheap decoration and furnishing. Bed was comfortable however. Overall a budget option.

There are two queen beds with comfy comforters and more than enough pillows. He left us 4 clean towels. The kitchen is equipped with everything you need. Theres also a balcony with two chairs. Theres 2 convenience stores right across the street if you need snacks/beer/wine..super close to the heart of dt. Matt responds very quick too. Ubers are very easy to get in the area."},{"_id":"325722252","date":{"$date":"2018-09-20T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"25937713","reviewer_id":"44361176","reviewer_name":"Timothé","comments":"Thanks"},{"_id":"328582131","date":{"$date":"2018-09-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"25937713","reviewer_id":"55384744","reviewer_name":"Kaitlyn","comments":"Great place! Very clean and spacious. Awesome location. The building did have some construction going on, but it wasn’t a bother. The mattress was not the most comfortable thing ever, but I really liked the apartment! A lot of light, full kitchen, and a nice tv!"},{"_id":"331027667","date":{"$date":"2018-10-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"25937713","reviewer_id":"214519022","reviewer_name":"D","comments":"We recently spent a long weekend in Montreal.  We had a wonderful time and part of that was because Matt’s apartment gave us a place to come “home” to at the end of each busy day. The apartment is exactly like the pictures.  There were no bad surprises. It is very difficult to find a place in Montreal that has two distinct beds.... not a couch rollout or a blow up mattress.  This has two identical queen beds, one in the bedroom and one in the large living room. Everything was very comfortable and very clean!  Matt was a great host.  Check in couldn’t have been easier and he responded within minutes to everything we asked. I will be staying there again.  Matt, thank you so much! We had a wonderful time."},{"_id":"332112814","date":{"$date":"2018-10-04T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"25937713","reviewer_id":"217021744","reviewer_name":"Edie","comments":"Great place to stay.

From the moment I booked the Airbnb he was very informative and within the first couple of days of me booking he had already sent the instructions on how to get into the Airbnb followed by some rules. When arrived at the Airbnb it was exactly how it looked in the pictures.  Matt was very helpful when we had a problem turning on the shower i sent him a message and he was at the Airbnb within 5 minutes to help us out! The place was very clean and the beds were very comfortable. The location of the Airbnb was perfect an block away from all food stores and pharmacies and a one minute walk to the metro. Overall,Matt was a great host and I would definitely recommend his place if you are looking to stay a few days in Montreal. Thanks again Matt!"},{"_id":"336601546","date":{"$date":"2018-10-14T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"25937713","reviewer_id":"210691958","reviewer_name":"Olivia","comments":"We were two professionals who stayed at the apartment for 5 nights to attend a conference. The apartment was very conveniently located for our needs (near Concordia University, grocery store, tons of restaurants, and public transportation). It was a safe neighborhood. The apartment itself was okay but spartan (as pictured so true to photos). Two real beds are great feature. No where else to sit though other than uncomfortable folded couch and dining table chairs. Missing some very basic things for any Airbnb place: NO maps, tourist information or instructions on how to use the TV and get into Netflix. Only towel rack was in the shower and NO washcloths or hand towels were provided. We got two large towels each and had to get paper towels from the kitchen to put in the bathroom to dry our hands. The beds were comfortable but don't have top sheets, only a duvet cover. We have to assume and hope that they launder the duvet covers after each guest. It was, on the surface, somewhat clean, although the shower curtain had black mold and there was hair in the drain. There was no stopper for the bathtub.  Items in the kitchen (spatula, fridge, and pan) had remnants of food. The hallway outside of the apartment smelled of fried food the entire week. Really bad smell, which isn't the fault of the host, but may be an issue for some. It was nice to have access to a gym on the top floor. Do not stay here if you are counting on using the garage parking. You need a card to get in and out of the garage, which means you need to park on the street (in a very busy area) on arrival and then departure in order to collect/deposit the card in the apartment. Finally, if a solo traveler or if concerned about safety, be aware that the keys (only one key was left--we had to ask for a second) are left in the unlocked apartment for you to let yourself in after using a code to enter the building. This and parking system are not in the description but should be disclosed before paying so people can make more informed choices. Neither of us would stay here again."},{"_id":"338097217","date":{"$date":"2018-10-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"25937713","reviewer_id":"42532970","reviewer_name":"Hannah","comments":"Very cozy and very good location."},{"_id":"340025403","date":{"$date":"2018-10-22T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"25937713","reviewer_id":"208371824","reviewer_name":"Yuefa","comments":"Matt's appartment is very good and comfortable, very clean and close to supermarket and underground station.
