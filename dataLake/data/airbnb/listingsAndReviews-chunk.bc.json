I had a wedding to go to in Kapalua and the prices at the Ritz were above my pay grade; however, staying at Chris' condo was comfortable, clean and a 4 minute walk to go stand up paddle boarding in between the wedding activities....truly couldn't have planned it more perfectly! The place had all my little favorites: coffee bean grinder, French press, blender for my morning smoothies, and there's even a little trail shortcut Chris talked to me about in order to walk into the Napili Shopping Center where I could walk and grab lunch or a latte in the afternoon. Nice King Bed and clean bathroom. The place is a bit outdated (bathroom \u0026 kitchen tile), but for the price I can't complain at all. Great WiFi and Cable TV was perfect to keep up with my email and chill out at night after all the activities going on. I will definitely hit this place up again because of the amenities, cleanliness and location. Oh yeah, Chris was a great host and definitely knows the area and was easy to get a hold of!

Chris was great with communicating with us, and everything was exactly as described. However, perhaps two things need additional emphasis:\n\n(1) The unit is old. Really old. Not that this bothered us a lot, but this probably should be part of the description. Obviously, at the price that this unit was listed at, we did not expect it to be like the Hyatt or the Marriott, but it was a lot older that we expected.\n\n(2) In the summer months, it gets very uncomfortable. It never got below 80 degrees at night inside the unit, and it was 80% humidity. Even with the two fans blasting at the bed, we never got comfortable ... to a point where we almost checked into a hotel for the last two nights of our vacation. This listing's description noted that this unit does not have an A/C, so we were aware that this might happen. But really, this should be in BOLD ALL CAPS for all summer travelers.

The living room had an air conditioner that cooled the living room and up to the kitchen, but definitely didn't reach the bedroom, which was notably hot and muggy as a result.

AC and ceiling fan in living room only - wholly inadequate for keeping actual bedroom comfortable (no AC and no ceiling fan).  The bed was comfortable but this was a very minimalist lodging at best.  One of the biggest frustrations we had was trying to get the host to email/text or message the door code before we arrived in Maui.  We had an incredibly busy morning flying from Oahu and after the host refused to send me the code after asking several times in email, he called my mobile while I was navigating to the airport on Oahu - I missed my exit and almost missed the flight trying to just get the code and get off the phone.

This space has a full kitchen which was amazing for us because we were able to save some money by going to the store just 2 mins from our room and made breakfast and lunch. One of the most comfortable beds Ive ever stayed on in a hotel/Air b. So props for that. The only constructive criticism I have for this B and B is there was only one black out curtain. while we woke up at 6 am every morning anyways, night time you could literally see into our room, and a few staff members saw the goods, unfortunately. I personally didn't care that much but I imagine a woman in her 40s or a young girl wouldn't want to be exposed like this. Blackout curtains in rooms are KEY. Also there was no AC unit in the room so if you dont mind using fans and dont spend too much time in the room then it won't be a problem!

Additional black out curtains and kitchen shades would be nice as lawn crews can see straight into the kitchen and bed area.

Tons of shops and restaurants very close by. The subway is only a 7 min walk away. The place was very clean and tidy and looks just like the pictures. Alex was very friendly and offered us tips about some great places to check out. It does get quite hot in the apartment since there is no air conditioning. The room gets direct sun for most of the day and the curtains are quite sheer. There was a table fan in the bedroom that helped a bit but we didn’t sleep well. The bed was smaller than I expected. It looked like a queen in the photos but it was a double so its a bit snug for 2 people if you are used to stretching out when sleeping.  It sits on a large piece of wood on the frame instead of a box spring, so it creaks loudly anytime someone moves. We also found the pillows to be very thin. Overall though for the price  it was a good deal. If you are looking for a budget place to stay I would recommend staying here as you can’t beat the location!

His place is on the second floor apartment with an outdoor staircase (typical in Montreal) and is pretty cool. His apartment is all brand new and renovated. we instantly felt like home. It’s centrally located and the train station is within a couple of blocks and possibly a 5-10 min walk (longer for us because we had my parents and a stroller in tow lol). The parking signs in Montreal is pretty confusing but we had a lot of help from the neighbors who explained it to us. We had no problem finding parking literally across the street from the apartment. \n\nWhat was also great was the lockbox! We didn’t have to wait for him to enter or to leave him the key. communication was effortless and he always answered our questions in a timely matter.  The apartment had everything you needed to literally feel comfortable. \n\nOverall, we would def. come back and stay at his Airbnb and highly recommend it!

But there were slopes and stairs from the station so it may be tough if you don't like walking. I myself enjoyed walking up and down the starirs looking around the lovely shops.\nThe apartment is 30m2 (400 or 450ft?) of size 1BdRm. The room is super clean and tasteful and gorgeous. New and deluxe kitchen appliances are furnished like the refrigerator, the microwave, the stove, and washing machine, so I felt comfortable very much. The quilts of the beds were comfortable as well. We two slept one on the sofa bed in the living room and one on the bed in the bedroom. The sofa bed was enough big and comfortable so I slept very well. There is no bathtub (Japanese prefer bathtub so it might be disappointed to Japanse), and unfortunately, It was difficult to have constant hot water from the shower since the procedure was complicated. My friend had struggled to take a hot water.\nThe host responded very quickly and kindly and his responses were very helpful.

It was a family trip with my parents, younger brother, wife and our toddler aged 2 years and an infant just 3 months old; the reason I detail our group is to mention how perfect the apartment is for large families. The highlight is the living room which is just like in the photos, well laid out and large - giving us and the kids ample space to spend quality time whilst in the flat. \n\nMehmet as a host has been extremely friendly and supportive - we had a few instances when if it were not for Mehmet's very responsive nature to calls and messages, we would have had a difficult time. Once when my younger brother had fallen ill with very high fever late into the night, I had contacted Mehmet and he immediately provided details of the nearest hospital and also offered to talk to the Taxi driver once we are in the car. What was more personal, was when he cared to check up on my brother the next day and asked how was keeping. \n\nWe also had an incident when unfortunately my wife's wallet was pickpocketed, and it contained the flat keys. I was quite distressed as the kids were tired and it was at the end of a long day. Just one call, and although Mehmet was in Izmir, within 10 min he had arranged his sister to drop the spare keys to the flat. \n\nThank you very much Mehmet for your prompt support, we really appreciate it and I am delighted I chose a wonderful host. I would strongly recommend Mehmet's flat to future Istanbul visitors, there is a Carrefour market downstairs, the bus stand is just 1 min walk away. One small word of caution, do travel light! The flat is on the third floor or spiralling stairway, on normal days we had no issues at all - guess being a large family trip we came with way too many suitcases - the move in and move out took some energy out of me! :-)"},{"_id":"317980531","date":{"$date":"2018-09-03T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"24296834","reviewer_id":"57296033","reviewer_name":"Ali","comments":"Before anything - Mehmet is a great communicator: he immediately shared his (Hidden by Airbnb) number, and we clarified the location, check-in process (as our flights were at awkward hours) and everything.

Taksim Metro is only 10 minutes walk from the house\nThe apartment is spacious and fairly clean \nThe Host (Mehmet) is very communicative and responds quickly to the messages\nHe helped us to take our luggages upstairs and to book a taxi to the airport. \nVery Good value for the good price\n\nCons\nThe apartment is on the 3rd/4th floor with alot of steep stairs. It is hard for older people to climb up the stairs and it is hard if you travelling with heavy luggage. My mother clearly was not happy with the stairs. \nMehmet was so kind and help us to move our luggages upstairs but we had to bring them all down ourselves  on departure. \nsmell of sewerage in the apartment in some occasions , but it was not that bad to handle. You could get rid of it by opening the windows or smoking a nice incense."},{"_id":"341937295","date":{"$date":"2018-10-28T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"24296834","reviewer_id":"82403090","reviewer_name":"Brenton","comments":"A great place to stay.

On top of this, the flat offers several amenities that really make it good value, these include: a roof terrace two floors above, balconies and a sit down shower! \nThe flat is equally very well located with several landmarks such as the Galata tower only a short walk away. The surrounding area is buzzing and necessities such as grocery stores and shops are very close by.

The beds were comfortable and we slept well. Breakfast was more than adequate, in fact, everything exceeded our expectations for a hotel in this price bracket. Salih and his team are able to arrange anything and provided us with good advice and tips on what and what not to do. We were travelling with my elderly mother who has mobility issues but she managed the location without difficulty: turn left out of the hotel up the steep hill and keep climbing until you hit the street with trams OR turn right and walk to the mosque along mostly level roads then walk back up the tram road from the Blue Mosque and then down to the hotel - easy. And DO check out the newly opened Roman cistern  just up the hill. Discovered in 2010 it is smaller than the Cistern Basilica but equally impressive and the crowds haven’t discovered it yet; we were the only visitors to this vast underground space with towering columns."},{"_id":"409592126","date":{"$date":"2019-02-08T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"24298167","reviewer_id":"99675442","reviewer_name":"丹丹","comments":"房间不错,挺大的,设施也比较新,位置很好,离蓝色清真寺非常近｡半夜到的飞机,前台很热情的接待我们｡推荐"}]}

Besides us, there has been another German couple living with us for a couple of days in the 2nd room. Friendly people, although it might have been nice to know up front who else we'd be sharing the apartment with.

After several experiences with AirBnB, i realized that not only is this the new way to travel, but it is also an excellent opportunity to network with different people from all over the world! I love travelling, and the prospect of meeting new people from around the world makes AirBnB an awesome experience for myself and my roommates.\r\n\r\nOne of my best trips so far was a roadtrip across the United States. I have made this trip twice and it's amazing to see how peoples' lives vary across the country. We met many travellers along the way through AirBnB, which really inspired me to set up something similar in my own home.\r\n\r\nMost recently, I travelled to the United Kingdom as an exchange student and during the weekends, I backpacked around Europe.

I would just note that there can be up to 6 other guests during your stay, alongside 2 long term houseguests. While there we had 10 people to one bathroom which was a lot, but if your comfortable with shared spaces between a lot of people then I definitely recommend Williams place especially for the price.

The hosts are also incredibly kind and helpful and gregarious. Of course, at this incredible rate, one shouldn't be expecting something comparable to a grand hotel.\n\nI did hear some late night TV noise that I wasn't sure whether came  from the other Airbnb guests or from the unit upstairs. It prevented me from sleeping earlier than I had hoped. Also, I got whiffs of cigarette smoke, again, not sure whether from within the unit from other Airbnb guests or the neighbors outside of the unit.\n\nI was able to sleep well, however, once I fell asleep. \n\nAs the unit has several rooms, you will need to share the bathroom and won't be allowed to leave any personal items in the bathroom. It was nice to have access to a kitchen with some room in the fridge.\n\nThe location is fairly convenient as you will be near a bus stop and are about twenty-minutes walk to the nearest Metro Station.

So needed the place  with a car park, and no far from the center. Gundega and Antonio apartment is ideal  location. 10 minutes’ walk to any of two nearest metro stations, then 10 minutes by metro to Porto center. And you are free to test port at all Porto  vine cellars! Apartment is big, fully equipped; kitchen is perfect, fridge, freezer, toaster, coffee maker and cattle. Washing machine (we used it). The bed in master bedroom is great; mattress is hard enough, like our one at home. And   true thing – we really felt like at our friend home. Gundiga and Antonio met us at the apartment, guided us through all the facilities, gave us the map and filled with advice on where to go at Porto. So just do not spent time in Web – Antonio will tell you all and more! They both are with perfect English, and even with some Russian, so no problems with communications.  Spent just two days there, and that was a pity. Hope to come next time, and hope Gundega and Antonio will allow us in. Aaaaa – huge shopping center near by for food, port to take home, and shopping in general."},{"_id":"260054544","date":{"$date":"2018-05-03T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"24404723","reviewer_id":"47171884","reviewer_name":"Miriam","comments":"Todo perfecto!

Fomos muito bem recebidos pelo Antonio, que nos mostrou o apartamento e deu excelentes dicas para aproveitarmos a região. A localização é muito boa, com super mercados e estações de metrô nas proximidades, e de carro ou taxi chega-se rapidamente ao centro do Porto. Estávamos em um grupo de 4 pessoas e utilizamos a cama do quarto e o sofá-cama da sala. O apartamento tem ainda duas casas de banho. A limpeza estava impecável e havia na casa absolutamente tudo que poderíamos precisar. Embora estivéssemos de carro, optamos por não utilizar a vaga na garagem visto que o estacionamento na rua é gratuito no final de semana, e há sempre vagas disponíveis em frente ao prédio. Tivemos vontade de ficar um pouco mais ao fim da nossa estadia, pois foi com toda certeza uma das melhores experiências que tivemos no airbnb.

Two contact numbers were provided but the host number is in the Phillipines and unreachable, second number     was a Hong Kong number but not the host and hard to reach- spent 10-15mins calling and calling at 10pm (lucky I was able to borrow a phone). Apartment was not cleaned after the last guest but we didn’t realise - just thought it was a poor job (turns out the cleaner was sick and forgot, but it is the host’s responsibility to check that cleanliness is acceptable before their next guest arrives) - we used someone else’s used towels and sheets. I have photos to prove the apartment was not clean. Host sent cleaner the next morning but a communication issue with my mum meant that we didn’t realise she was there because the towels and sheets were not clean, and Mum told her it’s ok (obviously if my mum had realised we had used towels she would want clean towels). Realised the issue afterwards and said of course we want new towels and sheets (we dried ourselves with our clothes that night). Cleaner came sometime after lunch the next day, and did a good job (got new towels and sheets). Mark said he’ll give a refund for the first night for all the inconvenience and disgusting fact we used unclean towels but I have not received this yet nearly a month later. \n\nThat said, some pros. Place is big by Hong Kong standards but it is sparsely furnished. The chairs we had didn’t have any legs to them. Hot water was really good. Location really good with lots of food nearby. Mark sent a cleaner at the end of our first week to  give the apartment a clean (we stayed for two weeks) - that was a nice surprise (but would also be good if he let us know a cleaner will be coming). He also sent some restaurant suggestions towards the end of our stay."},{"_id":"240758496","date":{"$date":"2018-03-06T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2442588","reviewer_id":"103557782","reviewer_name":"Daniel","comments":"Magical place, discovering sheungwan and central district from mark's place is an amazing experience, I fully recomend him."},{"_id":"273382095","date":{"$date":"2018-06-06T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2442588","reviewer_id":"22224314","reviewer_name":"Rosemary","comments":"Lovely apartment in excellent and well serviced neighbourhood.

It was very clean and had everything we needed. Mark sent us suggestions for places to eat around and there is a 7 eleven across the street. As well, there was a place to exchange money directly across the street and the MTR was two blocks away with a grocery store right next to it. This place has easy access to many things and is a beautiful place to stay. \n\nThe only negatives are that there were a few things falling apart in the apartment - the shower head fell off the wall and a door to one of the closet was a little loose.

The location is great, only 15 min away from central and from the port to Macau. It’s also near the HongKong University. Quite a few restaurants and groceries around, McDonald’s and 7-11 are just across the roads. The rooms are newly decorated with sufficient furnitures. The photos are a bit confusing, those old ones should be deleted on home page. Mark makes everything ready for our arrival, the sofa bed is made and there are also chocolates and water. It’s comparatively spacious with one big bedroom and one living room. You know it’s in HongKong. It would be perfect if there is some more towels ( only two offered for our 6 days’ stay but we were pre-advised by Mark, so we are fine) and the shower head can be better positioned (the shower room is new and clean). Response from Mark is not prompt but still timely. Thanks for everything! We have a good holiday!"}]}

We were told no, that we could not drop our bags, for the cleaners safety. This was very strange since we have hundreds of reviews, have been hosting an Airbnb in Manhattan and other cities for nearly 10 years, are superhosts (not to mention one of us is an NYC attorney, weighs 93 lbs/42 kilos and only owns 5 inch plus heels and dresses and such and looks quite dressed up and out of place in Sydney to begin with, I only wear fitted trousers and loafers, so neither of us exactly look like the sort that would be intimidating any cleaners), and since we are Airbnb hosts/guests. \nShe stated that clearly we must understand this ourselves, so we replied that we absolutely always (at no additional charge) do our best to accommodate guests checking in early or checking out late, and that even on same day turns, we do this, and we absolutely always allow people to drop off their bags even before the cleaner has cleaned or if she is there so that they don’t have to carry them around with them and may enjoy their limited time in the cities in which we host (mind you on two continents).\n\nShe continued to state that surely we understand, which obviously we made clear that we did not, but okay, we will drop our bags at the 3 pm check-in time and sit around with them nearby until then.\n\nWe then checked in and realized no fans were provided. There is a ceiling fan in the bedroom but the living room gets no circulation at all (faces a wall), so on hot days and nights it gets very stuffy. Also, it is a pocket wifi, not a proper modem, so do not expect great wifi. We continually received error pages, directing us to the internet providers information site (ie the sort you get if you haven’t paid your bill or have run out of data). Annie states in her informational section in the flat and on Airbnb the Wi-Fi is quite poor in Australia and Sydney, but we visit Sydney every year and usually rent a townhouse in Paddington (unfortunately has been sold since last year and this was a very last minute New Year’s Eve trip), and obviously had switched from another flat which was just a five minute walk away, and have never had any issues with Wi-Fi previously.\nThe host did send us a partial refund for this, upon a few reminders (I should add that she had stated when we checked in that we could extend a day, as they had an empty day before their next booking, but then after we had complained about the Wi-Fi and she offered us ~US$35 as a credit, she stated that we could not extend a day, and that is when we again reminded her about the WiFi credit extended, as we had planned to put it towards our additional day). \n\nThe roof is not really usable, as it is so small with a giant laundry hanging rack that fills the majority of it and the rest is filled with a table, so the one time we tried to use it, it was pretty awkward as if anyone else is up there, not only is all the space taken but it’s kind of awkward to have to say sorry and turn right back around as you basically walk right into them. Plus they’re over your head (the flat is on the top floor), so you hear them walking around and moving the table and such, but obviously sound isn’t a huge issue coming from Manhattan. \nThere isn’t a view by any means, so we really missed the roof we’d moved from. \n\nFinally, Annie, the manager, messaged us the day prior to leaving just to remind us we had to be out by 10am. Sorry, but not only is 10am early (which didn’t matter as we had a flight to catch anyway), but messaging on your final day kind of puts you in a bad mood telling you to be out so early (and not politely either). As hosts, we always message the morning of check out, so as to respect the fact that guests might be trying to enjoy their final day and don’t want to sour any final time.  \n\nIts a shame other hosts can be so rigid and inhospitable, in so many ways."},{"_id":"405268387","date":{"$date":"2019-01-26T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"24460520","reviewer_id":"10908545","reviewer_name":"Derek","comments":"Julia’s place was great for my stay!

The Potts Point neighborhood has loads of great restaurants and shopping as well.

Good lighting.\nLots of dishes and great nonstick pan.\n\nThe cons:\nNoise late at night and early in the morning.\nBeing right at the bottom of the staircase means you hear everyone going up and down the stairs at all hours.\nBeing near the main entrance,  you hear the front door constantly slamming.\nThe location of the building is great however the traffic is fairly loud. Not recommended for light sleepers unless you can sleep with earplugs.\nConstruction noise from the building during the day.\nThe host was good at responding (a plus) except when I got there for check in and couldn't get a reply.

This place is much larger then the photos make it look.  Each bedroom has a queen sized bed and there is room for a Pack N Play/Camping bed for a small child in either bedroom.  The master bedroom has it's own full bathroom.  \nThe view from the 4th floor is stunning at Sunset and it is a quiet neighborhood at night.  Parking is free out front or Isabel has 1 free parking spot in the underground parking area.  \nThere is a grocery store on the street level of the apartment building or you can walk/drive to the Jumbo which is not far away.  \nThe beach is a little far to walk to, but it can be done or a 5 minute drive will get you there.  Parking is free on either side of the main beach road.  This is where you will find restaurants, bars, many kilometers of bike/walking path, and for those with children there are play areas designed for them.  \nThe best part of this place is that it is only a 12 minute drive to parking areas where you can walk onto a bridge that will take you into the center of Porto.  We did not use the local bus, but there is a bus stop very close to the apartment.  It may require you to transfer to another bus or the Metro line in order to get into Porto's center.  \nI highly recommend this apartment, especially if you want to stay near the center of Porto, but have a more peaceful neighborhood experience."},{"_id":"336492957","date":{"$date":"2018-10-14T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"24511562","reviewer_id":"67865291","reviewer_name":"Romina","comments":"Todo estuvo muy bien"},{"_id":"340237440","date":{"$date":"2018-10-23T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"24511562","reviewer_id":"29821403","reviewer_name":"Alejandra","comments":"el piso es amplio y confortable, no recomiendo a  Isabel como anfitriona pues tiene muy malos modos de relacionamiento,  con actitud incrimidatoria e insultante. lamentamos mucho la estancia en ese lugar"},{"_id":"342731128","date":{"$date":"2018-10-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"24511562","reviewer_id":"55933972","reviewer_name":"Eric","comments":"superbe appartement, bien équipé. \narrêt de bus a 100m.

Perfect for a people travelling on work. They had 4 wifi connections I could switch which made working super easy. The most important part is that the hosts were very flexible my flight landed at 530am and they were ready for my call and allowed the checkin at 7 am which was a complete delight. Since I was travelling solo it was a very important consideration. It’s safe but I’d probably move a little more central if I were to travel solo here.

Thanks, Andrea, for making our stay in New York so pleasant."},{"_id":"95127082","date":{"$date":"2016-08-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2453739","reviewer_id":"25939269","reviewer_name":"Kristin Canonizado","comments":"Beside the great view on the Manhattan skyline, the appartment is absolutely lovely, it's bright, it's nicely decorated, comfortable and clean. We should really feel like home and so it was. My nephew was so excited to be playing with all the toys there. Andrea was super friendly and helpful all the time, whenever we had any questions, she answered us as quick as possible. \r\nYou only have a short walk to the train station, to the supermarket across the street, you find everything you need just in the streets near the appartment. We really fell in love with this part of Brooklyn. You have plenty of water playgrounds, so it's really a good place, if you're planning to travel with kids. To find a parking there is also not a big deal. We would definitely come back again.

Al is an excellent host.  He was very responsive to my emails and questions.  Let us drop the bags off early.   Al recommended a really good Indian restaurant Bombay Heights around the corner from the apartment, we took friends that live in Brooklyn there and everyone loved it.    Al also told us where to find a near by grocery store.  The apartment is roomy, has everything you need, and looks just like the pictures; however, the apartment could use a little refresh in places.  I would recommend Al's basement apartment to anyone, unless you only stay in four star hotels.   It not that but it is affordable and nice.   Thanks to Al for letting us stay.

We had a problem with ants coming in and again William couldn't do enough to help. Overall the accommodation is good, we chose to get a small kettle because one wasn't supplied and us Brits like tea and not just coffee. We have bequeathed the kettle to the next residents. Flat was very clean and comfy, a bit dark but then it is a basement flat and that is really to be expected. In the Bed Stu part of Brooklyn the flat is in an okay road, didn't feel unsafe, my best description that the area is an up and coming area that isn't quite up and coming yet. The subway G line is literally just around the corner which made getting into Manhatten very easy.\r\nIf we had problems we just used (Hidden by Airbnb) to contact William and he was always willing to help. Overall the accommodation did what it said on the tin and was fine. AL got in touch to see that we had arrived and had no problems but it was the lovely William that we dealt with if we needed something. The kitchen utensils were adequate but for example we tried to cook pasta and there was no colander to drain the pasta. The cups provided were small cups for coffee. There were no mugs, we actually brought two so that we could have a hot drink. I would say that the kitchen is adequate but not more than that. This of course could be an American thing so I realise I might not be comparing like for like.\r\nThis isn't a moan as such this is more of an observation.\r\nWe booked a shuttle to take bring us to the flat from Newark Airport. Please be warned that Brooklyn from Newark Airport is not exactly cheap, nor is getting a yellow cab from Manhatten to Brooklyn. Going down to DUMBO and the Brooklyn Bridge is a must, the Manhatten Skyline from across the East River is just amazing. Overall it was a good stay and a good choice of flat to stay in. What would be good for the future would be to have a flat manual about the running of the flat, when the rubbish is collected, how the air con works, what channels are available on the tv. Where the best grocery stores are etc.\r\nPlease note that it was my choice to get the kettle and the mugs, I didn't involve William or Al in the decision. I only mention it because some people might think it a disadvantage."},{"_id":"94531036","date":{"$date":"2016-08-16T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"245574","reviewer_id":"87508518","reviewer_name":"Guy","comments":"Came here for aweek long family vacation in the city.

Al was very attentive and communicative, especially when there was an issue with the place. He was also flexible with us for arrival and check-out which was great. There is a lot of noise that travels from upstairs so it did make it difficult to sleep a couple nights, but not an issue if you're not a sensitive sleeper. Other than that the place looks great, is comfortable, accessible and was just a tiny bit musty because it's so humid right now.  You can tell that Al really cares about his place and guests and that means a lot to me - I'm happy we got to meet in person."},{"_id":"207588146","date":{"$date":"2017-10-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"245574","reviewer_id":"54027090","reviewer_name":"Anne","comments":"Accueil très sympathique en toute simplicité.

Supermarkt ist fußläufig zu erreichen. In etwa 40 Minuten ist man mit einem Umstieg in Manhattan. Al selbst war nicht im Lande, hatte aber seinen sehr hilfsbereiten und freundlichen Vater als Ansprechpartner vor Ort.\n\nLeider ist das vorhandene Schlafsofa beim besten Willen nicht nutzbar. Daher ist eine Belegung mit maximal 3 Personen (einer kann dann auf dem nicht ausgezogenen Sofa schlafen) möglich. Auch die sonstige Ausstattung ist sehr einfach und in die Jahre gekommen, vor allem das Badezimmer, die Warmwasserversorgung war aber einwandfrei. Man arrangiert sich ja irgendwie. Als die Toilette mehrmals verstopft war, bekamen wir sehr nette Hilfe von Als Vater; als die Wasserleitung dann eingefroren war, mussten wir uns mit einem Eimer behelfen. Okay, da ist man machtlos.\n\nFazit: Wer Komfort erwartet ist hier falsch. Wer eine einfache, für New Yorker Verhältnisse preiswerte Unterkunft sucht und keine hohen Ansprüche stellt, kann hier buchen. Insgesamt hatten wir eine gute Zeit in New York."},{"_id":"243638906","date":{"$date":"2018-03-16T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"245574","reviewer_id":"16137742","reviewer_name":"Sebastien","comments":"Appartement dans un quartier résidentiel agréable\nProche de toutes commodités (Metro, shopping, restaurants)\nAl est très réactif et arrangeant\nNous avons passé une bonne semaine à New York depuis ce lieu"},{"_id":"245256582","date":{"$date":"2018-03-21T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"245574","reviewer_id":"37571770","reviewer_name":"Sara","comments":"Welcoming host.

Maybe not the prettiest neighborhood, but it was safe and super close to the subway. Easy access anywhere we wanted to go. \n\nCheck in:\nOur plane schedule was all over the place, and we had a tight window of time to get from JFK to the the AirBNB back to the US Open. Al was completely understanding and rolled with all the updates. Keypad worked, and we were able to accomplish it all and not be late! So grateful for a host that can understand the insanity of travel plans and be accommodating. \n\nSpace:\nHuge ground floor of a brownstone. I don't think the pictures really convey how large this space is. Cute, tucked away bed in almost a sun room of sorts was perfect for sleeping. The huge living room and dining room really made it feel like a home instead of some studios we've stayed at. We could lounge on the couches, or eat at the dining table. AC worked well and also worked as white noise for sleeping. Bathroom is kind of an awkward shape, but totally manageable and worked fine. \n\nHospitality:\nWe were already thrilled at the flexibility for check-in, but were also greeted with refreshments and a sign that let us know all the important info for the place.

She helped us get settled in and showed us where we could get groceries, coffee, etc. She showed us very clearly what was available in the apartment and any little 'quirks' we needed to know. The apartment itself is great! Very clean, with two good beds, and a small kitchen that had everything we needed. Very comfortable living and dining area too. And a lovely patio as well! Yulia even had milk, tea, and coffee for us, and a few other bits and pieces we could use, which we found very convenient. Within just 2-5 min walking distance are lots of shops, cafes, and groceries. Yulia was very responsive via (Hidden by Airbnb) throughout.

Местами тяга к художественности портит впечатление от реальнности ( в квартире одно красное кресло!))) За окнами сразу окна другого дома. Светильники около кравати поменялись на более простые.\n\nНемного смутило отсутствие сушилки для больших полотенец, если учесть 6 постояльцев то совсем плохо.

She even allowed us to check in early due to our early flight arrival, and provided us with another bed because we were a family of five. She was extremely helpful and accommodating!! The airbnb was much bigger than we expected from the photos, which was a plus. I'm very picky when it comes to cleanliness (especially the bathroom), and everything was super clean. The airbnb is super close to both metro and the train station, which was both literally down the street. There is a little super market on the same block for water or snacks if you need to buy, which was very convenient.  I really recommend this place if your planning a trip to Barcelona!

It was really easy to go to the CBD by the train, Milsons Point station is only 10min walking (and then 1 stop to go to Town Hall) or you can still walk on the bridge to go to Circular Quay.  The kitchen is really well furnished with a big fridge, microwawe, oven, and gas hotplate. We had a really good time, the area is really quiet, some convenience stores are really close to the apartment and there is a COLES and ALDI in North Sydney around 10min walking.

We give honest reviews!!! This place was booked because of the location and other reviews. We came to Australia to celebrity our 25 th wedding anniversary, trip of our life!  We were checked in with Steve who was very accommodating and pleasant. He pointed out that the carpet is old but clean. It really does have ripples in it from being so old. I thought, no biggie, we can live with that. Over the course of the first 24 hours of our stay many more red flags surfaced. You cannot turn on the hot water in the kitchen if anyone is using the shower- immediately it goes cold. The oven is weird, no directions on how to use it either. The kitchen floor is not tacked down! Looks lovely in the pictures but it is just splashed down. I walked on it in my bare feet and it came up! Underneath is disgusting!  The carpet in the bedroom has a big burn mark in it, which was covered by a bath mat. The bed is hard, not comfortable at all. There was an air mattress on top of the cabinet in the bedroom but it’s too small for the bed. The couch is good looking but has painful springs poking up in 2 cushions. One odd thing is in the bedroom there are side table on either side of the bed, which is nice. The dresser is tucked into the corner, but the side table makes it impossible to open the bottom drawers of the dresser. Awkward!  The kitchen utensils were disgusting and we had to wash everything before we used it.  The cabinet under the sink is awful as well. We hope this place improves because the location is wonderful."}]}
