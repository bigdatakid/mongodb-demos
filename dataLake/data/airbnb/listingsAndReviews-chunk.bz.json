The only thing that bothers me at first when I walked  in was the noise but then you just get used to it and do not pay that much attention . Overall great experience,  nice place,  helpful host. Thank you very much Andre! Definitely will recommend it to family and friends!"},{"_id":"53342978","date":{"$date":"2015-11-08T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7340902","reviewer_id":"29092995","reviewer_name":"Christian","comments":"Had a good week in Andres appartment. It is fully equipped - had everything I needed and was nice and clean when I got there. It is in a nice neighbourhood with loads of shops and food and there is a subway station just at the corner of the street so it is easy to get to anywhere in New York really and also easy to get there from both JFK and La Guardia. The only downside was the elevated subway passing by the appartment every 5-10 minutes. That was quite noisy. I only met Andre when I arrived. But he seemed like  a good guy and readily got back to me whenever I contacted him and always answered my questions."},{"_id":"55413945","date":{"$date":"2015-12-01T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7340902","reviewer_id":"7064368","reviewer_name":"Lisa","comments":"Andre è stato davvero gentile con noi anche se non lo abbiamo incontrato. ..purtroppo siamo arrivate in ritardo all'incontro per le chiavi perché il nostro volo era molto in ritardo! \nL'appartamento è davvero confortevole e vicinissimo alla metro e in un quartiere tranquillo!

The living room is in a converted Garage space, which is very cold when we stayed there in March 2016. I'm sure in the summer months it will be warm. But for the price, this is a very good option. The only downside is that the address isn't clear so most taxi drivers believe it's located outside Porto and on arriving we gave the address Maria gave us to to a taxi driver. The first one told us it was outside Porto, knowing it was centrally located, we tried another taxi driver who programmed the address into the sat nav. Unfortunately there are two streets named the same and we were taken to the furthest away. Even though the driver realised his mistake he charged us 27 euros and got very nasty about it. It should've been a 6 euro journey!! The other issue we had in the apartment was that the fuse box kept tripping. We were able to fix it ourselves but just a word of caution. The accommodation is a great choice though if you're on a budget and you get a taxi driver who knows where he's going!

Porto est une très belle ville ou se côtoient comme souvent en ville, mais peut être ici plus qu'ailleurs, beaux bâtiments et bâtiments abandonnés, luxe et pauvreté.  L'appartement est conforme aux descriptions et est très bien. Il y a tout (linges fournis, fer à repasser, grille pain....) Il ne manque rien. Il y a d'inévitables petits problèmes (chaise desserrée, poignée desserrée) qui ne gâchent pas le séjour. La chambre coté rue est effectivement passagère et donc un peu bruyante malgré la fenêtre double vitrage. La faute en revient à la ville qui continue de revêtir certaines rues passagères de pavés, là ou un béton bitumineux ferait l'affaire. Au final, le bilan est très positif.

La habitacion de las literas es bastante desagradable. Además llegamos a las 21.30 y por un incidente que el propietario no se percató, no estaba la casa limpia, camas usadas, etc. Este punto lo solucionaron enviando inmediatamente alguien que lo limpiara. Creo que la casa necesita un buen lavado de cara y ropa de hogar más higiénica. Detalles como un bote de jabón en el baño que usa todo el mundo, tampoco nos pareció bien, pues no cuesta nada poner unidosis o decir que cada uno lleve su gel. Las colchas no estaban recién lavadas, estaban usadas.

The first impressions as soon as you get there is that the flats do look better in the pictures, but you soon grow to love them and appreciate them.\r\n\r\nThere was 12 of us (we were celebrating my 30th) so the reason why we picked these flats is that we were concerned about being too noisy.  We looked at other locations and they all had very clear noise warnings, whereas there didn't seem to be any mention of that on this profile. However when we arrived we were told we had to make sure we kept our noise levels down, as neighbours didn't particularly enjoy tourists and  would call the police if it got too noisy (for which you'd have to pay a hefty fine). \r\n\r\nHaving said that, no one complained.

It’s super close to La Sagrada Familia, which has a metro station which proved to be extremely useful to get around the city. It is also very close to a small grocery and convenience store, which was also useful. And it’s close to some restaurants, my favorite of which is el Meson de los Ancares.\n \nWe were a group of eleven and got two apartments, one right above the other, both of them with elevator access. The apartments were super comfortable for all of us. We didn’t really use the kitchen, so there’s not much I can say about that. But we used the washing machine, which proved to be invaluable. There is some space outside to hang the clothes dry, but a trick that helped us immensely was to simply hang it inside and use the provided floor fan. In just an hour or two, the clothes would be completely dry. We got our laundry done and it took us no time at all (quick tip, make sure you close the washer’s door tight; it won’t run otherwise :)).\n \nThe other super convenient thing was the wifi internet. It’s nothing super fast, but it proved to be very useful. The location is also very accessible via taxi. In fact, you can easily hail a taxi in a few minutes by walking around the block. Or you can use apps like mytaxi to get one on demand.\n \nOverall, an extremely convenient apartment, and the check-in process was so smooth and delightful, that it really set a good tone for our stay. I highly recommend it. Me and my group are very happy with our choice, and it was a very relaxing and valuable place for a very busy schedule. I would definitely choose it again.\n"},{"_id":"155327620","date":{"$date":"2017-05-28T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"73683","reviewer_id":"62618036","reviewer_name":"Lisa","comments":"Great accommodation with loads of space for a gang to get together and enjoy Barcelona -the accommodation is spacious and practical with 2 bedrooms in each apartment -1double bed in 1room and 1triple bunk in the other -little balcony also makes a lovely addition \nBathroom was traditional in style but hot water was plenty and it was clean -plenty of towels to take from also so home away from home for sure "},{"_id":"157950502","date":{"$date":"2017-06-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"73683","reviewer_id":"78774277","reviewer_name":"Justine","comments":"Logement idéal pour un weekend Barcelonais !"},{"_id":"158698200","date":{"$date":"2017-06-08T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"73683","reviewer_id":"69561321","reviewer_name":"Amy","comments":"This was a nice spacious place for larger groups.

Mostly we used Jordan station to go to places but both walks to Austin and Jordan stations are a little too far (for us). One of the bathrooms is super small and the entire room gets wet after a shower. Very very very close to Dimdimsum dimsum restaurant (Really good). The best part is the living room where everyone can sit and chill together after an adventurous day (not included in other places at this price). Also, they let us leave our bagges after our check-out at their office which is very appreciated for us as we still have another day-trip before going back home. Other than mentioned, nothing seems to be a problem.

In fact after agreeing with him for the charge of a taxi pick-up, he did not bother to inform me that the taxi was cancelled. \r\n\r\nOn reaching the apartment, we were shocked to see the amount of dirt, filth and the stench in the entire apartment originating from the bathrooms and kitchen. \r\n\r\nThe lady sent to welcome  us did not speak a word of English. So we could not communicate to her that the apartment needed to be cleaned.\r\n\r\nIn fact the stench was so unbearable that we had to clean the bathrooms and kitchen ourselves. He did send someone to check after a few hours and she too confirmed the extent of filth and odour in the apartment.\r\n\r\nThe listing too is inaccurate. Dan lists a washing machine and dryer. However there was no clothes dryer. There was a hair dryer though!!!\r\n\r\nThe 2nd bathroom (attached to a bedroom) has a water logging issue.

Checking in and out was very smooth.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of nice eateries downstairs and we had supper at different eateries every night before going home. There is a 7-11 as well. \r\n\r\nLocation wise, the place is perfect, about 10 min to Austin and 15min to Kowloon, Jordan and Yau Ma Tei for us (we have 2 very young kids so walking can be a little slow). \r\n\r\nPlace wise... the house is big, for Hong Kong standard. We like the living room where the kids could play and the adults could gather for a talk. The double beds are slightly smaller than queen size. The kitchen seems quite well equipped but we didn't use anything else other than the kettle for boiling water. There is a washing machine but no washing powder. The bigger bathroom works fine but the smaller one (really small) does not drain so well but we really appreciate having 2 bathrooms so we need not have to wait so long for a shower etc. Cleanliness can be improved though. \r\n\r\nAll in all, I will still recommend this place for bigger groups of 7 to 9 pax who are not too particular about cleanliness and older furniture. It's great value for its excellent location, convenience and space. \r\n\r\nThank you for hosting us.\r\n"},{"_id":"57125335","date":{"$date":"2015-12-22T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7369437","reviewer_id":"46926133","reviewer_name":"Yusuke","comments":"とても楽しく過ごせました｡連絡をすぐにいただけるのがとてもありがたく､安心しました｡大人数で行ったので､みんなが一緒に泊まれる､近所にｺﾝﾋﾞﾆやﾚｽﾄﾗﾝも多く､便利でした!"},{"_id":"59286170","date":{"$date":"2016-01-09T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7369437","reviewer_id":"48062833","reviewer_name":"Arty","comments":"Nice place in a nice location, very close to 2 subway stations.

They are really easy to talk and have transactions with. Very accommodating people. Location's good, few minutes walk to Austin and Jordan station. Below the home is a 711 and so many restaurants that are opened 24 hours. Accessible to temple night market if you want to go shopping. Really safe area.\n\nThe house is great, we were 10 adults with 2 kids. Just needs improvement with the room in the middle (with the 2nd bathroom) as it floods and you need to mop all the water off. Good thing they have a sponge mop ready but it would be better if they fix the bathroom to avoid inconvenience. Also the hose of the shower leaks, so it kinda adds to the flood. But can be improved :)\n\nThey have refrigerator, every room has an ac, wifi is really fast, water kettle and also microwave, electric stove and washing machine. They also have extra matress so if some of you wants to sleep outside in the living room, it's still cold and comfortable. So really convenient. Just maybe they can add English channels for foreigners ;)\n\nOverall, I'd recommend Dan and Eddy's place to my friends who would be planning to stay in HK. This is recommended for big groups. :) 5 stars!

It was good to have these things (like door codes) on hand at any moment. \r\nThe apartment itself was minimal, smallish, and clean. The building seemed nice, and the neighborhood had plenty of things in the area to see and shop at, especially with regards to food/coffee/groceries. \r\nBiggest pluses: the room was private and sparse, even if on the small side. We stayed in Room 01, which we learned was the smallest choice (it was a first come first served style, with three or four rooms available). The apartment was cleaned virtually every day. It was quiet indoors, and we were almost never bothered by anyone else. There were two shared bathrooms, which was nice when needed.\r\nBiggest cons: The room is at ground level, and everyone walking by can be heard up and down the street. The room was SMALL but the other three rooms looked to be about twice the size (so choose them!). The living room space had a tiny couch and no chairs, so it wasn't really comfortable. The two bathrooms seemed less generous when there were six people in the apartment all at once. \r\nThe toilets were specifically marked to not have ANY paper waste be deposited into them, which was annoying and gross. We were asked not to flush things like tampons and pads (a reasonable request) but also to throw out used toilet paper in the trash (which was not so great).\r\n\r\nOverall, it was a nice place with a weird rule or two. Choose the bigger room, and you probably won't meet anyone else staying there."},{"_id":"62520172","date":{"$date":"2016-02-15T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7382564","reviewer_id":"53151880","reviewer_name":"Abi","comments":"My stay was absolutely amazing!

There were also two bathrooms so there was never a long wait for the bathroom (although I did have to wait a few times). \r\n\r\nRay has a professional cleaning lady to clean the rooms before any guest stays and you will be provided with towels as well. I couple critiques I have is that the toilet paper in the bathroom could be better quality, and there should be hand towels and washcloths in addition to bath towels for guests. \r\n\r\nThe apartment is on the upper west side so it takes about 30 minutes via MTA to get to Rockefeller center and closer to 45 to get to lower Manhattan.

We didn't get back until late at night, so we took the one available room. Somehow, we either couldn't figure out how to turn the electricity on in that room (the rest of the apartment was fine) or it just wasn't working.

Something was up with the doorknob so we had difficulty getting in, luckily other renters were leaving so we were able to get in. The space is clean enough and I actually appreciate all the sticky note instructions because it makes things easier. Upon entry we smelled gas and realized someone had left the stove on so we turned it off. The bathroom was reasonably clean. The bedroom was very clean and he had a power strip so you can charge multiple things. You are meant to write your names and how long you'll be there on a sticky and put it on your door, but there were no working pens so we weren't able to do that. The next morning we woke up to cheese all over the kitchen counter and floor that my friend stepped in so that wasn't ideal. I guess the other renters were hungry in the middle of the night. Other than that our stay was great and I would definitely recommend staying in one of his apartments.

Washing machine is out of order. All the old guest have left their food in the fridge but none knows because none cares. \nWhen we arrived TV was out of order but Ray can't know it as he doesn't come to his own place.\n\nThen wifi and internet went to be out of order. Ray was called but didn't do anything until I called and said that I was there to work... No any commercial gesture for inconvenience.\nHe finally said that he has another apartment to rent in the 5th floor and sent us there to get wifi.\n\nOnly one room of the 4 in the apartment has a table to work. This the one on the picture.\n\nOne of the room had a door handle was broken which was not fixed...\n\nI have pictures of all what I wrote... If necessary.\n\nThe spirit of Airbnb is to share with the owner or we can choose and hotel.  If you want to do a business hotel ... Have a real reception desk with real commodities...\n\nYou said that parking was easy, I spent 2 hours on arrival to find a park spot.\n\nPlease explain what the signs means to foreigners...

There was initially a mixup on Ray's end, and he sent us to the wrong apartment (he has two in the same area). I understand how this sometimes happens, but it was late when we arrived and the mixup caused a delay when we were already very tired, which is why I'm taking one star off an otherwise 4-star experience. \r\nRay's place otherwise suited our need for a clean place to crash after a long day. It is conveniently located (15 min walk) from Columbia university, and the check-in/check-out process is easy. If you are a stickler for extreme cleanliness, I would not recommend it for you, but otherwise, it's a good place for people who will spend most of their day out of the house.

This place is basically a four bedroom hostel. While I was there for two days many people came through. It's very basic and cluttered. The owner does not live here. It is also a thirty dollar Uber to downtown where most things I wanted to do were. One of the two showers was broken while I was there so the first morning I waited for two hours before I could get in the shower and leave. The second day I got up early and they had fixed the other shower. The advertised washer and dryer was broken and looked as though it had been for a long time. This is an Airbnb farm and for the money you can find much better in this area or, in my opinion, a better area."},{"_id":"186432106","date":{"$date":"2017-08-24T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7382564","reviewer_id":"15443145","reviewer_name":"Courtney","comments":"It was very reasonable for NYC.

Aside from being in a good location, there were many things misleading about this listing.\nFirst off, there is NO free parking on the premises. He is referring to the street parking outside his apartment. You do not learn about that until after you book and it is too late.\nSecondly, the instructions the host sent us after booking were very long, poorly articulated, and left us with the impression that he wasn't suppose to be renting his place out as an airBnB. Getting in was like trying to get into an escape room. Many combinations and locks AND the door to the apartment was very janky and taped together.\nAdditionally, the space is not as nice as it appears in the pictures. The common space is messy, very dark, and NOT air conditioned. Not comfortable to be in. The room we booked was astonishingly smaller than the pictures. The only thing that I will say is the bathrooms are very nice and the only redeeming quality.\nLast of all, the space is shared by many people, not including the host (which we never even saw by the way). There were at least three other people in the apartment in addition to my boyfriend and I. This became problematic in the morning when trying to get ready on a time crunch, even with the two beautiful bathrooms. It was quite frustrating.\nOverall, I wish I read the reviews before booking this listing because I would have absolutely looked elsewhere. Because of the \"free parking\" LIE we had to pay $90 for a parking garage space which threw off my budget for my entire trip. Know what you're getting into if you book this listing."},{"_id":"296353152","date":{"$date":"2018-07-25T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7382564","reviewer_id":"115675180","reviewer_name":"Marc-Antoine","comments":"Very close to metro.

Unfortunately we only met once for a short moment. But I could reach her easily via airbnb and mobile. Check in worked perfectly out as her friend was waiting for us at night. \n\nThe place is a really nice old house in a pretty quiet neighbourhood, north of the city center. You can walk there in round about 45 minutes or take the public transport. Option 1: bus to trinidade and then metro. Option 2: go directly by metro. Bus is ca. 2-3 min. from the house, metro ca. 15 min. Closeby are some supermarkets as well as a restaurant over the street. But you can aso use the kitchen, living and dining room what we did a few times for breakfast. \n\nThe room we booked (suite) comes with a double bed, closet, commode, chair and its own bathroom. The room and bathroom themselves are relatively big. As the furniture is pretty old I didn´t like the smell and beside that the drawers had been dirty, so for me it was definitely too less space to put my stuff somewhere else - same in the bathroom. The door to the bathroom is hard to close/open which starts to get on the nerves anywhen. If you turn on the light a really noisy deduction starts working. \nI was traveling with my brother - so the bed was toooo small for the 2 of us. No idea which size it had - maybe 1.20m? Additionally the mattress is really uncomfortable, you can already feel the springs, and the bed makes a noise always when you are moving. I am sorry to say but I can´t recommend staying in that room (which is BTW the most expensive one of all 3 rooms Oriana offers).\n\nAfter 3 nights we had the option to move in another room with 2 seperate beds (which is 5€ cheaper a night). The switch was the best decision ever as we had the first night we slept well over there. The  room has enough space for 2 people and also enough options to store your stuff somewhere. The only difference - it has no own bathroom and there is only a tiny window to let some light inside. As is it closer to the street also a bit louder if you prefer sleeping with an opened window.\n\nIn total I would not come back to Orianas house. For me it is too far away from the city center. Then I would prefer paying a bit more instead of loosing time in moving up and down and paying for public transport. I am also a bit disappointed about the room we first booked and also that Oriana didn´t offer to pay back some money after room changing (as the one was cheaper)."},{"_id":"210434242","date":{"$date":"2017-11-09T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7382567","reviewer_id":"27238078","reviewer_name":"Anne","comments":"Oriana's place was very stylish and she was very nice to let me check in earlier than her normal check in time.

My wife and I are vegan, which tends to narrows down the restaurant options even more, haha, but that was not a problem at all. *(small review of a really good restaurant close to her place at the bottom of this review). \n\nHer place is a pretty cool but we didn't explore the amenities that much because we were out and about all the time during our stay.

We were there in winter so yes, the house was cold, but in the room it was ok with the heaters. The bathroom was clean. It can be a little bit noisy into the house (kitchen, step on floor)  but the guest were nice and gently. We saw Oriana once, at our arrival and she was very nice.

This might be a norm in the tropical island.\n-The property is adjacent to a very busy freeway and so the garden has a constant traffic noise. The house windows do an excellent job of blocking the noise though so we did not hear anything while indoors.\n- There is only one AC in the living room and it takes about 3-4 hours for the bedrooms to cool down in April.\n- The garden and the home looks like it needed a bit of tending, though with the fertile land and weather, things probably grow and weather very quickly here."},{"_id":"150885704","date":{"$date":"2017-05-09T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7388842","reviewer_id":"117209209","reviewer_name":"Charlotte","comments":"The house was clean and comfortable with a lovely backyard complete with grill, hammock, table, and even an outdoor sofa.

I wished I could take them home with me. The condo is very convenient for the more northern beaches that are less populated, yet were gorgeous. We thoroughly enjoyed snorkeling at Hapuna state park (fabulous beach), the Black sand beach.  We liked the bungalo because it is removed from the big city tourist stuff, and not as uppity as the resorts; yet the drive isn't too bad to get to the Kona beach stuff either, such as a Luau and boat diving trips; but be aware of major delays near the airport until they finish the road construction, so add a half hour to your travel plans that go southward until the road work is finished. The other route across the Island or via Hilo might be best to get to the volcano park for now.

It has a very different from atmosphere from a resort, or central tourist areas. It's old Hawaii. Nearby beaches are top notch, snorkeling is fab, you can eat on a patio under the stars, and  the fact that the house is not far from a freeway and a part of a village just adds charm and a sense of realness.  The selection of places in Rachel's guide is right on, kitchen has everything needed to cook (not groceries, I mean amenities), boogies, beach chairs, beach mats, towels, etc. - all clean and ready.

If you have a car, then this is a fabulous place to stay for relaxing days at the beach. Spencer Beach is just down the hill-5 minute drive. Hapuna Beach is a little further-maybe 15 minutes-but so worth it-one of the nicest beaches we have ever been to. Make sure you do your grocery shopping on the way, either in Waimea if coming from that direction, or Kailua-Kona, because there is nothing nearby. The listing is clear that there is car and truck noise from the road. This is true. But it is the only noise. Otherwise it is very quiet and peaceful. There is less traffic after 9:30pm and it only starts again around 5am. We slept with the windows open for a breeze and I closed them and turned on the a/c when the traffic started at dawn. The a/c really mutes the noise. I am a very light sleeper and I slept fine. The garden is quite big, the kids had fun playing in it. There is a hose out back to rinse off feet and beach stuff. The decor is pretty, it has a very hawaiian beach vibe. The beds are very comfortable, we slept very well. The shower has good water pressure. We recommend this place, just don't expect to eat out in restaurants or pick something up. Be prepared and you will have a relaxing time."},{"_id":"240926310","date":{"$date":"2018-03-06T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7388842","reviewer_id":"61397584","reviewer_name":"Mikaela","comments":"Rachel's place was great and she was very responsive and accommodating.

From the kitchen to the bathroom and bedroom, my partner and I have nothing bad to say about this place or the location. The location was absolutely fantastic and quiet. \nThe condo was very clean and exactly as pictured. Washer and dryer in the apartment made laundry super convenient. Parking is located within the building as well for a fee. We had a great view from the corner apartment. Beautiful expansive windows. Neighbors were very quiet. Building itself was well kept and is a 5 min walk from the metro station, lots of great restaurants and bars and Notre-Dame Basilica. \n\nBe aware that most of OLD DOWNTOWN does close early. But it's defiantly not as busy and touristy as DOWNTOWN, which was a huge plus for my partner and I. \n\nWe definitely look forward to staying here again.

A gorgeous spot tucked away in what is locally notorious for being one of the most beautiful jungled areas on island. The great Hosts, Julia and Harry, are very carefully developing the site for a few fortunate travelers to be able to experience Hawaiian living at its simple best. \r\nThe 'Sunrise Room' is one of the sweetest places I've ever stayed in - clean and comfy and cute. In fact, the small colorful and creative touches built into this room, into the large open-air kitchen, and found around the rest of the grounds and facilities, make the whole place feel fun and delightful throughout. In my view the pictures don't even do it justice. There is a sense of complete remoteness here that is soothing to be in as well - a 'far off the beaten track' feel. And yet, it is really only 10 or 12 minutes away from everything -- swimming at the coast or a meal in town.

The kitchen building is also open air and larger, and we had it to ourselves on our stay.  WiFi was excellent and the outdoor shower was nice.

Upon arrival, the communication was very poor.  \r\n\r\nI was confused with, 1. Retrieving the condo key from the confusing lockbox versus mailbox and 2. The parking situation.  I called Jane and she was unfriendly and screaming on the phone that she had already sent me directions and to follow the directions.  Since I was offered 2 parking options.  One to park in the hotel garage, which is much more convenient, for 25.00 cash per day, or park with her garage for 12.00 per day which was offsite.  Although I was on a budget and been flying all day, I chose to park at the hotel parking garage which charged 25.00 cash only per day.  The other garage was offsite and not convenient at all.  \r\n\r\nI told Jane while I had her on the phone,  I didn't like how this was all set up and let her know that we had started off on the wrong foot.  I didn't speak to her the rest of my visit, only spoke to her by text as she requested.  \r\n\r\nI like the view of the place.  It was nice.  With no window screens, this could be dangerous or huge liability for a family travelling with kids and wanting to open the window 38 floors up.  I would say the place was not very clean upon arrival.  Sand in my floor room along with hair in the bathroom.  The second bedroom, B unit, should have a television.  Also, having cable would be a good addition instead of Roku TV only.  The wi-fi worked well in the room.

The windows can be opened wide to allow better viewing or rapid airing of the rooms, but keep an eye on your young ones. Traffic noise is generally OK, although emergency services frequent the nearby access streets for Waikiki. Sirens are not so noticeable with the windows shut, so air-conditioning  was appreciated in both rooms for sleeping. There was also a tower fan unit, which worked well.\r\nBedding was adequate and comfortable, including a top bunk over a double, which is suited to the small and nimble (and someone who doesn't move around much in their sleep).\r\nThe wi-fi internet access worked well.\r\nLift access is efficient.\r\nWe used the pool a couple times and found it clean enough.\r\nOverall, we enjoyed our stay.

Buy a blow up mattress and inflate it at any ABC store for a relaxing way to spend a day at the beach. Last tip, if you're an adult, hire a moped and go exploring! \nJane's accommodation is a perfect base for the best of Waikiki offerings.

Not super close yet not bad. Location itself is not a deal breaker. Kitchen: You do have a small stove and sinks to cook, knifes, cups, plates and a fridge. Also there is beach mats in the closet for you to use. Parking: Parking is expensive in Waikiki ($25-30) a day so Jane did offer parking off site for a bargain of $12 a day. Jane was great with communication too. We didn't meet her at all as she gave us instructions on how to arrive and open the lockbox ourselves to get the keys an check in. We basically checked in and out ourselves by leaving the location keys back in the loop lockbox after we left. She also let us check in earlier which was nice too. The Bad: It's a VERY old apartment. Definitely NOT in a \"newly remodeled\" state. Not even close! Quite the contrary! Worst of all although: It's dirty and UNSANITARY :-( The whole apartment is in bad shape. Bed linens and comforters all seemed unwashed and had stains. They also smelled VERY funky. We were grossed out and were afraid of sleeping in them. Also all of the bathroom towels smelled so DIRTY and HUMID! They had obviously not been previously washed for us to use. We didn't bring our own towels so using dirty towels was so gross. We had to suck it up. This had never happened to us before and we have stayed in many Airbnb's over the years. The bathroom was full of mold and old; tiles were squishy and even falling apart ( one fell off to the back wall) The shower seems to have bad water damage. The old rusty shower hose even came off at one point and I had to screw it back on. It was soooo rusty and hard that it made it very hard to pull to turn the shower water on. The shower curtain was also soooo old and moldy. Chunks o \"goo\" and old plastic particles were coming off from it as we showered. Yuck yuck! We also didn't need to use the stove kitchen but we were so glad that we didn't have to because the cups and tea kettle smelled bad and the stove was greasy and was not properly cleaned. Only the fridge was clean inside. The apartment is also a 1 bedroom apartment with 2 bathrooms. One is an actual bedroom with a sink and a bathroom and the other larger room is actually the kitchen and living room that other covered into \"a room\" by just adding 2 extra beds right in the kitchen and calling it a bedroom. So between the \" newly renovated \" listing description and the actual room setting, it was a bit deceiving this listing. Also the elevator takes forever but that was the least of our dislikes with this..."},{"_id":"140789519","date":{"$date":"2017-03-31T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7405576","reviewer_id":"112735367","reviewer_name":"Trista","comments":"Jane is a lovely host, but we had a couple unfortunate events while staying at the apartment. The door lock broke down, and so our key cards stopped working and we had to spend a sweaty hour hanging out in the hall and going back and forth to the security desk to sort it out - not the end of the world, but certainly annoying. Also, we were told we could have cheaper parking next door which came together too late and we ended up paying the very expensive full rate - again, not the end of the world, just annoying. The apartment is very central and walking distance to a few great places to eat, but is super small - really just a place to sleep. If that's all you need, then, great. But if you are travelling with kids and need a place to hang out during the day, it is too cramped for that.

The condo is near the Ala Wai canal on the edge of Wakiki, but It's a reasonable 15-min walk to beach/shopping/eating at Ala Moana in one direction or Wakiki beachfront and shopping/eating on the other. The bus to Diamond Head and Hanauma Bay stops nearby. There's a Seven-Eleven next door. The condo is not fancy, but works well for families. The  master suite has its own bath and provides some privacy; the kitchen, dining table, bunk beds and double bed are all in one room, but that wasn't a problem with teenagers who slept like the dead while I was in the kitchen --and they had a separate bath.  The pool was a great amenity and got a lot of use from the boys. The closet was full of beach gear, including multiple sets of snorkeling equipment.

Cons: The hallway leading to the apartment had a strong odor, which cleared out of the apartment itself after we opened the windows for a few hours. The corridors in the apartment are a little cramped, so be aware if you have accessibility issues. The bathrooms are pretty lived in, with rust stains in the sink and tub. The AC units are also a bit noisy, so I had to turn one off to sleep. The unit that is the kitchen needs more light around the dining table/bunk beds. Pros: Super conveniently located to convenience stores, the beach near the Hilton Village (which I preferred to the \"main\" Waikiki beach), restaurants. The condo has two full bathrooms that are stocked with necessities. The kitchen is also stocked with utensils and appliances. \n\nAll in all, if I had read the description more carefully, I would have noticed this condo is actually located in the Hawaiian Monarch hotel and wouldn't have booked it.

The beds were quite hard in our room but we liked it. The bathroom was clean and a shared toilet/shower but that's also not a biggie.

You will encounter many travelers and it leaves you with a safe feeling - lots of CCTV add to it. \n\nThe room is small but has everything you need. If you stay longer and have a lot of luggage, you might end up missing a closet. Otherwise it's nice. Fresh bedsheets, towels and shower gel/shampoo and toothbrushes are provided. \nThe best way to find it is to look for a little street vendor that is literally right in front of the entrance to the building on Nathan Road. \n\nWe would always stay with Albert again and can recommend the place.

The closest grocery store is about a 10-15 minute walk away. The underground parking was very convenient.

","neighborhood_overview":"Maroubra is roughly 10km from the centre of Sydney, in the Eastern Suburbs. We have lived in the area for around 6 years, and we absolutely love it! It has a great community atmosphere and it's hard to walk down the street to the beach without running into people we know. We know and love lots of the cafe and restaurant owners in the area, and have made friends with lots of the neighbours.  The beach is the highlight of the area, and it's right across the street! Maroubra beach is 1km long and is popular for surfing, swimming, a BBQ, a nice spot to sit and have lunch/dinner or just a walk to get some fresh air, space and relax. It's less crowded than its neighbour up in Bondi, but no less beautiful. To the south end there is a reserve with no buildings or houses, so it's particularly beautiful looking down the sand and waves to the trees and headland. Maroubra has plenty of cafes and there are several great options for a morning coffee or brunch/lunch. If you breakfast at Marini and en","notes":"- Our apartment is on the ground floor, so there are no stairs to climb - Free car parking on the street  - Column heaters available to use if it gets cold - Toys and books suitable for kids - Private rear access to apartment.","transit":"Transport is very accessible.

There are plenty of benches near the beach across the street that you can use. Just make sure you put any rubbish in the bin, to keep Maroubra beautiful! • NO parties - we live in a quiet,  small building and our neighbours treat us with great respect. We do the same for them, and so would expect you to do the same by keeping noise to a minimum at night. Within reason, you're welcome to have friends/family over, however absolutely no parties.

When we arrived and saw it, it exceeded our expectations indeed. For those that are traveling with kids, the kids room in this apartment is any child's dream wonderland which made settling our little girl in all that much easier. The location of the beach (just across the road) made it all the more fun. \r\n\r\nFor a small apartment, I was very impressed with how Nathan has maximised the space. The apartment has obviously been updated with quality appliances. It was my first time using an induction stove top - it was most impressive. The heated master bed was also a great luxury.\r\n\r\nFinally, it was all the little extras that Nathan provided that made it a memorable experience. We got a large box of chocolates, quality soap and well known brand name (eco and organic) hand wash and cleaning products.\r\n\r\nNathan kept in contact throughout the week and even recommended local places for us to check out which was very helpful for us.

My husband and I are visiting Australia from the U.S., so after our 15 hour flight, Nathan so graciously offered us an earlier check-in time to freshen up and relax. Unfortunately, we didn't get to use the early check-in because 3 hours into our arrival in Sydney, we had an accident with a roundabout and a curb. Nathan was so thoughtful and checked in on us until we received a new rental car, and he was nice enough to leave us keys for when we arrived.  Nathan's home is beautiful and very comfortable. The bed was completely cozy and we slept well during our stay. The home is literally across the street from Maroubra  beach and you can enjoy the soft sand there while watching the surfers. It is also about a 0.5 mile beautiful scenic walk to Mahon Pool and an amazing cafe called Pool Cafe that has the best coffee and breakfast/lunch to start your mornings/days. At night we could walk to any of the restaurants and bars and felt very safe, and the locals were so friendly.

The bathrooms are great as there is a toilet on the first floor and an additional toilet with shower on the second floor next to the master bedroom. Also this room is very nice, I was very surprised and happy when I saw that beautiful room. But above everything else I loved the terrace which really provides enough space. It was so wonderful to enjoy breakfast in the morning there. Nice and typical shops around the apartment made it easy to get everything for preparing meals and also many restaurants around make it easy if you didn't want to be far away from your apartment in the night after a bustling day in the city. Although the surrounding of Aksaray is not what everyone wishes as it is well known to be a conservative place and also a meltingpot for certain illegals. Although I want to mention that I always at every time of the day and in the night felt very safe in this area where I stayed with my 13 years old son, that the apartment is on a good location, that I felt like being a part of Istanbul and not just a tourist, getting a bit of the feeling of a real life in that wonderful city and I would love to stay there again."},{"_id":"4565790","date":{"$date":"2013-05-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"744242","reviewer_id":"599869","reviewer_name":"Paul","comments":"Great apartment within walking distance of all the main attractions.

A small market is open 24hours and other small Turkish and Kurdish restaurants are all around. \r\n\r\nWe did not meet Onur in person, but he has been very responsive when we had questions (such as how to operate a machine where everything is written in Turkish). \r\n\r\nBear in mind that the flat is on the 4th floor with no lift (especially if you are traveling with heavy luggage) and that there is a steep, uneven-stepped interior staircase leading to shower, main bedroom and terrace. There is one tiny one-bed bedroom downstairs, and a master's bedroom upstairs where the shower+toilet+sink is also located. One additional toilet+ sink downstairs. Decoration was not our favorite but all is clean and probably quite new, so this only an opinion, a matter of taste..

Definitely have a map and walking directions with you, and be sure to search for the Askaray METRO stop - there is also a nearby Aksaray TRAM stop, which is not the same! We did not meet Ibrahim, but were met outside and let into the apartment by his father who was very kind and helpful. The apartment was beautiful and clean, exactly as pictured in the photos and provided more than enough space for our three person group. The apartment also included two air conditioners, which cooled the apartment quickly and were great to come home to after a long, hot Istanbul summer day. The highlight of this place was definitely the lovely terrace. It was a perfect place to relax and overlook the city. The only real drawback about the apartment was its location - while the main sights of the old city were reachable by foot (25 minutes to Sultanahmet square) and by tram (5-10 minutes to Sultanahmet), the tram does not run all night and this made returning to the apartment after a long night out somewhat difficult. But the walk is easy, and passes right by the Grand Bazaar! Would recommend this apartment for guests who do not mind a little exercise (it is on the top floor, and you will be doing a fair bit of walking if you would like to skip the tram) and for whom outdoor space is a priority - I will repeat, the terrace really was spectacular.

The train line is about a 5-10 minute walk from the apartment which was nice.\r\n\r\nIf we go back to Istanbul we would stay at Ibrahim's again."},{"_id":"23211987","date":{"$date":"2014-11-25T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"744242","reviewer_id":"20889282","reviewer_name":"Xiang","comments":"My first try on Airbnb.

I travelled with my friends (5 of us) and we just loved the apartment!  It was clean, we had everything we needed in the apartment.  It was cold outside the day we arrived (which was actually early in the morning) and the apartment was so warm and cozy.  Ibrahim was an amazing host.  He met us early in the morning, showed us around the apartment and explained everything.  After that we had the apartment all to ourselves. \r\nThe apartment was exactly as described and exactly as you see in the pictures. It's a walk up apartment, you get a bit of exercise walking up and down, but it is worth every bit of it. The neighborhood is safe. \r\nEvery public transportation that exists in Istanbul is in a short walking distance from Ibrahim's place. The apartment is less than 3-min-walk from Aksaray subway (metro), which by the way takes you straight to Ataturk Airport :) SOOO convenient.  Tram is less than 5-min-walk from the apartment and plenty of bus stops around going to different directions.  \r\nIf you need grocery shopping, stores are in the neighborhood. \r\n\r\nWe've already recommended the apartment to others, and they already booked it.  Next time we are in Istanbul and in need of the apartment, definitely staying at Ibrahim's place. \r\nThank you very much for such an amazing experience.  This was not my first time using AirBNB, but it was for all my friends and they were amazed how great everything worked out :) \r\nIt was home away from home :) "},{"_id":"31568897","date":{"$date":"2015-05-07T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"744242","reviewer_id":"25676334","reviewer_name":"Eldar","comments":"Жили в этой квартире с 30 апреля по 6 мая.

В квартире нам всего хватило, все , что было в описании. Большой плюс - терасса - там мы и проводили то время, когда возвращались домой. Состояние квартиры среднее, но с учетом, что это центр старого города, близко все исторические места - одно другим компенсировалось. Ибрагим встретил, разместил и даже позволил на несколько часов задержаться при выезде.

Clean and well appointed, the apartment is a great size (for NYC) and I was surprised at how big it felt, the bed is super comfy and the pullout couch was very nice as well. The location couldn't have been any better for us, since we mostly roamed around in every direction without a real plan, we were literally in the middle of everywhere we wanted to go! Robert was great with opening the lines of communication and was there to greet us and show is where everything was located. Our departure was just as friendly and even though he had warned us that he would need the apartment right at checkout he was very nice about us being a few minutes late (bars close at 4am... Not good if you need to be up and out at 11!) \r\nThe street is beautiful to look at from the (tiny but perfect) balcony and the restaurant that's below is really really good (get the meatballs!!) overall it was an awesome first experience with airbnb and I will highly recommend this apartment and Robert to everyone who is willing to listen!

Apartment is clean, spacious, and in an awesome location. Lots of shops, restaurants, bars, coffee shops and juice bars within a short walking distance (2-3 minutes). It is also only a 10 minute walk from Broadway, which is the main shopping street that extends from Little Italy all the way up to Central Park. There is also a Whole Foods about 15 minutes away. Getting a cab from JKF airport is straightforward and there is a set tariff of $52 (plus tip usually 20%). Most of the cabs accept credit cards. \r\n\r\nThere are few a few places to visit on Mulberry Street  alone before you even walk across to Lafayette Street or Broadway. Tobys' bar and Pizza place has a great atmosphere (and pizza) or Spring Lounge (which is aways busy even on a Sunday). The nearest subway is off Spring Street about 5 minutes walk and that will take you all the way up to main shops on 5th and 6th Avenue. Lombardi's was the first pizza place in the US and is about 5-10 minutes walk. You can eat in or get takeaway and by far the best pizza I had in New York. If you want the healthy option there is a falafel and smoothie bar on Mulberry street, which is also great too. \r\n\r\nOne of my favourite places was the Fat Radish - visited it about 5 times in 3 weeks. It's about 15 minute walk or just jump in a cab but you will need to book a table if you want to eat in the restaurant. They do have a bar area where you can just turn up and wait. After you have finished head across the road to the Lead Belly - this is a bar owned by the same people. Great place to spend an evening.\r\n\r\nIf you head up to Spring street and then turn left you will join Lafayette Street where you will find many more places to eat, drink and shop.\r\n\r\nIf you are a coffee fan then head to Lafayette Street and walk past G-star and 2-3 shops down will be a little coffe shop called La Colombe, which is apparently one of the best in New York. I don't like to coffee so difficult for me to comment but it was highly recommended.\r\n\r\nIf you want to see any NBA or NFL whilst in NYC then use (Website hidden by Airbnb) to purchase your tickets. There are always games on and you will find great last minute deals on there. \r\n\r\n"},{"_id":"3816505","date":{"$date":"2013-03-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"746088","reviewer_id":"4852661","reviewer_name":"Gérard","comments":"We enjoyed our stay in this lovely apartement, perfectely located in the center of the city - walking distance to the best neighboroods!

Checking in and out was real smooth, no problems. The appartment is nice with a fully equipped kitchen, stayed there with a friend so one of us took the bedroom and the other one slept on the sofa bed which was just fine. The only thing I think needs improving are the curtains, you can´t really block out the sun in the morning, no big problem though. And maybe a lamp by the bed and one by the sofa if you like to read in bed. Over all it was a great stay and Robert seemed like a really nice and reliable guy.

Right in the heart of Little Italy and just a short stroll from the Canal Street subway station, I could not have asked for a better location. \r\nYou really have most of lower Manhattan within walking distance from the apartment. Shop 'till you drop in SOHO or if you like a good walk like me, head uptown to 5th. avenue which took me under an hour. Leave plenty of room in your suitcase!\r\nThe night that I arrived a street festival was in full swing and I will never forget the sweet aroma from the wood fired pizza ovens coming up from the street. The restaurants on Mulberry street are great and literally right at your door!\r\nThe apartment is very comfortable with a modern kitchen and bathroom, good security and WiFi. The balcony offers great views of Mulberry street and there is always something going on down below, especially on weekends.\r\nI love New York and if I am lucky enough to get back there one day, hopefully I will be able to stay here again. \r\nCheers,\r\nBen Prior. \r\nMelbourne, Australia.\r\n"},{"_id":"7915570","date":{"$date":"2013-10-08T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"746088","reviewer_id":"7668422","reviewer_name":"Ronnie","comments":"We arrived pretty late on a monday evening (around 9 pm). But that was no problem for Robert, and we got access to the apartment easy and smooth with no problem.\r\n\r\nThe location could not have been better! Little Italy itself is a great place for good food and a nice atmosphere. Also there is so much to see and do around there. China town, Soho, not far to walk to Brooklyn bridge, battery park etc. Tube stations really close aswell if you want to go uptown for instance. And it really gets quiet after 10 - 11 pm, since its a resturant street. Nice if you like us want an early night, to get up early in the morning.\r\n\r\nThe apartment itself was bigger then we expected. Nice bathroom, and a comfortable bed in the bedroom. Kitchen had all we needed and we have nothing bad to say about Robert or the apartment. It was great, and we are very happy we choose Robert as our host for our honeymoon. The apartment really helped make our week perfect!\r\n\r\nWe will most likley come back next time we are going to New york! (unless we REALLY REALLY wanna live closer to someplace else).\r\n\r\nAnother big plus was the elevator after a full day of walking and coming to the apartment with stuff we had bought.\r\n\r\nAnd when we were leaving we were leaving pretty late, but Robert helped us out so we could solve everything with luggage and such.

Robert has been also timely and helpful throughout. \r\nThere are a couple of things that need to be fixed/provided.

We loved people watching from the little balcony and Little Italy is a wonderful place to do that. \r\n\r\nThere are so many restaurants around that you are spoiled for choice.\r\n\r\nThe only negative is that we had no access to the laundry room. You needed a fob which we weren't given. I didn't bother getting in touch about it as I was travelling on elsewhere where I could wash my clothes. As I said, that was the only negative. I would certainly return and highly recommend this little gem.\r\n\r\n"},{"_id":"92947851","date":{"$date":"2016-08-10T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"746088","reviewer_id":"5156933","reviewer_name":"Rakis","comments":"We were met by Alan who showed us the place.

A casa é super completa, desde eletrodomésticos a produtos de limpeza, mas achei o armário que guarda roupas de cama e banho desorganizado, tudo numa pilha. A casa também tem muita coisa do morador, e minha esposa sentiu esses detalhes por causa da rinite alérgica. A casa fica numa rua com muitos restaurantes, mas não achei barulhenta.

It is spacious, cozy and comfortable, kitchen has everything you need, nice crumbled stone tile in the bathroom, comfortable bed, gorgeous bedding, great lighting, just really nice.  The area is so chock full of restaurants that it can be difficult to find the little convenience store or wine shop you might need, so I would suggest doing a little exploring early in your stay, heading north rather than south (you will find them within 3 or 4 block).  It was not nearly as noisy as I expected the neighborhood to be, except for one night when a jack hammer started happening at midnight, which is not allowed by city ordinance, but could (and does) happen anywhere in the city.  If I wasn't on the verge of falling asleep, I would have gone out and yelled at whoever was doing it and called 311.   The lobby as you walk in has some wear and tear, but you will forget about it as soon as you walk in to the apartment and see to the beautiful wood floors.  Great place and I'll stay there again.

I also told him that I didn’t find the dining table mentioned in his description. The day after we found the 2 tables upon returning to the apartment, which was very kind of him. . \nAnd I thanked him for that. \nI decided then to overlook the dirtiness of the sitting room window, the broken basin in the bathroom, the impossibility to store our own toilet bags since the underneath cupboard was full of his stuff, the fact that we had to push his own clothes in the bedroom closet in order to put ours, the impossibility to store our food in your kitchen cupboards as they were already full……\nBut there is something I cannot overlook. It is the shock I had when I removed the bed sheets and discovered the state of his mattress. Studded with stains, probably urine stains. And the sheets were directly in contact with the mattress. Not even a mattress cover. If I had discovered that upon our arrival I would have rushed to the nearest hotel. It is a matter of hygiene and this is not acceptable. \nSame thing with the pillows. The pillow cases directly in contact with spotted pillows. No pillow cover. \nI took pictures to illustrate this sorry situation. . \nRobert seems to be running a real business out of his flat and that should make him responsible. The fact that he ignores the minimum hygiene rules is my business. A clean apartment is the most essential part of the Airbnb experience. \nThis is not acceptable. I am not asking for any refund of all sorts. One thing is sure I don’t feel like visiting this place again.

It really is the perfect location, especially for someone visiting the city for the first time.  There are literally dozens of restaurants within a couple of blocks from the apartment, and the bars, shops and restaurants in Soho, Nolita, the Lower East Side, and Chinatown are an easy walk. Despite the super central location, the street gets quiet at night once the restaurants close up. The apartment itself is clean and big for the city -- way bigger than a hotel room at the same price point -- so was comfortable for 3 people. Robert is a great host as well, taking the time to meet us in person and answer questions.

Grocery stores, bars, restaurants: everything you need is right on the doorstep.\nWe were there during the blizzard and Rob was really accommodating, letting us stay a bit longer in the apartment as the airports were closed on the day we were meant to leave.\nAll in all, a great host, a great apartment and we hope to return!"},{"_id":"225229472","date":{"$date":"2018-01-05T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"746088","reviewer_id":"9452365","reviewer_name":"Kenzen","comments":"NYC snowstorm made impossible for me to fly to the city, so I had to cancel my reservation.

Most one bedroom apartments in Manhattan are tiny. This is a \"true\" one bedroom. The bedroom is big enough to put your suitcases near the bed. The kitchen is full size, and runs into a full size living room. The apartment was very clean, with tons of towels and a well-equipped kitchen, TV with lots of channels, great living room couch, and the owner sent a wonderful rep to check us in, Allan, who was patient and gave us great restaurant recommendations.  This is beyond central--right on Mulberry Street 1.5 blocks from Canal. If you come into Grand Central, the 6 train leaves you only a 5 minute walk from the apartment. The area is a great one for walking around, and the nearby streets tend to be a bit less busy with cars. As to people, it was just Saturday that Little Italy and Mulberry St. got busy, but once you stepped off into a side street, no. Regarding noise, well, you are in the city. We stayed Thurs to Sun, and only Friday night did we pick up any late night noise. We recommend you looking around for restaurants, the ones right on Mulberry are friendly but they are the pricey tourist places and you can often find a place that's more interesting. Robert's place is highly recommended!!"},{"_id":"343705574","date":{"$date":"2018-11-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"746088","reviewer_id":"167350129","reviewer_name":"Joy","comments":"Loved the apartment.

If you turn on the tap, it automatically turns on the gas, but it is important to leave the window in the bathroom ALWAYS open for safety reasons, even when you leave the apartment. This is a rule of the gas company. 2 – There is an air conditioner in the bed room, it is very important that you turn off the air conditioner when you leave the apartment in order for it not to break. If the air conditioning breaks, it can take long to fix and you will ended up staying without cold temperature in the room. As soon as you turn it on, it will refrigerate the room very fast.

It's one block from the beach, the grocery store, a taxi stand, and many many restaurants and stores. The area felt safe, even walking around at night. Obviously, we used caution, but it felt safer and more populated than some other neighborhoods we visited. Doorman always there and always friendly. \r\n\r\nCheck in and out were simple. Silvia was helpful via text, and her associate lives in the building and was always accessible for questions (in person or via phone). \r\n\r\nThe apartment looks just like the pictures. We were worried that there weren't windows, but there are! Everything worked nicely and it was very, very clean. There is a door that separates the bedroom and the living room, which was great because then we could both have our own private space. We stayed for 12 days, so this was helpful. \r\n\r\nOne tip is to bring adaptors for plugs. We bought them easily at a nearby bookstore, but the plugs are 2 prong, Brazilian style, so our American electronics needed adaptors.

If you like to go to bed before 1030, you will need earplugs, as a live band will be playing across the street....not a problem for me.  Two supermarkets are within 2 blocks, the hot water is hot, and the WiFi is OK most days.  I had two periods of approximately 18 hours (in one month) where it slowed to almost unusable.  I'm sure it wasn't related to Silvia, but rather the provider or maintenance.  Otherwise, I could stream movies, sports and music just fine.  My girlfriend and I were there for NYE and it is in the center of that as well.  I've been traveling nonstop for 5 months and staying in Air BnB the entire time.

Erik could not have made my experience any more enjoyable. New to airbnb and my first time in NYC as a solo traveller I was not entirely sure what to expect.\r\nFirstly the apartment is in the best location, so central, on 7th Avenue close to fabulous restaurants, bars, cafes, clubs, shops and subway. Then short walk to the Highline, Chelsea Market, Meatpacking district, Flatiron district, Greenwich Village, or a short subway ride to Uptown, Midtown, Brooklyn, Lower Manhatten. Secondly the light filled apartment was big enough (given the little time I spent there), very clean and tidy, but homely and (Website hidden by Airbnb) bed was a fold out couch which was really comfortable, my room faced on to the street and though the window was double glazed at times it could be noisey but never a problem. My room was also very private and I felt very safe. The small but functional bathroom that was spotless with plenty of hot water and light.\r\nThirdly Erik was great, never intrusive but friendly and helpful. Always contactable, great with local information and tips, umbrella when it rained, WiFi,and was incredibly generous when on the day of departure things did not go to plan so Erik generously allowed me to stay an extra night!  Lastly was Augie, Erik's adorable little dog.

Realmente estamos muy agradecidos. Con respecto al hermoso departamento, se encuentra ubicado en Chelsea y es tal como se muestra en las imagenes. Todo super moderno y con todos los accesorios para sentirse cómodo. La habitación súper fresca y agradable como para descansar luego de un largo dia de caminatas y paseos. Luminoso y bien distribuido. Solo tener en cuenta (para la gente mayor) que se debe subir algunos pisos por escalera. Con respecto al barrio, muy divertido y agradable, muchisimas opciones para hacer por la noche, para comprar distintos tipos de comida. Lo mas importante, muy cerca de las estaciones de subte o incluso para llegar caminando a cualquier hora. Realmente Súper recomendable.

Erik has great taste and the place looks even better then on the pictures. The location is the best you can probably get in Chelsea and Erik is a super host! He gives you the privacy you need but is always there and up for a chat. He's also always super helpful with anything you have, restaurant advice, what to do, where to go and he always helped me out with tons of other things that occurred during my stay. I stayed one month with Erik during a training I did in the city and he was a big part why my stay was so great!

The bedroom has a private entry, with wardrobe space and air conditioning. Noise levels were quite good, the bedroom does not back onto a street so mostly distant city noises.\n\nThe neighbourhood is very safe, with great options for local dining and bars. It is situated near numerous subway lines, making it convenient to travel within Manhattan, Brooklyn or beyond.\n\nErik was a wonderful host, our check-in was seamless and he always responded promptly to our requests. He spent most of the time away, but the time we did spend with him he generously passed on some great knowledge about the local art scene, restaurants, bars, jazz clubs and some good tips on getting around. This really enhanced our experience in NYC. \n\nThanks for a wonderful time! I have no doubt in recommending Erik’s apartment to anyone!

Great location, just a 2 minute walk to Bondi Road.\r\n\r\nIf you rent a car then plan to spend 5 minutes looking for a parking place along Penkivil St, and perhaps walk a few hundred yards to the building. We had no problems parking in the building's driveway to load/unload luggage.\r\n\r\nI met George just once during the stay, when we locked ourselves out. He immediately responded to my message and I went to get spares from him. Worked out fine and we lost only the time it took me to drive to his work and back - around a half hour.\r\n\r\nAll my communications with George were very quick. Everything he told us was true and I would recommend staying at his place. Enjoy!"}]}

They gave us good directions on how to find their home, its tucked away behind a few other homes on a dirt road so it can be tricky.

It was windy at night and we fell asleep listening to the leaves moving in the wind and rain.  Occasionally we had to shut the window if the wind blew the rain in.  The a/c is in the living room/kitchen area so it doesn't help to keep the bedroom cool. With both windows open and the fan they provided, we were able to get the air moving in the room and cool the room down at night.  They have a Queen size bed in room #2.\r\n\r\nThe home is a few minutes away from Sunset, Shark's Cove and other beaches and about 15 minutes away from Hale'iwa.  We enjoyed being close to the North Shore Beaches. There is a 3 mile bike path close to the home that goes along the street and has some trees as a buffer from the street. \r\n\r\nThe cottage is in the country and we enjoyed seeing the critters outside, but didn't enjoy them as much when they came inside our bedroom.

The kitchen and restroom were equipped with everything we needed including great water pressure in the shower.  The bed was very comfortable and the night breezes felt nice with the windows open. We were able to use their beach cruiser bikes for short rides to local surf beaches on the North Shore. Surf and snorkel gear were always available to use. It was nice to have a home base on the North side to stay while traveling around the Island. Coming back to the Cottage felt like coming back home.

A beautiful, peaceful, seemingly private, beach is just a couple minutes walk across the street and several more are a short drive away. We enjoyed the proximity to activities we were interested in-Polynesian Cultural Center, Waimea Falls, surf lessons, snorkeling(they have equipment you may borrow). I stayed with my four year old daughter and Alison and Gary were very friendly to us,  even digging out some toys and coloring books for the little one. We felt welcome in the shared space and spent some down time hanging out in the living room watching TV or eating food we picked up at the grocery store nearby. The room is comfortable with plenty of closet space, good bed, and an AC unit. The hosts didn't mind that I arrived early and left a hidden key for me so that I could leave our bags and go off exploring. Overall, we had a great stay here and I'd recommend it, I liked staying here even better than the big Waikiki resort we went to for the rest of our Oahu vacation.

We hope that the room addition turns out nicely. We want you to become SUPERHOSTS- At the good speed that you are developing, perhaps, you can rent out a larger home with 2-3 restrooms. Use the auto-feature to send accurate directions to guests who book and please include that the home is in the back of the alley. Especially after dark, guests can spend upto an hour trying to figure out the hyphenated address.\nAn investment into a new mattress will pay off in 4-7 nights' stay. \nThe restroom and kitchen could use some TLC and elbow grease. I love your new refrigerator and the hardwood floors. Thank you for sharing your stories about your world travels.

Right down the street from the 7 mile \u0026 other great surf breaks if you’re a surfer (pipeline, sunset, v-land, etc.) I enjoyed talking to them \u0026 playing with their adorable dog. Will definitely stay here next year \u0026 whenever I make my way back to the North Shore. :) Thank you Allison \u0026 Gary!!"},{"_id":"205035470","date":{"$date":"2017-10-20T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7536867","reviewer_id":"27602523","reviewer_name":"Nicole","comments":"We only spent one night at Allisons \u0026 Garys place, but we felt very welcome and Allison prepared another room for us, so we could sleep with open window instead of AC.

Driving up to the house was difficult (up an unpaved road with potholes), parking was difficult (as close to the house as possible as there are about 5 or 6 other cars you have to contend with), and the house wasn't as clean as pictured. Though it's a given that houses near beaches will have some measure of sand, that doesn't excuse the amount of sand in the bathtub and general uncleanliness of the room/bathroom. If you're looking for proximity to beaches, and just a convenient place to sleep, this is the place for you. If you're looking for some measure of cleanliness and comfort (you will be sharing the bathroom with around 6 people), you might want to consider another location."},{"_id":"207250676","date":{"$date":"2017-10-28T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7536867","reviewer_id":"40898662","reviewer_name":"Patrick","comments":"Awesome.

Les hôtes manques de temps pour en faire une place bien et il y a un potentiel énorme ! C'est une maison louée qui à besoin de beaucoup de rénovations et surtout d'améliorations (plus de rangement). La salle de bain est à refaire. Ne soyez pas surpris de voir le robinet de la cuisine mal fixé. C'est un endroit parfait pour de jeunes gens en voyages et qui ne font que passer et qui ont un budget serré mais nous n'avons pas aimé.

Gary offered us snorkeling gear and Allison allowed us to eat anything in the kitchen- we were going to buy cereal and she kindly offered what they had in the pantry! \n\nWe would definitely come again, the beach across the road was by far our favourite on the North Shore (it was a very quiet beach too, not popular like Waimea or Sunset).

The location is reasonable with good access to the bus and subway system with either being a only short walk away. Unfortunately the location is also at the corner of a main street that's light controlled and between the hours of 9pm and midnight the traffic noise was constant and loud. Music at full volume and acceleration at full throttle seems to be the norm. The bedroom is on the street side! There are numerous maintenance issues with the suite some of which I consider serious from a safety perspective. The wiring in the suite is questionable with lights dimming and switches/plugs installed incorrectly. The tub/shower arrangement needs a grab bar and a non-slip surface installed. A towel rack and a shelf or two would be helpful as well. The stove fan is falling down and the cupboard doors and drawers need handles! The mattress and the couches need to be updated. They've seen better days and are back breakers. The other issues are purely routine maintenance but ones that should be checked and addressed prior to each guests arrival. Aside from the traffic issue which the host can't control,  I couldn't recommend Mitchell Manor in it's present condition.

After emailing Nicole four times to arrange check in we ended up arriving at the time I had stated we would. \nKnocking on door for a good 15 minutes, no answer even though she knew we were coming. Thankfully her lovely neighbour was leaving her house next door and tried calling Nicole for us to let her know we were standing out the front, still no answer! \nWe then had to leave our luggage with her neighbour as I had also stated via email to Nicole that we had to be in manhattan as we had plans to meet friends from Australia who we only had the day to spend with after not seeing then for three years. \nWe then had to go to a Starbucks in manhattan to see if I recieved a response from Nicole as we had no phones only email access. She then told me that she was home the whole time but couldn't hear us knocking?? And then told us to come back and check in at either 3pm or 8:30pm as they were the only times she could be available so after ruining our whole day and plans with our friends we then had to commute all the way from manhattan to brooklyn just to check in and get the keys! We then arrived at the door as Nicole had said she was home waiting for us, was knocking again for a further 15minutes and surely enough, no answer again!! At this point we thought someone was playing us for a joke! We then knocked on her neighbours door again to call her for us! \nI have never been so frustrated!!\nNicole arrived eventually and stated she had to 'pop' out quickly, seriously?? \nNice place inside and friendly neighbourhood. Slept on fold out couch and was given sheets, the sheets and pillow cases were full of hair, emailed Nicole to let her know this and request new sheets, there was no 'sorry' just 'I'll bring them down later' \nWould have been an enjoyable stay had all of this not gone pear shaped so unfortunately I cannot recommend this place for that reason.

Check in was easy. Nicole answered every single text massage very quick and even provided some bottled water for those who don't like tap water. Everything was clean and safe even though the neighborhood seems a little bit \"strange\" when your origin is a typical german town. However, it took us like 2-3 days to get used to it and then we liked it. There's a small Deli right across the street. They have very delicious sandwiches for a god price. There's a hip coffeeshop and a grocery store right next to it. So that's fine.  \nThe subway is a 5 min walk and it takes you about 40 min to Times Square, 20 min to Lower Manhattan. \nThe night trains don't stop at Kingston Throop Ave so that's a little minus. So you have to figure out a way to get home which is usually by taxi cap. \n\nSo in conclusion: Nicole is a very very nice host. She lives in the house so if you need anything or just want to say Hello she's there for a small talk. \nThe apartement is just fine. \nIt does require a lot of subway traveling to get to Upper Manhattan. \nBed Stuy is a family friendly part of Brooklyn.

The apartment was in a nice neighborhood and it was easy to access transportation to get to the city.  It was very clean and it had everything we needed from towels to kitchenware and everything in between.  When we were leaving, they met us and helped us with our things and to hail a cab!

Mitchel Manor met our requirements being only a 5 minute walk to the subway stop and taking just 20 minutes to lower Manhattan and about 40 minutes to mid town. We found the accommodation to be accurately described and Nicole responded promptly to any queries and was very friendly to deal with. We would readily recommend this apartment.\r\n\r\nSome tips for visitors. The nearest subway is Kingston Throop, Turn right on leaving the apartment and then immediately right onto Marcus Garvey Glvd followed by a right on Fulton street. The subway is just past a McDonalds. Even if you are only staying for a few days it is worthwhile to buying an unlimited 7 day subway ticket for about 30 dollars as individual trips cost 3 dollars. Take the uptown C train to Manhattan. Late night trains do not stop at Kingston Throop. In this case take the downtown A or C train to the next stop at Utica. This is only a little further from Mitchel Manor, about 8 minutes walk. Make sure you visit the Brooklyn bridge for its spectacular views of NY, particularly at night. The C and A trains stops close by at High St. (keep a close lookout for the turn off for the bridge as it is very easy to miss)\r\n\r\nI would also recommend trying two restaurants close to the apartment. Turn right on Decatur St and left on Lewis ave.  Peaches is almost immediately on the right and Saraghina is a few minutes on the left. Both have a great atmosphere, reasonable food and are great value.  There is a supermarket close by on Marcus Garvey and a larger one on Fulton street just up from the Kingston Throop stop. \r\n"},{"_id":"40922212","date":{"$date":"2015-08-03T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"753687","reviewer_id":"35226776","reviewer_name":"Nathalie","comments":"Très bien accueillis par Nicole qui nous a montré des documents, des livres, un plan de métro sur New-York et qui nous a parlé  du quartier.

Everything went smooth during our stay. Our hosts sent us all information we needed in advance and reached out to see if the check-in went well. They also reached out by text during the stay to see if everything was OK. We could see that they cared about our experience.\nThe studio offers everything that we needed, including kitchen and appliances. You access the unit using an external stair, so keep that in mind if you have mobility limitations. \nThe place was clean, and according to the pictures. Walking distance to the beach and a short drive from a small supermarket. Plus, 808 Boards is close by and offers good options for rentals.\nWe rented a small car so I can't comment on the use of transit or walking distances. The complex has a small pool with a barbecue, but we stayed outside for most of the time. \nWe would certainly stay in their place again in the future."},{"_id":"265953413","date":{"$date":"2018-05-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7546623","reviewer_id":"40002760","reviewer_name":"Edwin","comments":"This place is really close to a great snorkeling spot.

We got to the bus stop near the place at 1pm and no one was there to meet with us. I had to call once i got there and we were accommodated 20 to 25 minutes later upon our arrival. A big plus to this place is that it is just a few steps from Nathan Road. About 3 blocks away from jordan station. The place was very clean and spacious. There are restaurants, department stores and convenience store nearby if you need to get anything. My only comment during our stay was the fact that shampoo for bathing and laundry soap to wash the dishes was not adequate. I raised this issue on the first night as they visited the unit but their only reply to me was it can last for the duration of our stay. Well it did not. It ran out in the first 2 days fortunately we brought our own. I understand they are not a hotel but with the amount that they charge, they should at least refill this for the next guests that would be staying there. Refilling will not in any way hurt their income. There were only 2 sets of fork \u0026 spoon. The place could accommodate 10 guests and this is not enough. We were 4 adults. Although there were chopsticks, if you are not used to using them then its difficult to use.

We asked numerous questions.  Instructions from the airport to his property were very clear.  We were greeted upon arrival to a nearby bus stop and escorted to the unit.  A warm introduction and tour was included.  \r\n\r\nThe accommodations were spacious.  There is no heater in the unit, but blankets were provided. Our visit was in February and although cold and rainy outside, the home was suitable.  Late spring and summer are warmer months.  Yau was very accommodating as he addressed building issues (issues beyond his control) as well as any one could.  \r\n\r\nThe unit has the basics.  Nothing fancy and everything works.  There's a cook top, place settings to serve and cook a home cooked meal.  Refrigerator was of an appropriate size.  We didn't find a grocery store in the area but there was one one metro stop away. \r\n\r\nThe unit is very convenient and 2 blocks north of the Jordan MTR station.  \r\n\r\nOn the negative side, the bathroom could have been cleaner.  Moisture control is difficult in a windowless room.  The tub had mildew and the floors were difficult to keep dry. Cleaning supplies and mop were accessible.  Yau had numerous pairs of slippers available.  Slippers and a mop fixed this issue.  I mention this one negative for fairness to Yau and future guests.  If you are expecting a level of polish typical of a franchise hotel in a western metropolis, you will be disappointed here.  This unit, despite this one issue, is a great value considering the location, price and size.   You will be able to pay more for other accommodations, but get less value.  We stayed at Yau's for five days in a group of 7 adults and two toddlers.  We were comfortable for the few hours per day that we were \"home\" between trips all over town.  Did I say it was only 2 blocks from the MTR?\r\n\r\nFiguratively speaking, our stay was like staying with extended family members who were in college; the place had a functional minimalism.  At the same time it felt like Yau communicated and addressed issues to please as though accountable to a mutual family member.  I would stay at this property again, but after asking to stay at Grandma's.

His apartment located at an old building next to Novotel Hotel in Nathan Street. Airport bus #A21 stop very near to the apartment. MTR Jordan is few blocks away. Same line as Tsim Sha Tsui and Mongkok stations.\n\nThe apartment itself is very basic. There are 3 rooms which can comfortably accomodate 6 people. There is a sofa bed but really in a bad shape. The bed is clean enough but the bedroom needed a cupboard - to hang the jacket and towel. One room doesn't even have a door knob! There's no curtains at the window so we just prayed that nobody saw us or secretly filming us changing the clothes...\n\nI have no issues with the bathroom. Everything works just fine, and quite clean.\n\nThe kitchen really needed new / additional utensils. Only 2 forks and a spoon available so we have to take turn eating when dine in. There's a convenient store downstairs. However, one thing that puzzled me is that we can't find any store that sell egg within few blocks from the apartment! \n\nWe would highly recommend this apartment for those who are planning to explore Kowloon area, Nathan Street in particular. Very easy to move around but make sure you are accompanied by male companion if you want to go out at night.\n\nOverall I found this apartment worth the value. If you want a hotel type then this apartment is not for you.\n\n"},{"_id":"113290971","date":{"$date":"2016-11-11T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7564603","reviewer_id":"56312463","reviewer_name":"Den","comments":"Very spacious.

He was supposed to meet us in Jordan MTR but he wasn't there. We had to ask for directions going to his place. Also, you'd expect the house to be ready upon arrival but in our case it wasn't. The previous guests were still there. The place was still a mess and had to be cleaned by his assistant.

We even called him from the train station to confirm we were on time. We stood in front of the metro station for almost an hour waiting. Then when we got there it was nothing like the pictures. It was filthy. Every surface was stained or covered in mold or dust. It had not been cleaned in months. The toilet stopped working one night because the tank wouldn’t fill with water.

The best thing about it was definitely the location (very close to Pl. Catalunya, which makes it easy to go anywhere in the city by foot or public transport).\nThe check-in is not straight-forward, you receive instructions to go to a different place (10minutes away by foot, which can seem really long in the heat of the day and carrying backpacks and suitcases) to pick up the key to the apartment. The furniture looks nice but the quality is the same as the furniture from Ikea, and the 300€ deposit is way more than I think that furniture is worth. The kitchen is honestly the part of the apartment I disliked the most. Every cabinet you open smells, and that doesn't mean just the garbage under the sink and the dishwasher (and yes, it smells even though it's empty). The cabinet containing the dishes, bowls and glasses smelled so bad I swear we had to wash everything very thoroughly before using it. I also really don't like the fact that, considering the 70€ you have to pay for the cleaning service at the end of your stay, you also have to specifically leave the apartment in good conditions (they instruct you to actually clean the dishes and empty the garbage cans). I found this very stressful, considering the 300€ blocked on my credit card as a deposit (which the house rules state can be charged in full if you the rules and requirements are ignored). I would not stay in this apartment or any other by this agency again."},{"_id":"326089529","date":{"$date":"2018-09-21T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7610100","reviewer_id":"196720807","reviewer_name":"Kyounghwa","comments":"It was nice location to go where you want to go.

The location is perfect, one block from a busy street, that we never heard any noise from. It's a quiet neighbourhood with little traffic on the street out front. A metro station and large grocery store and drug store are a 2 minute walk, so you can get any necessities and get anywhere in Montreal easily. You don't need a car to navigate the city from here. Andrea communicated clearly and accurately described her apartment and neighbourhood. Most enjoyable, thanks!"}]}

The flat itself was spotlessly clean and utilitarian Ikea in feel. The flat does not feel like someone's private residence, more an apartment used specifically for efficient short term Airbnb lets, so don't expect any quirky individual character. You will find the kitchen and shower rooms at the other end of a long internal corridor, both were clean and efficient. \r\nWe stayed for 4 nights in October when the weather was poor and rather chilly. N.B The apartment had no form of heating, as such, I would personally only suggest staying here when the climate is more predictably warm, to avoid having to wear as many clothes inside as you do out.  \r\nThe neighbourhood is one of the better parts in the historic district with some really nice restaurants and cafes in the same street as the apartment. In our experience here in Porto particularly, it's probably prudent to eat where others, particularly locals are eating. \r\nFor those looking to get around greater Porto, we found the local bus system impressive with many services accessed locally. The Metro although impressive, serves other areas better than the apartments own neighbourhood, although was useful for getting to the airport.

Trevor was a dream from check-in to check-out, he gave us a ton of tips. Not that we needed them, the biggest tip is walk out your front door! You can literally walk outside to one of the most amazing beaches we've ever seen. We've thought about buying a place for years, but we've just decided to make this our home one month a year, not only is it cheaper, everything's handled- the internet is fast, there's a big tv loaded with Netflix, the apartment's beautifully managed and furnished with a eye to ever last detail. \r\n\r\nHonestly I can't say enough good things. The only other thing you need to know is how wonderful it is to go to sleep and wake up with the gentle crash of the waves outside. WE WILL BE BACK! Thank you Trevor, really appreciated the stay.

It is out of the tourist area; the building is a combination of locals living there and visitors renting for a month or so. The condo was clean and well supplied to make the stay comfortable. The beach chairs, umbrella and cooler were a big plus. The building was well kept and secure, always a security guard on duty.\r\n\r\nTrevor and Joy were good to answer questions prior to the trip, checked in on us upon arrival, answered questions and made suggestions of activities in the area. When we contacted them they were always available.\r\n\r\nEvery morning we enjoyed coffee on balcony, overlooking the beach, often seeing turtles and dolphins. In early January whales were sighted several times.\r\n\r\nThe beach was beautiful. My daughter got in and out of the water easily even with the bigger waves. I was little more apprehensive, but did learn the trick of getting in and out of the water. We also visited other beaches close by and on the north and east coasts. .\r\n\r\nSunsets were lovely; we went to a couple of close by beaches to capture the different colours.\r\n\r\nA car was necessary to get around; groceries shops about 10 minutes away, Costco about 25 minutes and a drive to the north shore about an hour and 20 minutes. Roads were excellent and well marked.\r\n\r\nWe enjoyed the walk around the point in the Ka’ena State Park- saw nesting albatross birds and monk seals lazing in a pool, drinks and food at the Sunset Cafe a couple of times, Dolphin Excursion trip with a breakfast/ lunch from the Spinners restaurant in the same location, Polynesian Culture Centre, Diamond Head, Pearl Harbour and the Swap market that happens on Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday, waterfall at Waimea Valley. Locally, there is a Farmer’s market on Saturdays just beyond Long’s. The trip was really a great combination of relaxation and sightseeing."},{"_id":"60672593","date":{"$date":"2016-01-25T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7624525","reviewer_id":"30117187","reviewer_name":"Bryce","comments":"Amazing beachfront place.

The highlight of our time there was the beach, which is really good. Clear water, nice sand, amazing sunsets. It was never too busy, you could often see the turtles and we'd always sleep to the sound of the waves. There's an entrance to the beach from within the complex, so it couldn't be any easier to get to it.\r\n\r\nThe location is a bit far away from everything (on average, 30 minutes from Kapolei and 1h from Honolulu) but we knew that before, and it can be a good thing if you want to spend some time on your own. There's a supermarket and a few fast food restaurants nearby in Waianae. It seems to be a low income neighborhood but we didn't have any problems.\r\n\r\nThe apartment itself is not in great shape. The appliances and furniture are not new, but that didn't bother us much. The biggest problem we had with the property was that it wasn't clean. In fact, it seems like it hasn't been properly cleaned in a very long time. When we arrived, not even basic cleaning had been performed: even obvious surfaces like the front of the fridge were dirty. We contacted the host and they asked their cleaners to come back 2 days later. Unfortunately, it wasn't a professional cleaning crew. They lacked equipment (such as a decent vacuum cleaner) and materials (bleach and various specialized stain removers). They spent 2 hours cleaning the property, but after they left we still spent another day trying to do a proper clean up. Unfortunately, several spots remained dirty: curtains, carpets and all the hard-to-reach spots (corners, spaces under the furniture, closet).\r\n\r\nAirbnb did its best to try to address our concerns, but after interacting with the cleaning crew (who hadn't even looked behind the sofa) we essentially gave up on trying to address the cleaning problem with our host, since there seemed to be a mismatch of expectations.\r\n\r\nThe host was flexible with our check-out time as a way of apologizing, and also offered to reimburse us for a few things we bought.\r\n\r\nOverall I think I'd come back to this area, but not to this specific property."},{"_id":"229306485","date":{"$date":"2018-01-22T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7624525","reviewer_id":"10858955","reviewer_name":"Valerie","comments":"Trevor’s place is cozy and in an outstanding location.

The place is clean in general and host and his friend are nice and responsive. However, there are a few things didn't meet our expectation.\n\n1. The WiFi mentioned in the info sent to us after booking was never working. Host mentioned he will ask the telecom to fix, but it never happened. Host provided us with a hotspot device on the second day. But it stopped working after two nights. Although host mentioned he called provider to fix, but the issue persisted till the end of our trip. Therefore, we didn't have WiFi for most time of the trip.\n\n2. We found a couple small roaches in the shower space and kitchen. But honestly speaking, it might be the problem of the whole building or Hawaii.\n\n3. The second bed is actually an air bed which is not mentioned in the info. And personally we feel it less comfortable than a real one.\n\n4. Last, when we checked out, we were told to just leave the key in the kitchen. But the elevator requires the key to go to the garage. We had to ask the host in the last min to figure out how to leave and the solution was to hide the key in the garage. This might not be a big deal, but made us wondering how previous tenants handled the check out before that host never realized this issue?"},{"_id":"402841708","date":{"$date":"2019-01-19T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7650220","reviewer_id":"52359117","reviewer_name":"Yiner","comments":"It is a very nice apartment with great ocean view, especially when you get up in the morning, you could see the airplanes crossing and the blue ocean is the background. It is in the city center with high standard safety guard. The garage is very nice and they have a fix parking lot. We could add the gasoline easily. We could buy stuff easily. It is close to the shopping mall. The apartment has two rooms. The main bedroom is big enough with a nice bathroom. The second bedroom is an air bed. But do not worry because it is even better then the real bed I stayed in Maui, because it can be added the air very easily (not the pump you have to do by yourself, it is just a button on the wall. It can add the air automatically). There is a Guitar in the room. It’s a pity that I do not how to use it. We can cook by the way, they have a nice big open kitchen together with the living room.

It is not luxurious, it is basic. Very minimal. In the business district. \nOur check in contact (which is offsite) was 5 hours late, the dishwasher was broken (the check in contact knew this before we arrived), the light in the master bedroom was broken due to wiring (the check in contact knew this before we arrived), the second bedroom at the time was not advertised as an AIR MATTRESS, no coffee maker until I went and bought one, not enough dishes for four people, no beach equipment/towels, it looks like they recently replaced the floor but did not finish the molding, kitchen was not bad but not sparkling clean, hooks in the walls from previous artwork but art is now gone. The place felt like a bachelor pad they decided to move out of one day and put it on Airbnb the next. \nThis apartment has great potential with polishing, work, and repairs but as it was in Jan 2019 it fell short of the description. \nAlso, there are weird rules about not being able to use the front door/lobby of the building. It did not feel like we were guests allowed to be renting the apartment, it felt like we were intruders staying there illegally. \nSarah is nice on email, the contact (Lester) in Hawaii is a nice guy, but the place is less than luxurious and we felt uneasy staying there."},{"_id":"410851635","date":{"$date":"2019-02-10T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7650220","reviewer_id":"82221726","reviewer_name":"Daniel","comments":"Great location and value"},{"_id":"412532046","date":{"$date":"2019-02-15T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7650220","reviewer_id":"31429840","reviewer_name":"Meng","comments":"This is the perfect place for tourists that will spend most time outside of the place, and it will not be as great if you want to constantly enter and exit the place, as you need to be cautious about not exposing yourself or your airbnb experience to the community.

Paul and Josh are fantastic hosts. The house has a \"real beach house\" feel, a true getaway from the more crowded touristic experiences on Oahu. A surfers dream, the most awesome swells rolling in just off the beautiful Lanai( deck). We spent many hours just watching the beautiful sunsets and changes in swell thundering in. Sleeping was a dream, the room comfortable, clean and well provisioned. We chillaxed in a flash. \nPaul is an easygoing , well informed house mate/host. He's a long term resident and a Hawaiian culture specialist. Josh was away during our stay but is very good on communications. Use of the kitchen , laundry, dining and lounge areas made our family feel right at home, the  extra space and facilities gave us the choice of eating in, economising and extending our stay to 10days.\nEhukai (the Labrador) is a delight, her love for the beach and constant company whilst swimming and walking gave our kids a \"pet experiment\" and companionship. \nI'd some up our stay by saying we just didn't want to leave....

The location and house are just as described and the backyard is the world-famous Banzai Pipeline on the North Shore of Oahu. When we first arrived, we were greeted with the sounds of the majestic North Shore waves. We were also welcomed by a wonderful host dog, a golden retriever named Ehukai, who is the friendliest and sweetest dog ever. Ehukai loves the beach and is an expert sand digger! We miss her already.\r\n\r\nPaul (our human host) is very hospitable, responsive and easy going. He is also an academic expert on Hawaiian Studies and happy to share his knowledge. He indulged our curiosity about the cultural and political history of Hawaii. We're sad that we didn't have the opportunity to meet Josh, who corresponded with us about the booking, but maybe we will one day!\r\n\r\nThe lanai has a spectacular view of the beach. There's no bad view - on the left you could watch the sun go down, on the right, you can see surfers ride the Pipeline.\r\n\r\nWe had our own room, private bathroom and parking space. Our bedroom was closer to the highway side and overlooks the front yard. If you leave the windows open, you could still hear the waves crashing, which is awesome as a sleeping aid. The house is conveniently located. It's only a 5 minute drive to Foodland (a grocery serving world class Poke) and delicious shrimp trucks, 10 minutes to Shark's Cove and Waimea Bay, and 15 minutes to downtown Haleiwa and Kahuku. Take note that there's only one road so during sunset, there's a lot of traffic, especially near the beaches. \r\n\r\nEvery moment of our trip was breathtaking and relaxing.

We felt he was a great host. He would chat with us and answer any questions we had but also gave us lots of privacy even though we were guests in his home. You cannot beat the location of Paul's beachhouse. It really is directly on the beach and short distance to many of the North Shore's top spots for snorkelling and hiking. There are tons of food trucks and restaurants close by as well as a Foodland. Our only issue that we came across (which wasn't a reflection of Paul) would be that because it is an older home, the windows do not block much sound and the bedroom faces the road. So it was a little loud at night with trucks and cars passing as well as tons of chickens in the area that kept us awake. Otherwise our stay was excellent and comfortable. You cannot beat this location and the views are incredible!

For us it was location as well as getting a feel for the local vibe. If this is what you are after, then Paul's place hits the mark! Don't come here looking for a five star hotel as this is not what you will find, thank goodness. If you are into the richness of the culture of Hawaii, you can't do any better than staying with Paul and Josh in this original plantation home that is right on the beach at the Banzai Pipeline. \nWe were fortunate to be staying on a weekend which allowed us a bit more time to chat with Paul. He is a master in all things Hawaiian and is incredibly interesting. \nThe house, although quite old, is spotlessly clean. Josh is like the energizer bunny and keeps it clean to a fault. \nWe had a private bedroom with a comfortable king size bed and a private bathroom. There is a large deck where you could spend an entire day being mesmerized by the ocean. The remainder of the house and deck are shared with Paul, Josh, and Ehukai, their adorable golden retriever. All are most respectful of privacy. Even the dog knows where she must not cross the line!\n The kitchen has everything you need to prepare your meals if you wish. Of course, you should clean up after yourself as there is no maid service.\nWe can't wait for our next visit and would likely plan a longer stay.

I strongly recommend this place for any stay in NYC. You won't get a better value for your money! The place is nice, neat and spacious and Jurmain and his dad are great people to meet. Walking through the Bronx ain't a problem since the metro station is close by - the way takes only five minutes on two main streets. Been here with my girlfriend after living for three months on the upper eastside and, sure, it is different - but i didn't feel afraid aboy my girlfriend and me at any time. Jurmain is a superb host - always nice, friendly, calm and super-responsive prebooking AND during your stay. You can ask him or his dad about anything you like and they will always make your stay even more comfortable than it already is. This includes tips for your stay, but also the possibility to use their personal pc and printer; his Dad even offeres me to borrow his car and, for a low wage, Jurmain would even bring you to the airport when your stay ends. All in all i can state: i had a lot of doubts about staying in the bronx with my gf. but they all turned out to be unreasonable and i am more than glad that i stayed with my decision to spend my vacation at The Wielingens - great place, great people!"},{"_id":"69461167","date":{"$date":"2016-04-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7686940","reviewer_id":"30222774","reviewer_name":"Romain","comments":"We had a pleasant stay at Jurmain's place.

Before i booked this place, I had confirmed with Jurmain that if it would be ok if I collect my bags late in the night on the checkout day as my bus back home was at 12 am. He had agreed with that saying it should be perfectly fine if I checkout on time. And hence i booked his place. However his father kept arguing that how it is not correct to do that as his place would look dirty because of this! And I should pay extra if i have to keep the luggage after checkout. He kept arguing even after I told him that jurmain had agreed for this. Ultimately, i had to carry my luggage with me and put it in another storage by paying 40$. While i was completely polite during this conversation, I didn't feel the same. He kept rudely talking to me about that. Overall, i would not recommend this place and would rather pay 20 bucks more to stay at a decent hotel.

I only had a one night stay and didn't realize the extent of it ( like no fitted sheet) only when I was literally about to get in the bed. Host my typically do it right per older review.

Though not located in downtown Barcelona, the apartment was less than a 5 minute walk to easily grab the Metro for any part of the downtown area or the Renfe Train, all of which were only a few stops away.  \r\nNil's communication wish us was most excellent.  He stayed in contact with us prior to and upon arrival at BCN to give us instruction and assistance with where/what/how to easily get to his metro stop without spending a lot of money.  And, though the airport train was experiencing delays, Nil waited at his metro stop for us and helped us with all our luggage to his apartment. \r\nWe found Nil's apartment to be exactly as described.  It was quaint and had everything we needed for a week's visit.  He even surprised us with a few welcoming gifts having known of our long day of flying.  He had a table full of information about the city and for getting around, points of interests, excursions, etc.  This made it easy for us to plan some activities when we first arrived.  \r\nWe found Nil's apartment to be in a safe area with lots of shopping right around the block.  It was clean and decorated nicely.  He provided all the essentials, such as soaps, shampoo, and laundry detergent.  He had pins available to dry clothes off the balcony as well as a table and chairs for having coffee.  We appreciated his Moka Pot for our morning espresso and enjoyed making our breakfast in the apartment before heading out to explore the city.  \r\nNil was a very hospitable host and went out of his way to make sure we got what we needed based on our personal interests.  He texted days/times/locations based on information we requested which made it easy for us to visit those things with the time we had.  He also printed tickets we needed and had them ready for us with no issue.\r\nWe didn't spend much time watching TV, but we did appreciate that there were two as we enjoyed music from the one in the bedroom. Also, we appreciated that the wifi connection was fast and reliable.  The bedding was very comfortable, and we rested well.  Nil even had extra blankets and comforters, which we prefer.  There was more than enough space for storing our belongings out of the way, and though a small space, we never once felt like we were tripping over one another.  \r\nNil's laid back personality made packing up to leave easy and  stress-free.  He met with us at check-out and asked for feedback/ suggestions for the apartment because he cares about the service he is providing.  He helped us carry all our luggage down the one flight of stairs and hailed us a cab and communicated to the driver our destination.  Obviously, we quite enjoyed our stay at Nil's and would definitely recommend his place to others.

The smart TV and ability to use the kitchen and washing machine were great extra touches. We'd definitely look him up again if we are lucky enough to come back. Thanks Nil.\n\n---\n\nTot estava molt bé amb pis de Nil. Es comunicava bé, així que sempre sabíem el que estava passant, el pis estava a prop del metro, un supermercat i un forn de pa així que tenia tot el necessari per a una llar lluny de les multituds de Barcelona.

Although the flat is not directly central, everything you would want to see is within a half hour metro trip with the nearest station a couple of blocks away, and the main centre is only a few stops away. Local shops include basic but ample grocers if you want to cook in. Nil is a great host who responds quickly to enquiries and is keen to help out in any way. The apartment is comfortable and well appointed. We were two friends who slept separately and there was plenty of space for this (one of us is over 6 foot/180cm!) with a big and comfortable folding bed in the living room. One thing to bear in mind if you are a light sleeper is to bring ear plugs as noise from the neighbouring flats was quite intrusive in the evenings and night time. Otherwise highly recommended as a home from home.

Wir waren in der 1. Februarwoche dort, und da die Wohnung  über keine Heizung verfügt, konnte man sich wirklich nur zum Schlafen dort aufhalten. Und das auch nur bedingt, da das Bett direkt an einer kalten Aussenwand mit Einscheibenfenster liegt. Man konnte nicht duschen, da auch das Mikrobad ungeheizt war. Es gab keinen Kaffeekocher und keinen Wasserkocher. Da spielte es schon keine Rolle mehr, das es keine Geschirrtücher gab. Die Wohnung war sehr hellhörig, für Geräusche von den vielen Nachbarn war in der kältebedingt kurzen Nacht ausreichend gesorgt. Da diese gravierenden Mängel in der Beschreibung nicht erkennbar waren, stelle ich airbnb generell in Frage und gehe davon aus, dass bei unserem nächsten Besuch in Barcelona eher ein Hotelzimmer in Betracht kommt."},{"_id":"235584224","date":{"$date":"2018-02-17T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7697720","reviewer_id":"58048539","reviewer_name":"Ana","comments":"The apartment was ok.

I had to took the Metro back to UQAM (7 stations) to get MacDonald, but still couldn't find those cleaning products...\r\n\r\nUse (Hidden by Airbnb) Map wisely...\r\n\r\nAurelien is nice but I only met him twice in the 6 days stay...

We honeymooned in Kauai for 6 nights and the condo was the perfect fit for us! We'd been told by several family members and friends that the North Shore was the place to stay in Kauai, and now we couldn't agree more. Although it's the rainier side and is a less central location, it is, in our opinion, the prettiest side! We enjoyed the Princeville Center (Lei Petite was an excellent coffee/breakfast stop) and our favorite town on Kauai was Hanalei - about 10 minutes from the condo. We drove all over the island and although it was a bit of a trek to the west side we were still able to easily do it all in one day at a leisurely pace. The condo itself looks just as the photos depict. The loft is larger than I thought, although you have to watch your head on the beams on one side of the bed. It's airy and comfortable for 2 people. The bed was incredibly comfortable and the bedding was cool for those warm evenings. There is no ceiling fan in the loft but two table top fans keep it cool enough (as long as you don't mind the noise of them, which we didn't). There are two ceiling fans above the living area. The kitchen was fairly well equipped and had a dishwasher (although there was no dishwasher soap, just Dawn dish soap for hand washing) and we made a few meals while we were there easily. The knives really need sharpening and a toaster would be handy. We had a few ant issues near the trash can but I think that's probably typical for the island. The TV comes with a Roku for your Netflix/Hulu/Sling TV viewing pleasures and the wifi worked well. The bathroom is a good size but could use a hair dryer for forgetful ladies like myself! I thought the proximity to the neighbors might be a problem (especially with all the doors and windows open all the time) but we didn't have any issues. The walking trail back near the golf course is just lovely for watching the sunrise or stargazing in the evenings. The lanai is large and has a great greenery view. I do wish there was a small table and chairs for breakfast out on the lanai. We never went to the pool - who needs a pool when you're on an island?! The electronic lock on the door was being finicky when we arrived and had to be replaced. We were able to get a hold of the host easily when we were having issues. It was replaced the next day but we weren't notified that they'd be coming. We came back from the beach to someone fixing the lock. Probably would have been good to know they were coming first but it wasn't a big deal and we were happy to not have any further issues getting in after the new..."},{"_id":"51439278","date":{"$date":"2015-10-20T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7715270","reviewer_id":"41765710","reviewer_name":"Sarah","comments":"We absolutely loved Leilani Loft! Mana was very welcoming from the first email, and sent us some great suggestions of hikes and things to do. She was very easy to communicate with. The loft itself was very clean, and really felt like home. It really does have everything you need. Being an end unit, the living area has a lot of windows which provide plenty of air flow, making it cool and refreshing in most of the apartment. The bed is very comfy, and we slept well. Plus, the location was just superb - we became big fans of Foodland which is very close. It's very easy to drive from Princeville to many other parts of the island. And the hike up Hanakapi'ai falls is just amazing - not to be missed if you are physically able and have the time to do it. It didn't take us long to drive to the start of the trail from the apartment, which is important when you need to get there early to find a parking spot!\r\n\r\nThe path to the local beach is great and right behind the loft, although it is steep at the end and can be muddy - wear your sneakers! And then you'll need to wade across the stream to get a beach you can actually sit on. So it's not quite an easy stroll that you can make with flip flops and massive beach bags, but still super cool.\r\n\r\nI was scanning everyone else's reviews for reports about rooster noise, so here is mine - you can hear roosters sometimes, if they wander close by. But I never got woken up by one, so all is good, and it doesn't seem like any were living right under the windows. I will say that the fans in the sleeping loft are a bit loud, and we were using them partly for white noise (you can hear people in the neighboring apartment otherwise) so that may have helped us also with not being woken by roosters. The airflow and fan noise in the sleeping loft might be my only slight complaint - as there are no windows upstairs it can get warm up there without the fans going. Still, even with that very small issue, I would not hesitate to go back."},{"_id":"53207395","date":{"$date":"2015-11-06T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7715270","reviewer_id":"6691253","reviewer_name":"Devon","comments":"Beautiful loft - we really enjoyed our stay here.

We had friends staying near by and cooked together most mornings and in the evening which was lovely. Things to be aware of, it is the more lush tropical side of the island so there are bugs, though we followed instructions and saw none in the apartment, so definitely stick to this. As people have mentioned you can hear roosters throughout the night and general traffic but this seems typical of all of Kauai and we didn't find it bothersome. You can't here the neighbours below or next door in the main part of the apartment. In the bedroom you can hear the apartment next door quite clearly, but as we were only sleeping here and our neighbours were quiet at this time it wasn't a problem, and we knew we could contact someone if it was.

This unit is located in a small apartment complex made up of mostly 2 story buildings.  The unit backs up to a golf course.  The view is obscured through the trees, but that didn't bother us much.  The trail to Anini Beach passes right behind the building, and definitely worth a look.  The apartment itself is comfortable for two adults, with a full kitchen as well as a washer \u0026 dryer.  The kitchen has had a refresh, and looks good.  Everything we needed was there, and the appliances we used worked just fine.  It has a TV, which we were happy to say we never turned on.  Kauai is outside, why would you want to watch TV?  :)\r\n\r\nOne thing to note, this is not a hotel.  That's great in lots of ways, but less great in others.  The downstairs neighbors are residents, and they had a huge fight while we were there (about a library card of all things).  You can pretty much hear every word.  I'd still choose to stay here again on my next Kauai visit, just keep in mind that this is an actual apartment complex and not a hotel.\r\n\r\nAltogether, we really enjoyed the place.

We also loved how we could keep the windows and backdoor open since it there are screens throughout the apartment.

In the lofted bedroom, you can hear the apartment next door quite clearly, but as we were only sleeping here and our neighbours were quiet at this time it wasn't a problem, and we knew we could contact someone if it was. Overall this was a wonderful place to stay, and so much better than a hotel. We would definitely recommend staying here!"},{"_id":"88495910","date":{"$date":"2016-07-24T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7715270","reviewer_id":"25061212","reviewer_name":"Brittany","comments":"Our stay at the Leilani Loft was wonderful.

The kitchen was equipped with the basic tools we needed, but they don't keep any cooking spray or oil for the pans so make sure to get some if you plan on cooking. we really enjoyed watching for all the lizards, but if you don't like lizards this isn't the place for you. Also, the loft upstairs had a low, angled ceiling and my husband knocked his head a few times.

The place is lovely, comfortable and well-equipped. There's a beautiful ocean view just steps from your door, and it's close to Hanalei (2.5 miles) and lots of great beaches (though the walk to Anini Beach is pretty steep and doesn't take you to the best part of  the beach. We drove to Anini Beach Park and liked that better.)  We especially liked the deck, which has comfortable furniture and looks out on a wooded walking path which is filled with birds singing.  We also enjoyed the pool a lot.  Diana was very accessible, including when we had to call her to get the code to the door again after getting locked out right away by a gust of wind!   One caveat - the ceiling is very low on one  side of the  loft, so  the person sleeping on that  side of the bed is at risk of hitting their head on some low beams.   We had no problems with noise from the  other units.  There were a lot  of roosters crowing at all hours, but they didn't bother us.  We found them charming.

There also was lack of amenities in order to cook including no oil, tongs, etc. There was also no water filtering system - like a Brita. \n\nThe key code was super confusing when we first checked in.

Leilani Loft is situated on the north side of the island in Princeville which in my opinion is the most beautiful side of the island - very green, mountainous, beautiful calm seas and beaches etc. Here are my highlights: (in no particular order!)\n\n- Loved the TV with NETFLIX, Amazon Prime etc. \n- The kitchen was great and we saved money (slightly) by buying food at Foodland and cooking in. The kitchen provided all the utensils required to cook etc.  NOTE: Food out / food in general is very expensive in Kauai...! \n- The bedroom was very cosy although we kept bumping ourselves on the wooden beams.  \n- The appartment got quite hot, especially at night but Mana provided bedside fans and the silky bedsheet made for a perfect night sleep. \n- Princeville is a short drive from Hanalei Bay which has a great beach and great places to eat.  A highlight was Kalypso - nice bar and decent, not overpriced food as can be said about the majority of places on the island.\n- Waimea Canyon is superb and the trails are worth walking\n- Wailea Waterfall kayaking is a fantastic day out.\n- Kalalau Trail is awesome.  There's also a beautiful beach right next to it.\n- Note to those fearing bugs! - I hate bugs and after all the hiking etc. I had expected to see a lot of big tropical spiders but I saw a total of 2 spiders in my whole stay and they were pretty small 1.5\" across... NONE in the house, one cockroach... but the Raid spray under the kitchen sink put an end to that b**** very quickly.\n- Oh and the pool is super close by, no one was using it, it was clean and perfect for relaxing!  \n- The beach nearest the appartment is a 10 minute walk... it is a very peaceful beautiful, calm beach.  Not many people there although with the lack of people there are numerous crabs running about - if you can handle that.  \n\n Thanks Mana, we loved it!"},{"_id":"199421030","date":{"$date":"2017-10-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7715270","reviewer_id":"16458727","reviewer_name":"Kelsey","comments":"Mana's place was perfect for the 4 nights we spent on the north shore.

She was very helpful in getting us oriented with some key landmarks in the area, including the nearest MTR station, some nearby restaurants, and how to get to the museums. \n\nFrom the nearest Airport bus station, it was only a 2 block walk to get to Mirador Mansion. Its very close to The Hong Kong Museum of Art, Avenue of the Stars/Symphony of Lights, and a 10-15 minute walk to the Outer Harbour Ferry to Macau and the Museum of History and Science.\n\nThe room itself was adequate. Don't expect too much space in the rooms. Patrick and I were only concerned about having our own bathroom and having a place to sleep at night. To that extent, the room was enough (there's only 2 channels on the tv though, both local Cantonese... Theres free wifi to surf the internet, though it may at times be slow if all the other rooms are using it as well).\n\nAll in all, it was a pleasant experience. Hassle free check in, Natalie was very helpful, and we got our HK$100 deposit right after checking out.

The location is top-notch, as it's located right in the heart of Kihei and the tourist district in Maui. We loved being just across the street from the beach and able to walk to a wide variety of restaurants and attractions up and down the coastline. The condo itself was fine; I'd call it average. Neither amazing nor underwhelming. it was very large and felt airy, with lots of comfortable living room furniture. The queen bed was great; however, the smaller twin beds were pretty uncomfortable. Definitely recommended for kids over adults. The kitchen appliances were modern and there was plenty of space. The unit was extremely clean. Our biggest problem with the unit is that it's advertised as having AC--which it does--but the AC is permanently set to not go lower than 78 degrees, which is just too warm. We ended up using the AC and keeping the windows open and fans on at night and still didn't feel like there was proper airflow or ventilation in the bedrooms, even though the outdoor air was cooler than the AC was allowed to cool to."},{"_id":"62232387","date":{"$date":"2016-02-13T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7760228","reviewer_id":"15940458","reviewer_name":"Tracy","comments":"Had a wonderful time in Maui!

It was across the street from Charley Young beach (about a half a block distance), just down from the three Kam beaches and there were many restaurants, food trucks,  shops, bars AND gelato/shave ice places nearby (walking distance).  Also, It was really nice for two couples to have two separate full bathrooms. We really enjoyed the welcome basket and made use of all the snacks and coffee. There are plenty of beach towels, beach chairs and even snorkel gear to use. The condo is on the fourth floor so if you are hauling groceries, luggage or are tired or unable to climb stairs, there is an elevator. We also enjoyed the small lanai where we could see the sunrise over the side of Haleakala, see a bit of the ocean and the stars at night.

It's in a fantastic location just a short walk from the beach, and a short walk to lots of stores and popular areas. But it's still quiet and calm at night. The complex has a great heated pool and BBQ area, and we spent a lot of time there -- there's a good mix of residents and vacationers, and everyone seemed friendly and eager for conversation. The units themselves are not generously sized, but definitely have everything you need. The complex is older and not fancy, but comfortable, friendly and clearly cared for by its residents.\n\nPam's unit is lovingly maintained and she includes lots of helpful extras to make the stay extra comfortable, such as beach gear, lots of beach towels, cleaning supplies and more. To be honest, we spent some time at the Grand Wailea, and felt so much more at home at the Pacific Shores condo. We appreciated the air conditioning and how it's able to be controlled by room, and made ample use of the bathroom fans and supplied drying rack. We super appreciated the presence of a removable showerhead in one of the bathrooms, as that makes cleaning kids and rinsing saltwater off of swimsuits so much easier. We enjoyed near-nightly live music from the hotel next door, which we could hear from the lanai. The assigned parking spots add a level of security and make it stress-free to park. I would go back in a heartbeat. \n\nJust a couple tips for fellow travelers - there isn't much pantry space, so don't overbuy items that need pantry storage. Which brings me to my next point... the complex has a problem with sugar ants (sooooo common in Hawaii, not blaming them at all), so you probably don't want to leave anything out anyway. We put everything in the fridge and kept the kitchen meticulously cleaned. A few wipes with a bit of Raid (supplied) in strategic places every now and then kept the problem at bay. If you have mobility issues, bring your patience or ask for a unit on the 1st floor as the elevator is very slow. (But it makes for a fun \"beat the elevator to the 4th floor\" game for kids.)\n\nOverall, great stay; would absolutely recommend to families traveling with kids as well as others."},{"_id":"251351267","date":{"$date":"2018-04-07T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7760228","reviewer_id":"657592","reviewer_name":"Lokesh","comments":"Great location right by the Kihei beaches and dining options.

The condo also had beach gear (mats, towels, chairs) which was nice to borrow and take to the beach. The living area was very pleasantly decorated with a beach theme and the beds were very comfortable.\n\nThe only thing that we did not like during our stay was that someone entered the condo to pick some things when we were out without informing us. We realized this when we noticed that some beach gear that we saw on the first day was not there after we came back from our day out. I am not sure if that is normal when renting a condo via air bnb, but, I did not expect it and made me feel a little uneasy the rest of the trip."},{"_id":"329419956","date":{"$date":"2018-09-28T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7760228","reviewer_id":"183793170","reviewer_name":"Kaleb","comments":"Walking distance to a great sandy beach.

It seemed like only one room at a time, out of the three rooms, was being cooled down by the a/c. But after reading the a/c manual, we learned that all 3 remotes had to be set to \"cool\" (for some reason, one of them was set to \"heat\") in order for all 3 air conditioners to function at the same time. Until we found that out, only the first one that was turned on would actually cool the room. The other 2 were \"on\", but not blowing any cool air!

There were 3 queen beds and a twin day bed which was more that enough for our party of 6. Living room was small, but that was fine, since we were out most of the day. The place is in a great location, walking distance to the main walking streets and restaurants (st. Laurent blvd, st. Denis, etc.).\r\n\r\nThe area does remain rather active late into the night, so there's street noise coming in (people talking/shouting, police cars, etc.) to the unit if you leave the windows open at night. There's no central air (we were there in the summer), but fans were provided in every room. It was still fairly hot inside with the windows open. \r\n\r\nOverall the stay was pleasant, location is great.

Boulevard Saint-Laurent is just a block over and has a ton of nice cafes, restaurants, and bars, and the Vieux-Port is a 20-30 minute walk from the apartment. The area seemed to get pretty crowded with a teenage party crowd on the Friday and Saturday nights we were there, which made the two front bedrooms a little noisy as their windows face the street.\r\n\r\nThe Flatbook team was very responsive and organized.

We chose that specific apartment because it has four separate bedrooms for the four of us and because of the proximity to the McGill university. The problem was that there was not hot water in the shower!!! In the Canadian weather of -2 to 10 degrees it did not make any sense to us. We asked for it to be repaired and although they tried it did not change at all. We were offered to move to different apartment but the apartments that were offered were not as close to the university and had only 3 bedrooms. We do want to mention that in all other aspects the apartment was great and flatbook also helped us get a big taxi to go the the airport. But at last we had a week of cold showers which made a really bad experience to us overall. When we book an apartment that is a basic thing that we expect.\r\n"},{"_id":"55233920","date":{"$date":"2015-11-29T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7762339","reviewer_id":"14517639","reviewer_name":"Beth","comments":"This apartment was great.

The room is very quiet and perfect - clean sheets, towels... the room is a nice size to simply sleep and plan the day. The common space is expertly decorated as Sean has true style. I wanted to stay with someone similarly minded to myself with a good vibe and he was exactly that. He had one roommate who I didn't see but once during my three night stay. I saw Sean once in a while and he was nothing but friendly. The neighborhood is Hasidic while central to different hip areas of Brooklyn.

The room is in a basement as noted and the only window is in the bathroom so the room is on the dark side and probably great for day sleepers!

The room was sufficient for the type of trip we planned since we planned to be on the beach or out and about most of time."},{"_id":"186129298","date":{"$date":"2017-08-23T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7774167","reviewer_id":"72586767","reviewer_name":"Marcus","comments":"Clean and exactly as described.

Si paras en Manhattan esta todo mas cerca pero por el triple del precio. En el alojamiento de Vanda, es mucho mas económico, y como quien va de visita a Nueva York, solo va al alojamiento a descansar, el lugar de Vanda me pareció espectacular con relación al precio y comodidad. Si bien es cierto que esta en la parte de abajo de su casa, es cómodo, tiene un estar y un dormitorio separados, un pequeño baño y una cocina para desayunar. Lo de los techos bajos, no es así ya que nos movimos con total comodidad. Si bien es cierto que se escuchan los pasos del piso superior, nos ayudaba para levantarnos temprano y tomarnos el metro, que transbordo por medio lleva al corazón de Manhattan (recomiendo adquirir por 30 dólares la tarjeta ilimitada de una semana. La playa esta a unos 300 metros (no sabia que había playa en Nueva York) Hay muchos deli y supermercados muy cerca.

Lastly ,the owner wasn’t there most of the time so if  you need anything you will have to make a phone call ."},{"_id":"348238775","date":{"$date":"2018-11-13T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7777283","reviewer_id":"60154415","reviewer_name":"Cathy","comments":"nice place to stay,  very near to mongkok.  william is very helpful and easy to communicate"},{"_id":"356729646","date":{"$date":"2018-12-09T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7777283","reviewer_id":"93757532","reviewer_name":"Jiao","comments":"位置不错"},{"_id":"358965667","date":{"$date":"2018-12-16T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7777283","reviewer_id":"116609922","reviewer_name":"Regab","comments":"比预想中要好很多!下次还会再来"},{"_id":"362290992","date":{"$date":"2018-12-26T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7777283","reviewer_id":"229398955","reviewer_name":"奇慧","comments":"住宿位置非常好离地铁非常近,去哪里都很方便｡下楼就很热闹,小吃､便利店什么都有｡房间很干净,每天都有来打扫｡房东一家人都很热情,问到景点会很热心地指给我;说有点感冒会告诉我要去喝一碗感冒茶;最后一天没带房卡要进房拿行李赶车,告知房东后立马打车过来给我们开门｡非常感谢!很愉快的体验,下次来香港还会住这里"}]}

Sehr schnell haben wir bemerkt, dass die Wohnung leider keine Waschmaschine hatte, obwohl diese im Profil angegeben war und für uns mit zwei Kleinkindern wichtig war. Manuel hat sich sofort angeboten öffentliche Waschsalons ausfindig zu machen und uns die Adressen zu nennen. Das hat er auch prompt getan und uns dazu noch einige andere Cafes, Restaurants und nette Plätze in der Umgebung genannt. Erfreulicherweise gab es eine besonders liebe Nachbarin im Hause, die sich angeboten hatte die Wäsche unserer Kinder zu waschen. Die Nachbarschaft war sehr kinderlieb und freundlich. Wir haben uns in dem Haus und in der Umgebung sehr wohl gefühlt. Die Wohnung war sauber und zweckmäßig. Der Garten war besonders für unsere Jungs ideal.\r\nAm Abreisetag mussten wir früh am Morgen los. Manuel war so freundlich und hat uns ein Taxi bestellt.

Luckily it was nothing but sunshine during our 5 days in this apartment. \n\nWe highly recommend this apartment and would stay at again over and over.

Nosotros éramos 3 personas, pueden dormir tranquilamente 4 personas, porque tiene una cama y un sofá cama. Es un segundo piso sin ascensor, en ningún momento notamos a los vecinos y las gaviotas nos hacían compañía (eso sí, lleva tapones si dormirás en el sofá cama y si tienes el sueño ligero porque hacen ruido jeje) sin embargo se callaban del todo a eso de las 00horas, nosotros dormimos muy pero muy bien. El propietario estuvo en contacto con nosotros durante toda la estancia, tiene un libro de sitios turísticos a recomendar, un libro de sugerencias, en el piso no está permitido fumar, y tenía colgado el resguardo que informaba que es un piso turístico autorizado, Sin duda alguna lo recomendamos al 100%.

Highly recommended if you are planning a budget travel and you know what typical apartments in Brooklyn/Queens are like."},{"_id":"180210763","date":{"$date":"2017-08-09T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7837816","reviewer_id":"121730910","reviewer_name":"Kilian","comments":"I liked the place as a good place to spend the nights.

If you will depend on the subway, ita a bit of a walk, maybe 15 minutes from the G train."},{"_id":"286543005","date":{"$date":"2018-07-06T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7837816","reviewer_id":"29961096","reviewer_name":"Minh","comments":"Edgar’s place is clean, tidy, and well kept.

No issue finding the home and check in was a breeze with a lock box check in system. We had no need for a tour from the owner as the house was simple and perfectly appointed. There were other homes nearby, but the house was very private. We did not see any direct neighbors during our 4 day stay. There were ample linens and towels which smelled beautifully fresh. The house was spotlessly clean. The bed was comfortable for two and the house was cool during the evening with just the use of a ceiling fan and small desk fan provided. The outdoor shower was a dream as the sun was rising or after a long day of exploring the island. Plenty of hot water for two to take a comfortable shower. There was a great washer/dryer set off the back of the house; pack less and wash in the comfort of your home. The kitchen has a 2 burner cook top, no oven, small fridge, and outdoor grill. A good amount of dishes and appliances for cooking. We did not cook at the house; there were so many great places to eat in the town of Pahoa just an easy and beautiful 20 minute drive away. We had no issue with bugs or mosquitos in or around the house. There were plenty of geckos to watch scurry about and a symphony of frogs to listen to each night. From time to time you can hear the ocean but cannot see it from the house. Beautiful landscaping which made it nice to just relax on the porch and watch the wind blow. There were coolers and snorkeling gear at the house available for use. Lava viewing, hot springs, night market and black sand beach are all an easy drive away. The people we met around the neighborhood were so nice. We stayed at this location and another much more reviewed, much more expensive, much more popular location with AirB\u0026B and the Zen Light house far exceeded our expectations.

And, the tap water is filtered, so no running to the public spigot near Kalapana for drinking water. Speaking of water - there’s also a great outdoor shower (a must-have in Hawaii). \n\nKeep in mind, this is a subdivision with several houses within eyesight and earshot — the host is not at fault, obviously. There will be noise from traffic and people, maybe even power tools such as leaf blowers — why these unnecessary implements are not banned in such a place, I have no clue.

I would definitely recommend Dins place for any family making a NYC trip and will be happy to go back when we visit again."},{"_id":"44991840","date":{"$date":"2015-08-30T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"7864877","reviewer_id":"11650589","reviewer_name":"Patricia","comments":"Dins really takes care of us, she did a lot to help  ( our situation was a little bit special as we move to NYC for one year).\r\nThe apartment is near the subway and a walk to central park so very convenient. Dins let us use the bicycles and Internet works really well.\r\nBig enough for a family 5 and the kitchen is well equiped. There is plenty of supermarket nearby.\r\nThe only thing that annoyed us a little bit is the cleaning because the floor of the apartment was dirty."}]}
