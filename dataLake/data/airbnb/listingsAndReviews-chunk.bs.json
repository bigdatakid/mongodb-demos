The Poipu Turtle Suite was beyond my expectation. Everything you need for a great time is provided. We had everything from boogie- boards and snorkel gear to insulated shopping bags and a garlic press! This 3000sqft home was immaculate and comfortable. It more than accommodated our party of 5 and the occasional visitors. All of the pictures accurately depict the home and views.  Turtle Suite is perfectly located adjacent to shopping, beaches, and points of interested. We used the garage at night, but the location is in a quiet safe neighborhood, so security was of no concern to us.\r\nJoshua went above his call of duty for us. He was easy to get a hold of and he answered all of my questions immediately and with the utmost of care (I asked A LOT of questions).  We ended up needing the house for a few hours longer on our departure date. Without hesitation, Joshua was able to grant our request. It really made our departure that much more convenient for us.\r\nI had a wonderful time on Kauai and at the Turtle Suite. I would love to visit more of Joshua's listings, I am sure they are as described.

It can certainly sleep a large family, an extended family group, or a group of adults easily. The kitchen was fully equipped for cooking and baking, and we could not find any piece of kitchen equipment that was not included. The beds and bedding in each room were very comfortable, and all in our party slept well each night. The towels provided were clean, soft and numerous enough to cover 3 adults \u0026 2 kids. Large beach towels were provided as well. WiFi and cable were provided, as was a Blu-Ray player with surround sound system. \r\nA pleasant surprise was that Poipu Beach is a great area for amateur snorkeling, without paying for an organized tour! Easy access to many local shops, restaurants, activities. \r\nA perfect fit for 3 adults \u0026 2 kids for a week. We will specifically look for the property for future bookings.

There were 7 of us total and the house had more than enough space and beds. Two families could easily share this rental and be happy and comfortable. The upstairs and downstairs of the house are almost separate 2bd/1ba units. It had been professionally cleaned prior to our arrival. There are boogie boards, snorkel gear and beach chairs in the garage, which was very useful for us. The kitchen is stocked with some basics and you're set up to run to the grocery store and make meals at the house, if you want. There are even gas and charcoal grills and outdoor picnic tables for your use, if you want them. We chose to do breakfast at home, then eat out for all lunches and dinners, since there's a lot to try on the island. The only downside is that the rental was fairly expensive, but since my family and I had a great time, in the end I think it was worth the cost.

It is literally across the street from Brenneke's beach and up a small short lane.  Poipu Beach and Brennekes were within walking distance and we walked to them everyday multiple times.  Other guests left chairs, umbrella, boogie boards and sand toys in the garage so we were able to use them at the beach.  There was so much space to spread out in the unit and relax.  There are actually three official bedrooms as listed but a fourth sleeping area/room with a double bed and a twin trundle underneath that can be partitioned off by an accordian (Website hidden by Airbnb) there are actual beds for ten with at least six futons that can be slept on as well.  There are two 'family rooms' with large HD televisions and a great kitchen space.  We had views of the ocean from both bedrooms upstairs as well as the upstairs and downstairs lanais.  Another review said that there was only one working shower downstairs but the upstairs shower works fine it just has a different way of turning the water from the faucet to the shower.  There is a ring around the opening of the faucet where the water comes out that you have to pull down to transfer water from tub to shower.  :)  There are two grills outside the garages with picnic tables on the grass.  We used the grill that was basically brand new (garages are a separate building from the home)  Be aware that the pool, hot tub, bball courts, workout space, pickleball courts are not right next to the property but down the road a mile...and it closes at 7.  That was a bit disappointing but the home was not.  Before you go to the store to buy seasonings and sauces check out the cupboard and drawer between the fridge and microwave...there are tons of them in the home to use.  There were tons of pots and pans, two toasters, a blender and coffee maker (we did not use this tho).  There was not any big bowl or glass baking dishes to use.  We have been burned several times by airbnb's before so were so pleased with this location.  You will be amazed at how large it is and the location is awesome.  I am very impressed by the speed of communication each time I had a question.  Check in and out were a breeze."},{"_id":"323099350","date":{"$date":"2018-09-14T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3270926","reviewer_id":"28291647","reviewer_name":"Helen","comments":"We were very happy with the Turtle Suite.

Overall, our stay was wonderful and we would certainly stay there again."},{"_id":"333078585","date":{"$date":"2018-10-06T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3270926","reviewer_id":"214329980","reviewer_name":"Dell","comments":"We enjoyed our stay so much we plan to book again for next year.

Stop at the Basilique Notre-Dame to admire its splendid stain-glass window (and for a moment of peace and quiet). Then head off to the historic Place Jacques-Cartier and settle down at one of its terraces, where you’ll get a great view street artists and portrait painters and where the sangria flows like water. - The Little-Italy, which is more steeped in tradition. You’ll always feel warmly welcomed. And the Jean-Talon market, one of the gems of the city, making it one of the city’s most valued areas. - The Village, a neighbourhood where you’ll never be bored.

We never met her and her partner in person because they were travelling while we rented the apartment, but they were very thorough in giving us all the information we needed beforehand, plus lots of extra tips for things to do in the area. The apartment itself is lovely, an ideal size for one person or a couple to stay, though we were able to fit a third person on a blow-up mattress in the living room without it feeling too crowded. Friendly neighbours, great cooking facilities, internet, etc. - we felt at home. Great location too, within an easy walking distance from a lot of the most fun parts of Brooklyn, and a quick ride on the L train into the heart of Manhattan. Next time I'm in New York I'll definitely be checking to see if the apartment is free again!"},{"_id":"3768091","date":{"$date":"2013-03-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"32969","reviewer_id":"4983431","reviewer_name":"Aaron","comments":"I had a wonderful stay at Katherine's apartment.

It was wonderful to have a functioning kitchen and goodies in the closet to take the beach. The general market was only a short drive away... We didn't even hit the pool because the beach was literally that close. But, note if you are looking for a beach to layout at - you might struggle as this is more a jump in over the rocks and snorkel. Only a small patch of sand. Otherwise within a few minutes drive you are at sandy beaches! Overall it was a wonderful experience! We would book again with Jack and Dorinda - no hesitation.

They will assist you if you need help or some cool tips where to go to, what to do in Rio.\r\n\r\nOf course, this is not the Hilton (thank God!): There may come a day when it´s a little loud (music in the house or some party in the favela), or when the kitchen may be a little all over the place - but this is temporary and makes it all feel even more like living together with friends instead of staying anonymously in one of the hotel towers in Copacabana.

Axel's casa is located in the beautiful Santa Teresa, with the most amazing views of Rio, day and night.  Axel is a wonderful host, particularly as I caused a few problems in arriving late and then being the victim of a robbery - Axel, unasked, loaned me money while I got myself sorted out, and was very caring.  His casa is only a hair-raising, death-defying 10 minute bus ride from the centre of Rio, so perfectly located.  The streets of Santa Teresa are beautiful, well worth walking around, and Axel's casa is within easy travelling distance of the tourist attractions of Cristo Redentor, Copacabana beach and all the city buildings.  Sadly, many of the buildings are closed for repair for World Cup 2014 and the Olympic Games 2016, but there is still plenty to see.\r\n\r\nA little warning: Axel is currently undertaking renovations at his casa, so you must be prepared for some building work to go on around you - but all the guys are really friendly.  If you need 5-star quiet, your own everything and cleanliness - Axel's is not the place.  If, however, you want to see the real Rio, live in a favela (safety is not a problem), have a wonderful host and meet lots of people of all different nationalities (there were 5 different languages being spoken a few nights ago!!), then you will love Axel's casa.  Thank you Axel for a wonderful 10 days - I think your casa is fantastic and it will be absolutely wonderful when you have finished your renovation.

The view from the apartment is even more beautiful than pictures. In addition, Axel allowed us to experience the real life of favelas. The apartment is ideally located for visiting Rio. Buses for center run every 10 minutes. Interaction and meetings with people passing by casa for a drink made the success of our stay.

We really enjoyed our stay with Axel, him and the other housemates are very friendly and helpful, the view from the house was amazing and the favela it's in is very safe. However, we were disappointed to find out upon arrival that there was a lot of building work going on. Axel said he was unable to tell us as the internet wasn't working two days prior to our arrival but I don't understand why we were not told around the time we made the booking, we exchanged several emails and it was never mentioned. There was quite a lot of work going on so I doubt they expected it all to be finished. The building work meant that we were unable to use the main floor of the property or enjoy the terrace (we were allowed but it wasn't that enjoyable being surrounded by building tools and with the sounds of drilling or hammering in the background). It would have been nice to have been warned in advance or even to have been offerd a slight discount as it probably wasn't worth full rate in that condition. Otherwise though, the house was great, I'm sure it will be amazing when all the work is done. Our room was lovely, We especially enjoyed the full length window in front of the shower in the ensuite with the view over the city. The kitchen was quite basic and I saw a few mice but we were able to cook just fine, and they had most appliances we needed. Some mornings Axel made us breakfast which was a lovely touch. I would recommend this property but I would urge you to check that there is no building work going on first as I'm not sure if we would have stayed if we had known."},{"_id":"8721238","date":{"$date":"2013-11-13T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"332150","reviewer_id":"9717224","reviewer_name":"Sonia","comments":"Hôte super accueillant, disponible et de très bon conseils pour les visites.

Une expérience où quand vous rentrerez chez vous, vous en parlerez pendant des heures à vos amis? En y postant sur (Hidden by Airbnb) des photos incroyables? Et bien vous ne serez pas déçu par la Casa 48, où j'y ai passé 5 nuits très agréables. Je ne suis absolument pas d'accord avec les commentaires négatifs précédents, c'est sûr qu'en venant en haut d'une favela à un tel prix, il ne faut pas s'attendre à avoir un petit déjeuner 4 étoiles, sinon aller au Copacabana Palace. Celui était très correct, tout comme les sanitaires et la cuisine fonctionnelle. La WiFi fonctionne même mieux que chez moi. J'y ai passé un séjour très agréable, les travaux étaient minimes, l'accueil était chaleureux et sincère, Axel m'a donné pleins de bons plans et m'a permis de vivre une expérience inoubliable à Rio, grâce à ses conseils. Il s'est montré très disponible et toujours de bonne humeur. En plus, on y rencontre d'autres touristes et locaux, on y partage ses expériences. La vue est splendide sur le Pain de Sucre, l'accès est simple, le quartier est vivant - c'est le vrai Rio, loin du côté superficiel qu'offre d'autres quartiers - bien situé (bus en bas de la favela, ensuite 15 min de copacabana). Une expérience à vivre absolument ici, en toute humilité et simplicité. Vous ne serez pas déçu. Obrigado axel !\r\n\r\nHello dear future hosts of the casa 48 (hopefully for you) , are you ready for a great carioca's experience? An experience where when you get home , you talk for hours to your friends? By posting amazing pictures on (Hidden by Airbnb) ? Well, you will not be disappointed by the Casa 48 , where I spent 5 nights very pleasant. I'm not absolutely agree with the previous negative reviews, it is certain that from the top of a favela at this price , don't expect to have a \"breakfast 4 stars\" , otherwise go at the \"Copacabana Palace\" ! . He was very correct, like bathroom and kitchen. WiFi works even better than my home. I spend nice holidays here, build was very minimal, the welcome was warm and sincere , Axel gave me a lot of goods plans and allowed me to live an unforgettable experience in Rio , thanks to his advice. He was very helpful and always cheerful . In addition , we meet other tourists and locals , there sharing his experiences. Great views of the Pao Acuçar, access is simple. This is the real Rio , away from the side surface offered other neighborhoods - location ( bus down the favela then 15 minutes from copacabana ) . Absolutely an experience here , in all humility and simplicity. You will not be disappointed.

As a Boomer, I was the oldest person in what I'd characterize as a youth hostel. If a hotel room cleaned by a maid, air conditioning, and personal privacy is your thing, Axel's casa probably isn't your gig.\r\n\r\nHowever, the young people there couldn't have been nicer. Six or seven of us strolled down the street to a terrific restaurant in the Santa Teresa neighborhood. I would never have gone there own my own. I also took the public bus downtown, truly an experience not to be missed.\r\n\r\nBut the highlight was Valentin and one of the guests taking me down the steep hill into the favela. I felt perfectly safe, but for travelers who are skittish about poor neighborhoods, this may not be your preference. \r\n\r\nAll in all, Axel's place is for hearty travelers who don't mind some inconveniences.

We arrived very late our first night and he was awake waiting for us and stated from the outset that 'this was our house too' which made it very easy for us to feel comfortable and at home which was lovely. \nThe area was buzzy and lively, a nice contrast to the overly busy Ramblas,  which was nice as we saw two seperate sides of Barcelona and felt less like tourists. It was also only a 10-15 minute walk to the Rambla so if you prefer the more touristy areas you are not far at all. \nWe would come and go from the house as we pleased and Alexis was very helpful giving tips on tapas bars and museums to go and see. He was very accommodating and even gave us clean fresh towels when we walked through the door one night soaked from the rain. \n\nOverall a really lovely guy and a really beautiful, modern, lovely house. \nThank you so much!

Il quartiere in cui è situata, El Raval, viene spesso descritto come pericoloso o roba del genere…durante la mia settimana di soggiorno nessuna di queste caratteristiche si è rivelata veritiera. E’ un quartiere tranquillo, particolare, multietnico, pieno di locali come Burger King, minimarket, Carrefour, forni e pasticcerie, macellerie, kebab, parrucchieri, e localini che fanno tapas, paella e altri piatti tipici. Alexis è una persona disponibilissima, sempre sorridente, sempre pronto a trovare una soluzione ai tuoi problemi. Ci ha accolto mostrandoci il piccolo soggiorno, la cucina attrezzatissima di qualsiasi comodità (piatti, bicchieri, pentole, posate, microonde, fornelli a induzione, frigorifero e freezer grandissimi, ecc.ecc.), il bagno e successivamente la nostra camera che si trovava al piano di sopra (dotata di aria condizionata, con la possibilità di poter chiudere la porta a chiave). La casa è piccolina ma accogliente, e Alexis fa di tutto per metterti a tuo agio e per farti sentire a casa tua (mi ripeteva sempre “feel home!!!”). Inoltre sa parlare bene l’inglese, oltre allo spagnolo.\nConsigliatissimo per chi vuole un appartamento centrale ed economico per trascorrere una vacanza a Barcellona."},{"_id":"344243441","date":{"$date":"2018-11-03T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3322110","reviewer_id":"130416565","reviewer_name":"Bingen","comments":"Convivencia sencilla y sin complicaciones.

Also, the big advantage is that the room is very sunny, but in the same time it doesn't get too hot because it is on the 12th floor and there is always a nice breeze. The building is centrally located, but in the same time not so touristy (which I loved). Just a couple of metro stops away are all major sights and sightseeing areas and there are cafes and restaurants within a block radius.

Many days before arriving, he gave us all the instructions to find our way from BCN airport to his place which is very easy by the way.\r\nHe welcomed us and gave us a quick lesson about where we were situated, and which directions to go to to find places of interest. There are small grocery stores not far away.\r\n\r\nHere are some pros and cons about the place.\r\n\r\nPros :\r\n- Location : Next to two metro stations, 5min walk to each. The area is safe at night.\r\n- The view : From the 12th floor, you have a wonderful view on top of the former plaza de toros and the rest of the city\r\n- Cleanliness : Everything was clean all around\r\n- Practicality : Each room has its dining set, which means you always have what you need to eat\r\n- The room : Just the right size, and there’s a ceiling fan which is very useful.\r\n- There's a cell phone shop down the building. If your cell phone is unlocked, you get good deals there for a SIM with data.\r\n\r\nCons :\r\n- Location : Being on the Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes (major axis in Barcelona) not far from Plaça de les Glories Catalanes means lots of trafic. So have your earplugs ready if you don’t tolerate noise.\r\n- The bed : The end-of-life foam mattress forms a curve when you lie on it.

Although the sun rises on the other side of the building, the sun rays creeping up on the arena and La Sagrada Familia to the right still makes for a great sunrise. Room is neat and set up nicely.  \n\nAdditional: Jóse has everything well organized. He does rent out 2 other rooms as well so to keep everything running smoothly he's put up simple instructions and rules that are pretty straightforward. Although we didn't have time for coffee and toast in the morning, I absolutely loved that these were made available. \n\nOverall: 10/5 stars.

The views of the Monumental Plaza de Toros and the Sagrada Familia are breathtaking, simply amazing! The apartment is perfectly organized down to the smallest detail, everything is set up for you to have a very pleasant stay -stuff to prepare your own breakfast included! José's hospitality makes you feel at home right away, communicationwith him was easy, fast and open. Tons of useful information were provided, everything was very well explained since the very first contact -including instructions on how to get to the apartment from different points in town. You can reach Sagrada Familia in under 15 minutes walking, or under 5 on a bike -which you can also rent from José at better prices than most places downtown. Biking around Barcelona is very safe and 100% recommended!

However, don't expect that you are going to stay at a luxury apartment. What one should know is that Jose's place is shared, consisting of 4 rooms, the kitchen is not sparkling clean, and the breakfast is the most simple thing, namely, butter, coffee, and marmalades. Jose has his rules, which anyone should obey and this may give a feeling of military! But it's necessary because there is a big bunch of people in one apartment. Everywhere, there are rules that tell you how to act! Another thing is that, if you arrive at Barcelona after 11, he will ask you to take a taxi, because he cannot wait for you till late, and you may have to pay about 35 euros from the airport to get to his apartment as soon as he desire. After all, if you have already decided to stay in his place, do not miss the opportunity of renting his bikes, Barcelona is one of the best cities to hang around with bike and his bikes are fairly cheap."},{"_id":"311970812","date":{"$date":"2018-08-22T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"333190","reviewer_id":"70444884","reviewer_name":"二萱Yixuan","comments":"首先地理位置很优越 距离圣家堂很近 交通也很便利\n\n其次房东人很细心,有一些要求也是为了大家都舒服｡\n\n整体而言还是挺不错的,不过由于我们入住的时候已经是8月下旬,天气很热｡之前看评价说12楼很凉快,但是我们入住的那三晚真的是热爆了｡窗户打开有点风,但是相当的吵,根本没法睡,关上的话又很热｡天花板上有个电风扇,我们试图找开关,发现疑似开关被拿胶带贴住了｡建议小伙伴们如果去的时候天气不热可以去住,或者不介意开窗吵的｡毕竟地理位置还是很不错的｡另外,洗澡有明确的时间,好像是7至晚11｡并非只有一个房间有租客,碰上租客全满的时候,要规划好游玩时间,避免回来太迟没有充足的时间洗澡｡"},{"_id":"313913892","date":{"$date":"2018-08-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"333190","reviewer_id":"210934626","reviewer_name":"Tim","comments":"We had a great stay!

It is a fantastic place to stay, not far away from the city (10 minutes drive) and with more convenient temperature than on the coast due to the 1200 ft elevation (still warm but about 10°F less).

Sylvia and Karen are great hosts. Sylvia is an amazing cook. I loved her humus, fresh juices, barbecue.... I discovered many great new recipes which I will bring to Europe! They invited me several times for lunch and diner, we often prepared our meals together or in their absence I could cook myself in their kitchen. I enjoyed our discussions while preparing the meals or enjoying a glass of well tempered red wine. \r\nSylvia and Karen also showed me many exceptional places which are not indicated in travel guides.

The house was easy to get to from the airport, in a quiet community with good access to many island destinations. There's even a fair-sized convenience store within walking distance. The property is gorgeous with an amazing view and a beautiful garden, full of different orchids and fruit trees.They've taken care to combine beautiful and unique elements throughout. The room was clean with a very comfortable bed. Good for one or two guests. The personal outdoor shower was not at all a nuisance for me. They've prepared some handy maps but were always willing to chat about other recommendations. They are a wealth of knowledge. Every morning outside the room was a mountain of fresh-picked fruit for breakfast, buttery avocados the size of small melons and delicious 100% Kona coffee. After a day of exploring I always looked forward to coming back and catching up with Karen and Sylvie. They have a contagious fun energy, throw gourmet dinner parties, eat cheese and drink good wine with my kind of enthusiasm.

This was my first time using airbnb and I was more than satisfied during my stay. My boyfriend and I spent 3 days at Sylvia's BEAUTIFUL home. Sylvia, Karen and Roseanne are such wonderful women to be around. We felt like family the entire stay. Sylvia was so kind and generous to have invited us to a homemade dinner. When we were unable to attend, she took the time to prepare brunch for us the morning before we left. The property is a short drive to downtown and the beaches. They even suggested places for us to visit and things for us to do in the area. The room was nice, comfortable, and clean. The outdoor shower makes you feel like you're showering in paradise.

The private outdoor shower is wonderful! Even though the room is on the lower level of the home, it gets lots of light. There is a full-time renter in an adjacent room (separate entrance), but I wasn't even aware of her being there.\r\n\r\nGorgeous gardens surround the house with fragrant flowers blooming everywhere and lots of trees. Sylvia has done a beautiful job with the landscaping. You will definitely enjoy the sweet smells of various flowers. Even though this is a residential area, it feels very private with all the trees. \r\n\r\nI lived in Kailua Kona for 2 years but had never visited this neighborhood. It's a great location, removed from the insanity of downtown but close enough to easily go back and forth. The home is located off of Kaiminani Drive, about 3 miles above the airport. This makes it easy to drive into downtown Kailua Kona (about 10 minutes without traffic), north to the best beaches, or up Mamalahoa Highway to access the Saddle Road and head over to Hilo.\r\n\r\nSylvia is such fun, a delightful woman with many interesting stories to share. She's also an amazing cook! If you are lucky enough to get an invitation for a meal, you MUST accept. It's such fun to share a meal and talk story. Both Sylvia and Karen have lots of information if this is your first time to the Big Island. If you prefer to be left alone, that's ok too. I'm a very private person but thoroughly enjoyed their company.\r\n\r\nI could go on and on. It's such a beautiful place, run by beautiful people. It made me feel like I was coming home. This place is a real bargain, one of the best I've found. I will definitely stay here again. Mahalo nui loa Sylvia and Karen. I am ever so grateful."},{"_id":"66832159","date":{"$date":"2016-03-25T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"333624","reviewer_id":"63034084","reviewer_name":"Ben","comments":"How does waking up to banana rolls and sweet cake (home made) sound for your first morning in Hawaii? Or a soft bed, with plenty of covers, pillows, and a memory foam pad for your first night? Add a sparkling clean room, fresh fruit and perfect hosts to top it off and you've found the essence of Hawaiian hospitality. I highly recommend the Balai Kona Tropical Paradise. Sylvia and Karen are the perfect hosts, quick to answer requests and open ears to hear about your day. Of the numerous hotels, apartments, inn's, etc, I've stayed at over the years, this is by far the very best.

There are a lot of cool artifacts that these ladies have collected throughout their adventures and that contribute to the ambiance. Sylvia’s garden is spectacular. The deck is really nice. They are both very skilled cooks; often times they spoiled us with fruits, exquisite meals, wine, bread pudding, and other goodies. All of which pales to their company. \n\nSylvia works at a tour company and therefore knows a lot about excursions offered on the island.

The upper floor actually consists of two smaller flats, each with a bathroom but only one containing the kitchen. This situation was positive in some ways, and if we had any issue with the separate keys (as sometimes we'd split up), Cesim was able to help us with access.\n\nThe beds were of a good standard, though one of them (next to the kitchen area) was subject to direct sunlight because there was no curtain there. However, as we were visiting in winter there was darkness throughout the times we wanted to sleep. The bathrooms are a good size, especially in Room 8.  The kitchen was adequate and there is a shop directly opposite where anything we needed was readily available.\n\nThe location is ideal as a launchpad for the Sultanahmet area and there are some decent and affordable cafes/restaurants on the same street. You should keep in mind that the street can be fairly noisy in the morning, and the other side can be noisy for other reasons (such as birds!). If you're a heavy sleeper then you'll have no problem.\n\nOverall I was very pleased with the apartment and especially with Cesim's kind welcome and his help when I faced a few personal difficulties.

The location is great, especially if you want to spend time both in the south (at the famous beaches and Lagoa) and further north in the city centre seeing some of the cultural bits, as Botafogo is mid-way between them. In fact we did lots of walking (as far afield as the Jardim Botanico and to Urca for the Sugar Loaf cable car) and relied on the nearby Metro for our transport needs.\r\n\r\nThe apartment was clean, modern, safe and had all the facilities we needed including a great big fridge/freezer, coffee percolator, washing machine, huge wet-room style shower, wireless internet, and effective air conditioning which was especially welcome.  I'd agree about the noise of the 11 lanes of traffic, but the earplugs we brought with us meant we weren't disturbed.\r\n\r\nAna's list of local suggestions of shops, restaurants etc was a big help.  Highlights of our trip included a day trip by ferry to Niteroi, an afternoon at the brilliant exhibitions in the Paço Imperial, cycling round the Lagoa, a swish lunch at Confeitaria Colombo in town, the Saturday antiques market at Praça XV de Novembro (much better than the Sunday craft fair at Ipanema General Osorio) and of course plenty of relaxation with agua de coco and caipirinhas at Copacabana and Ipanema!\r\n\r\nIf we go back to Rio (which I hope we will) I'd be very happy to stay at Ana's place again."},{"_id":"3537713","date":{"$date":"2013-02-14T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"336569","reviewer_id":"3684434","reviewer_name":"Angela Maria","comments":"Me encanto el apartamento, realmente una vista magnífica al pao de acucar!

It's also close to banks and a 3-minute walk to the Botafogo Praia Shopping.  \r\nIt's about a 5-10 minute walk to the subway, there is a bus stop nearby, and there are cabs driving by all the time (to get an idea there are 33,000+ cabs in Rio which is more than twice the number of cabs in NYC).\r\n\r\nAssistance:\r\nI had a few questions while I was there and Ana always responded promptly and ready to help.   Laura (the assistant that met with us to turn in the keys) was very nice and always on time - for getting us the key she was in the apartment at least 30 minutes earlier, and to turn in the apartment she was 10 minutes early. \r\n\r\nOverall, I strongly recommend to anyone that wants to visit Rio!\r\n\r\n"},{"_id":"26816434","date":{"$date":"2015-02-20T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"336569","reviewer_id":"24400038","reviewer_name":"Shamini","comments":"Host was very welcoming.

No banheiro não havia luz e na sala também não. \nAs paredes do quarto maior estavam muito sujas, não dava vontade de encostar na parede pra dormir. O colchão de casal estava manchado, amarelado. O mesmo aconteceu com os travesseiros. \nVárias tomadas estavam folgadas e não conectavam direito. \nMas o ponto alto do descontentamento foi a máquina de lavar. No anúncio consta a possibilidade de lavar roupas, o que se torna um grande atrativo para um grupo de 5 pessoas. Mas a máquina estava suja, completamente preta por dentro. Havia resto de sabão e água. \nFiquei bastante surpresa com estes problemas pois não havia nenhuma reclamação deste tipo nas avaliações. O apartamento precisa de limpeza e de algumas reformas."}]}

You can't walk a single block without seeing large, incredible murals on varying building walls and facades. It hosts frequent pop-up shopping, food trucks, and events. Also my apartment is in the heart of Williamsburg (yet you would never know, as it's so quiet inside the apt!). Dozens of restaurants, boutiques, coffee shops, and the like are found just blocks away from the apt. Some of my favorite spots for coffee are Blind Barber and House of Small Wonders (try the cappuccino!). For a bite we recommend Meadowsweet and Reynard, within easy walking distance. McCarren Park is another can't miss with great open green space and a view on the real Williamsburg.","notes":"Please note: if you would like a later checkout to be guaranteed after 10am, please book an additional night to ensure there are no conflicts with the arrival of other guests. ** Additionally - if you are staying more than 7 nights, a small additional cleaning fee will be added to your booking ($40) to cover additional laundry and cleaning services. - NYC mandated recycling city wide.

When we first arrived, he insisted on making sure our rooms were all nicely prepped up (even though we were not very particular about it). So what we got was a nice, clean and comfortable room, with fresh linen and towels. Definitely made our day especially after our long and tiring journey. :)\r\n\r\nHe also shared with us excellent dining suggestions! This guy definitely knows his town really well, therefore rest assured you won't feel out of place living there. On that note, Richard's unit is in a pleasant quiet neighbourhood, not far away from Williamsburg where all the alternative New York actions are at. You have to check this area out before it becomes overly commercialised soon. It is just 2 mins walk to Halsey St station, and less than 30 mins to reach the main touristy places. Highly accessible!\r\n\r\nOn our last day, we made a mistake of not informing him in advance about our check out plans. It was embarrassing, but Richard and his visiting mom were patient and nice enough to shift and neatly arrange our belongings at the common room, without making a fuss about it. We really appreciate their kind gesture. \r\n\r\nRichard has a cat name Lucy who is absolutely adorable! Lucy would sneak into our room in the morning, probably to wish us good morning. She also ran to us before we left, probably to bid us farewell. If you love cats, you'd love Lucy! We are missing Lucy right now.\r\n\r\nIn summary, Richard's place is perfect, if you are looking for a comfortable stay at a neat, tastefully furnished room at an interesting part of town not far away from Brooklyn and Manhattan. Richard does design fyi and that explains why his home is so handsome. Richard is a great host too who is very respectful of your space and needs. You won't feel awkward having him as a host. We only wished we could see and talk to him more (understand that he was quite busy with work on the weekend we were there).\r\n\r\nThe city needs more AirBnb hosts like him. We highly recommend his and his place for your next stay in Brooklyn, NYC.

Only downside was that some of my bedsheets were not very clean, but this was solved when I found others in the cupboard.

O quarto/apartamento é maravilhoso. Parecia que eu estava em casa. É bem aparelhado e tinha tudo que necessitávamos. A cama é ótima com lençóis e toalhas fornecidas pelo Kip. O apartamento fica há 3 minutos do trem, e são mais 20 minutos para estar na Union Square. É muito fácil de chegar e sair de lá. Fica fácil de chegar lá de trem vindo do JFK. O bairo é tranquilo e residencial, tendo restaurantes e mercados bem próximo. Recomendo muito o lugar. O Kip é super gente fina. nos recebeu muito bem e nos ajudou em tudo o que precisávamos.

Good shower. Spotless. In terms of location, the apartment itself is located a block away from the station. Super convenient and accessible. The only thing I would point out is that for me, particularly, it seemed a bit far from Manhattan, but this is up to your sense of relatively. About the neighborhood, I didn't get a chance to explore; at late hours it seemed a bit on the rougher side but take into consideration that I basically only came to the apartment to sleep at pretty late hours. Loved the graffiti that's on the way to the station though.

He was fast with responses, picked us up at Taksim to take us to the house (which was really appreciated because he lives at the top of a steep hill), and was generous with his suggestions/recommendations. We visited at least three restaurants on his recommendation (loved them all). \r\n\r\nThe house itself is wonderful to stay in. It is petit, but plenty of space for two people. The views from the deck and living room windows are amazing! Of course, you have to earn this view by climbing the hill! This was not bad, but do be prepared for a 10 min hilly walk from the closest bus stop. The view and house is worth it. Ercan has three dogs and they stay in the \"compound\", but not the house itself. The dogs are friendly and lovable. \r\n\r\nThe location in Arnavutkoy is wonderful.

The place is not for from the shore where the center of the town is, so not much walk but the sharp uphills might be challenging to some. However if you hire a cap no problem at all, they all come up and drop you off in front of the house. The taxi prices are not expensive. We, personally, took the cap only once during our one week stay, other times enjoyed walking among old Turkish stile houses and absorbing the superb view glaring under a beautiful sun."}]}

The view from our room was fantastic, and Jade went out of his way to make sure we were comfortable. The self-serve continental breakfast has everything you'd need, which was great for us early-risers. A quick, full breakfast was welcome and allowed us to be on our way and enjoy the adventures that side of the Big Island had to offer.\r\n\r\nThe room is cozy and outfitted with fast WiFi, a television, a mini fridge and microwave, a coffee maker, and had a private bathroom. The only minor issue I had was that the water pressure in the shower was pretty weak. It's not a huge deal, but it's something to note. Also very minor, and not really an issue for most, but if you ARE allergic, there is a cat there. Snowball's very friendly, but it's just another thing to note.\r\n\r\nAll in all, this is a great place to stay, and Jade has the place outfitted such that you'll have everything you need. Need fresh towels? No problem. Want a glass or a bottle of wine? Just ask and you can buy one for a very fair price. All of this, and I didn't even mention that the first floor of the house has a common room with a large screen TV and full-sized pool table! Very cool.\r\n\r\nI'd absolutely stay with Jade again.

I really wish I did not book this place. Although \"checking in\" and parking was a breeze, the room itself was the equivalent of a cheap motel except it was half the size. The towels seem to all be air dried or something because they were rock hard and crunchy to use. The bed was uncomfortable and squeaky. I woke up itchy all over and discovered a squished bug that I could not identify on my legs accompanied with dozens of bites. They were not mosquito bites but rather some sort of mysterious bed bug. The room was covered in ants and the fan was far more noisy than helpful, even with ear plugs I could hear the old fan struggling to work. There is no kitchen at all which makes eating in impossible even when a tiny fridge and microwave is available. I was excited to get out of the place in the morning. It was purely a dark and gloomy old home with an old 1950s vibe motel on the second floor with a good view to make up for it."},{"_id":"109016249","date":{"$date":"2016-10-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"342139","reviewer_id":"34371651","reviewer_name":"Eva","comments":"This is not a very comfortable place to spend a night. The room is in very poor condition, as is the bathroom. The towels were absolutely gross-- super stiff, and rough. The pillows were barely there, they provided no support. The bed is old and the spring mattress is ridiculously uncomfortable. The smell in the room was very unpleasant. The temperature in the room was way too hot, and the fan that was provided was not adequate. The mini refrigerator was not turned on when we arrived, so all the drinks we wanted to drink that night were too warm. There are ants in the room, as is expected in Hawaii. The only positive thing about this room was the location.

It felt similar to staying in a hotel room with coded door locks, single serve coffee machine, laminated house rules posting, ID check in procedure. I think our room was the smallest, which made it tough to manage several suitcases. The private bathroom was nice and clean, and small. Our room had no A/C and a loud fan. A newer fan would have been nice. Location is great, only about a 5 minute drive to downtown Hilo and nice views from the hilltop. The best part of our stay was meeting the host.

They were also generous and flexible with our schedules and graciously shared the apartment's amenities such as the washer/dryer and dishwasher. We can't thank Melanie \u0026 Alex enough for the experience of having our own, quiet and homey, pied-à-terre while visiting Montréal. We felt like welcome guests rather than clients.\n\nMelanie's apartment is charming and has an excellent view of the city and the Plateau from the relaxing rooftop garden, which is a delicious bit of private luxury before or after a day out in the city. It's close to streets that conveniently connect to nearby East \u0026 West neighborhoods via rue Mont-Royale and rue Sherbrooke. (A Bixi bike station off Mont-Royale is likewise convenient.) Yet it's in a small quartier that also has restaurants, grocers, shopping and nightlife in it's own right, and is conveniently near green areas, such as Parc La Fontaine, Picine Laurier, the Olympic Park, and the parks on Île St. Hélèn via la Pont Jacques Cartier, which one can walk or bike across. (The view of the St. Lawrence \u0026 the city from this bridge is worth it alone.)\n\nIn short Melanie's apartment is wonderful and in a perfect location to experience the best of Montréal. \n\nI hope you also get to experience the good life from this perspective! \n\nThank you again, Melanie and Alex!

The roof deck is phenomenal, and in my opinion, is what sets this listing apart. You will certainly want to spend your evenings out there, and if you like to cook, plan to have some dinners up there too! We also didn't have any issue finding parking around the corner, which was a plus. Two recommendations - Le Pegase is around the corner and is BYOB, and Les Co'Pains d'Abord has phenomenal croissants in the morning for breakfast.\r\n\r\nOne caveat, as others mentioned, is that the apartment is not air conditioned. This is not that big of a deal during the day, but the bedroom does not have a portable AC unit either, and that made sleeping quite difficult all three nights. The only way that we could sleep was with the windows wide open, but that let all the light and noise from busy Ave Papineau into the room, and it was still pretty hot at that. The second bedroom is dark but has no windows to open and thus was too hot. We also only had one fan, which did not serve to cool down the room enough. I imagine that this is not an issue in the fall and spring, which are probably the best times to rent this apartment since you will still be able to use the roof deck but will also be able to keep the windows closed at night. Also please note that when we were there it was swelteringly hot, with nights in the upper 70s and high humidity. I imagine that cool summer nights may not be too bad either. We did know about the lack of AC when we rented the apartment, so it wasn't like Melanie was not honest, but if you don't like humidity or light/noise when you sleep, you may want to wait until the fall or spring to book this place."},{"_id":"95649821","date":{"$date":"2016-08-20T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3446689","reviewer_id":"43603571","reviewer_name":"Jean","comments":"Une très belle adresse et un appartement tres mignon"},{"_id":"99386165","date":{"$date":"2016-09-04T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3446689","reviewer_id":"3251493","reviewer_name":"Kristin","comments":"We did not get to meet Melanie, but her apartment was awesome and in a great location.

The rooftop patio is very cool as well. Those who might not like stairs too much may have a hard time, but the location and features were great!\n\nLots of restaurants, shops and boulangeries are nearby. Mont Royal metro station is \u003c10 min walk away, or a few mins by bus. \n\nMelanie was amazing - she offered lots of helpful info and advice for our stay and trip. She was very communicative and quick to respond to any of our inquiries. Thanks for a lovely stay, Melanie!

Just one minute from Prince Edward Station to this place as the owner mentioned. \n\nThe owner is superb. Lulu and Simon are great. They can help you anytime as you want. Because of my schedule was changed, they still could solve my problem. Outstanding!!!!! \n\nRestaurants and grocery shops are nearby. So, it is very easy to find some food when you get room late.

We found a small fish market a few meters away from the cathedral that sold also the best fruit at rock bottom prices (about one third of the price charged by the stores near the river). The metro station is near although the steps make it feel a bit farther than what it is. You can walk to Vila Nova de Gaia (for the Porto tasting) and to Porto town itself.

Merci à nos hôtes Claudia et Mafalda. Un appartement ultra propre, fonctionnel et décoré sobrement. Le rêve du fait de sa situation (quartier dans la Riviera classé par l'UNESCO) et du panorama qu'il offre jour et nuit. Rien à dire  sauf que cette situation exceptionnelle se rejoint en quelques minutes ( de la  Cathédrale ou du Douro ) uniquement  par des ruelles en escaliers de pierre donc pas d'enfant en bas âge ( sauf si vous le portez), ni d'handicap physique à la  marche.

Cláudia and Helena could not have done more for us. They waited patiently for us to arrive and led us to the apartment while helping with our suitcases.

The apartment is very warm and cozy, and both the bed and the couch are very comfortable. The location of the apartment is very convenient to the subway, and also centrally located within easy walking distance of many excellent neighborhoods. The most enjoyable part of my trip though was spending time in this beautiful apartment, reading a few of the many wonderful books in Ala's collection, and listening to her amazing record collection. She was a very pleasant and inviting host, and was there to meet me when I arrived at the apartment. She was kind enough to allow me a late checkout, and left behind plenty of soft towels and yummy espresso.

The hot and cold water was a little sketchy and it was a little dusty  but could overlook these as \"quirks\" or \"charm\" of an old apartment. On our 4th night out of 6 nights the only A/C unit, which is in the bedroom stopped working. Thankfully, there was a fan, but that was not enough to keep an apartment even slightly cool in July, basically just blew the warm air around. When I communicated this issue to the host that morning, she quickly responded, but we were questioned about how we were using it when we hadn't even touched it and told it \"just needed a break\" (even though that's not how air conditioning works...) we gave it a chance and kept it off during that day and it of course didn't work and when I told the host it didn't work she responded that she would have someone look at it after our stay. Therefore, we had two more nights of a very hot apartment and uncomfortable sleeping. Location was also a little far from a lot of the attractions of NYC, it is close to the subway but was quite a few stops from a lot of places. Overall, ok but wouldn't stay there again.

Ala was super kind and answered really fast. The self check-in was really easy.\n\nThe only negative points I could think of was that it is really noisy and hot.

First I was stranded due to my previous house from a friend ( who moved out  10 days before I got to Maui) that I had reserved last year.  Carol St. John even gave me the 1st floor 2 bedroom \"model\" the first night, as everything was booked, and then helped me move to my second story b n b.  As I was in Honolulu for a week before that and it rained every day for my herb seminar, I was glad to get to Maui for some r \u0026 r.   The washer had to have repairs after I started it up, so she and a friend even moved my wash to a different one and finished doing it and hung it in my upstairs b n b!!!   She gave me hints on beaches, let me use beach chairs, beach towels, bamboo mats to put your towels on the beach,  and ice in the freezer to take to the beaches. She helped me move out the last day and I was very pleased with the studio bnb with fans, air conditioning ( that I didn't need) with the cooling off at night, and enjoyed the huge rock wall shower, outdoor pools, with outdoor showers, bbq cooking stations, gazebo to silt in, off street parking,  floor to ceiling windows w/screens to enjoy the ocean breezes.  Also, only 2 blocks away was the church I walked to on Sunday morning.

Carole. Was so easy easy going and extremely helpful. The condo is in a gorgeous complex and so close to Front street (where the action happens in Lahaina).

It is walking distance to downtown, full of restaurants, shops, galleries and the waterfront pier where many activities take place and where the tour boats leave from for whale watching, snorkeling, etc. . The condo itself was OK, with nicely updated kitchen and bathrooms. The kitchen was well appointed with blender and coffeemaker. It is smaller than it looks in the pictures, and we had a full house, so it felt crowded with 6 adults. It doesn't have anywhere to eat except the bar with only two stools. The refrigerator is extremely small, so if you plan to cook or eat in a lot to save money ( as did our group) that might be a consideration. Parking is not allowed at the condo itself unless you pay $15/day for a separate permit. We had great difficulty finding street parking especially at night, so you might want to plan to get the parking permit if you go at  popular time of year, as we did.  Also, our particular ground level condo was right on the parking lot, with full glass walls and only venetian blinds, so we had headlights shining directly into our bedrooms in the middle of the night, and noisy teenagers coming and going in the parking lot at all hours only a few feet away. Another location in the same complex might have been fine. \r\nCarol was very nice and very responsive as the host.  I would recommend her as a host.

It's located at the back of the complex.  Pros: on the end, very quiet and near the pool.  Cons: view is of the parking lot and the highway (behind a lava rock wall, so not too bad).  The condo was clean, well equipped, and comfortable.  The location is great: easy walk to town, short drive to the beaches and hikes we wanted to explore.  We never met Carol.  She left a message asking if we arrived and if we had any questions, we called to confirm that things were fine.  Our only problem with the condo occurred because our bags did not arrive with us and the airline had to drop off later.  We were told by the front desk that they would not accept our bags because we weren't staying through them, so we had to wait around for our bags.  That was fair, but not really in the aloha spirit.  Otherwise we had a great trip and enjoyed staying at the condo."},{"_id":"3684495","date":{"$date":"2013-03-04T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"347803","reviewer_id":"4725263","reviewer_name":"Tanya","comments":"Location was awesome, so close to Front St. where all the shops are.\r\nUnit was very cozy and comfortable!

The location is perfect - walking distance to many activities, restaurants, and shopping.  I was a little worried that Lahaina would be too busy but it was perfect for this trip.  We did not actually stay in unit A203 because of a water leak right before our arrival so Carol moved us to I201 - I think they are essentially identical.    There were 2 bedrooms with king sized beds and a pull-out sleeper sofa.  Everything worked and the unit was clean.  It is great to have a washer/dryer in the unit.  My only complaint was that all the AC units are on timers with 4 hours maximum so we would wake up in the middle of the night to turn them back on (it was unusually hot and humid when we were there).\r\n\r\nThe onsite pools are nice and there are BBQs by the pools that were never all being used.  The larger pool has a lovely covered lounge area with tables and couches to relax on out of the sun. \r\n\r\nWe also rented C104 at the same time and the only difference is that unit had 1 queen and 1 king + sleeper sofa.  The decor in C104 was a little nicer and the AC units didn't shut off in the middle of the night. \r\n\r\nCarol answered every question that we had and was very helpful!

This is a large resort right in downtown Lahaina with those benefits described by previous reviewers. We particularly appreciated being able to walk to catch an excursion ride at the harbor or eat at one of the many excellent restaurants in the area. We very much enjoyed our time at Baby Beach and other beaches that are walkable. We especially appreciated Carol's quick response to any issue we had that came up. There are a couple of situations that people should be aware of. Carol seems to manage a number of properties and you should be aware of that the photos are generic. It is necessary to communicate exactly what you are renting. The community property at this resort seems to be managed by one company but there are a number of rental platforms including Airbnb that are utilized by the owners to rent out their units. There's a little bit of infighting that seems to be going on between these various companies. For example the pools all say that wristbands are required to use the pools. Airbnb did not provide us with wristbands but no one ever asked us for our wrist bands. As another example one would think that an owner would have an assigned parking space that you are then renting as part of the unit. However the manager for the property collects a $20 per day parking fee. So there is a little bit of expense and quirkiness going on but nothing that prevents you from having a wonderful time in this ideal part of the world."},{"_id":"362649876","date":{"$date":"2018-12-26T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"347803","reviewer_id":"195819321","reviewer_name":"Anand","comments":"Clear and professional response."},{"_id":"366990046","date":{"$date":"2019-01-03T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"347803","reviewer_id":"196946776","reviewer_name":"Kevin","comments":"If you are paying 2* value, then i would suggest this place.

The floors were just gross, sticky and old.  The toilets take 2 mins minimum to flush, The furniture was just old and cracked and in some spots ready to fall apart.  It was advertised that there is a pull out couch and the accommodation is suited for 6 people but this couch is probably 15 years old so it is almost falling apart.  the kitchen appliances are nearly ready to be replaced at best, the dishwasher leaks and is rusted beyond anything inside, \nI believe the pictures as advertised are from 10 years ago at best.  its just an old run down place that needs some extensive renovation and furniture replacement.  Carol seemed like a pleasant lady but I would not suggest this units unless the price is completely ridiculous cheap and you don't care about the accommodations.

He lives next door in a detached house and was always happy to help us, provided spare toilet paper when we ran out, etc.  Originally, I was concerned about the proximity of the two houses as my fiancee and I wanted a private place to unwind for a few days after a hectic trip, and we didn't want to be bothered.  Totally needless worry as Aral probably guessed our intentions and played it cool =).\r\n\r\nThe house itself was fantastic and the photos don't do it justice.  It looks like a cabin on the outside, but actually it's a complete and newly renovated home with a washer, dishwasher, full bath, good wifi, brand new windows and bathtub with water jets.  Lacks an oven/range as well as a dryer, but there's a big George Foreman-style grill that you can use.  Beautiful wood cabinetry and floors everywhere, and there's even a real live tree growing in the middle of the house.  (In case you're concerned, there weren't any bugs.)\r\n\r\nThe location was also great for us, far away from the island's town center and way uphill in a completely residential area with no foreigners.  Buyukada has become overrun tourists in the past decade or two, but Aral's place is completely isolated from that.  I'd say it's a 10-15 minute walk downhill to the town center.  I think that you can use one of the ubiquitous horse-drawn carriages, but we love walking so we went by foot.\r\n\r\nOne more comment regarding the first photo that's visible on the listing as of 9/15/2014.  The photo is kind of weird and makes the house appear as if it's not detached.  I want to assure you that the building is totally separate, and to the left of the house toward the back (not visible in the photo) is the backyard of the neighboring house that Aral lives in.  There are very effective shutters for all the windows.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for privacy and a getaway from hectic Istanbul, rest assured, look no further."},{"_id":"32645591","date":{"$date":"2015-05-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3494585","reviewer_id":"33271371","reviewer_name":"Umut Çağın","comments":"Aral, the owner of the house, is a good host who welcomed us nicely. He is so kind and helpful person who solved some of our requests rapidly. The conditions of the house are fair enough to stay for few nights. However, it is hard to take shower because of lacking the shower curtain. If you have problems of climbing the hills, it won’t be so nice for you to reach the house. It is written that there are 3 couches but one of the couch is not so comfortable. (Just for 1 or 2 nights, it is ok) Also, the cleaning of the house could be better. (I say this because of the dust on the carpet. We passed the night with windows opened and there was no problem at all) the comparison of the price over quality is fair enough.

It is warm and cosy and perfect for getaways. The house is on a hill so be ready to walk a 20 min hike to get there. The island does not have taxis nor cars, it functions on horses and electrical bikes and regular bikes. You can ask locals to drop you off if yoy have luggage and they are helpful. \n\nAral is a great host, the house was ready and clean, he was there to help with any questions. \n\nThe garden I think would be better taken care of in the summer since I visited in Winter time. The island is nice and detached. Everything closes at 8:30 pm (cafes, resto, shops) not a very touristic place to be for a week or so, but defenitely a great spot to clear your mind and have some quality quiet time. \n\nLoved it!"}]}

He was there to greet me promptly when the elevator doors opened to his floor and had already notated the Wi-Fi password expecting it would be the first thing I’d ask for (works great by the way). I was able to easily get in and out of the apartment during my visit. The last day he personally assisted me when I was having problems with the taxi service. For me personally, it was an even better trip because I chose Marcio’s place.

I cannot believe someone would do such a thing. \nAfter a lot of research, I had booked her place. We corresponded for a few days and each time she wasn't very friendly but I remained courteous. She asked for a lot of details, including my girlfriend's website info etc., because she didn't seem to trust us. She remained suspicious, writing on Airbnb and (Hidden by Airbnb) in the middle of the night, asking how I managed to get her phone number (apparently she isn't aware that Airbnb shares contact details once the booking is made). She was also very slow with her responses, except when she required a response from us. \nHer friend was supposed to help with the check in, but she hadn't shared her friend's number even on the day of check-in. Finally fed up, I asked her for her friend's number, since \"we cannot wait to get a response from you every time\". She then responded telling me to talk politely, to which I basically said \"I can say the same to you.\"\nAnd guess what? She immediately cancelled our reservation - because she did not like my response - regardless of the fact that we were a couple of hours from checking in! Diğdem seems to be under the impression that she is doing her guests a favour by letting them stay at her place, but this is not Couchsurfing. I don't understand how she can be so unfriendly to people but expect them to respond in an ever-polite, grateful manner.

A true panoramic view of the Bosphorus and Topkapi, the Blue Mosque, etc... and you see it from sunrise to sunset.  The south facing floor to ceiling windows slide open and the west facing bamk of windows open to provide a nice cross breeze (but it's nice there's an ac unit as the sun heats up this top-floor room).\n\nAnd Ali is a wonderful host.  He made check-in rather quick and was very available when needed.  (The elevator didn't work one morning and upon telling Ali this he hopped on the phone and we arrived back to the flat after lunch to a working lift.)\n\nAnd the location is fantastic.  There are several nearby restaurants and cafes and attractions...and it's a great jumping-off point for those who like to walk.  That said, it's difficult to find if you don't know the area, but once there it's easy to arrive at.

Great communication and always available since he typically works out of an office adjacent to the flat. The view from the penthouse apartment was incredible. The location is also prime as you can easily walk (10 min or less) to all the restaurants, cafes and shopping on Istiklal and Karakoy (port/down by the water). It is at the same time a quite residential area. Also if your up to it, walking to Old Town isn’t terrible and takes about 40 minutes across the Galata Bridge.  While we never used the kitchen, you could easily make breakfast or sandwiches as there are electric kettles, pans, cooktops and dish sets. Very enjoyable and a great value. Will stay with Ali the next time we visit Istanbul. Also, if you are just thinking about a Turkish holiday my advice is to do it. Amazing ancient sites, museums, food and people.

The tram (which is very cheap) is also near and the metro so it couldn’t be easier. Lots of restaurants nearby and thanks to Ali we would recommend the terrace at the top of the Radisson Blu Hotel, which is also in easy walking distance . This was a great stay made even better by a welcoming and hospitable host. Thank you so much Ali!"},{"_id":"412678354","date":{"$date":"2019-02-16T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3517150","reviewer_id":"39199970","reviewer_name":"Nicola","comments":"This apartment is the perfect base for exploring Istanbul! It was clean and comfortable, and the view was absolutely amazing - waking up in the morning to the sunrise over the Bosphorus is a great way to start the day! The bed was comfortable, and no loud noise at night. Ali was an excellent host, check in was quick and simple, and he was very responsive to all our communications. \nRegarding directions If you are taking the metro from the airport - make sure you look for the Istikal Cadessi exit as soon as you get off the train (don't just pick any exit!). It is a straightforward walk down the hill if you get the right one:)"}]}

The neon-bathed historic streets that wind through one of the densest parts of the world are worth visiting.

Conveniently, these are where a cluster of merchants sell one type of product on a single street. Mong Kok has entire streets and street sections dedicated to the sale of goldfish, flowers, birds, sneakers, and kitchenware. ･Sai Yeung Choi Street sells electronics, cosmetics and clothes. ･Shantung Street and Dundas Street are where you can pick up the latest Japanese and Western fashion and accessories. ･Langham Place is one of the many malls where you can do your Mong Kok shopping in air-conditioned comfort.","notes":"","transit":"The nearest railway station is Mongkok station (3 mins walk).

The apartment is set in a great area of Barcelona with nice people around, 24h supermarkets and nice bars! It is in between the center and the beach - which was perfect to reach everything the city has to offer!

The location is excellent, very central had shopping mall, restaurants, cafes and small shops around. Wish we could stay longer in Barcelona but we were there for 2 days only prior to our cruise. Would recommend this place to anyone looking for a good value."},{"_id":"254547589","date":{"$date":"2018-04-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"35379","reviewer_id":"55934473","reviewer_name":"Bayron","comments":"Es un lugar muy bien ubicado, cerca del metro, muy seguro."},{"_id":"255052046","date":{"$date":"2018-04-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"35379","reviewer_id":"171878894","reviewer_name":"Ingrid","comments":"Pablo é um excelente anfitrião, super gente boa e solícito.

A tragedy happen  to me at the Barcelona nord bus station.I turned my back to my rucksack and it was stolen.I tried to find the thief but I couldn’t get a sight of my bag.My I pad was in the bag and my sleeping bag and my clothings.I went to the police and they told me that there are 22 stealing cases a day in the Barcelona nord station.They couldn’t do anything about it or bother to let me lodge a report.There are security cameras but the police said they couldn’t get to view it because it is a station property.I wonder how true is that statement from a police saying that they are denied access to public security camera when a victim is reporting a crime that the camera has recorded.And the security Guards in the station wouldn’t let me view it,asking me to go to the police instead.All this seems so odd.Beware of Barcelona nord.There are homeless and illegal immigrants loitering in it.A safe station will not allow these people to be inside especially non tickets holders.In London they could only gather outside the station.When the Barcelona nord security allow it,I wonder if these homeless and immigrants and drug addicts were made by syndicate to commit crimes.Last autumn I arrived into Barcelona nord in the early morning from France and I saw scuffles where plain clothes police were kicking and beating up a chap claiming that the chap was caught stealing.This happens while a security guard from the station was watching and chatting with the plain clothes police.Was the chap a thief or was he prevented from leaving the station?I wouldn’t trust the police there.Barcelona is a crime infested city and high in corruption and drugs.There are beautiful houses and park designed by Gaudi and there’s the Picasso museum with a fabulous collection.But when visiting Barcelona,be very careful.Staying in Barcelona should be minimised to just a few days to visit Gaudi’s monuments and the famous Picasso museum,and get out of the city quickly.If you’re not that rich,Pablo’s place is alright to spend a few days.But if you’re on a short holiday and have the cash,stay in good hotels in prime area.Do not stay in Barcelona for too long or make too many revisits.Spain is different from other countries in Western Europe.And Barcelona is high in crime organised by (Website hidden by Airbnb) by train in and out of Barcelona if you carry expensive photographic equipment,paying a higher transport fee than buses is worth the while to have you better protected."},{"_id":"404216035","date":{"$date":"2019-01-23T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"35379","reviewer_id":"217605121","reviewer_name":"Julián","comments":"This was quite better than expected, location is good."},{"_id":"405027220","date":{"$date":"2019-01-26T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"35379","reviewer_id":"107083973","reviewer_name":"Ernesto","comments":"Pablo es un excelente host, nos ayudo guardando nuestras maletas ya que nuestro avión salía después del check out."},{"_id":"406057657","date":{"$date":"2019-01-28T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"35379","reviewer_id":"20448977","reviewer_name":"Mohamed Amine","comments":"Logement  bien situé , Pablo est très accueillant et aidant. je recommande"},{"_id":"406906071","date":{"$date":"2019-01-31T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"35379","reviewer_id":"123789308","reviewer_name":"Golnaz","comments":"Pablo \u0026 Alice are wonderful hosts and they made me feel right at home.

Clean and tidy with all essentials you will need. Comfortable beds. Nice and elegant interior design, stunning view at the balcony. Great location, less than a minute walk to the metro station Urquinaona, a few supermarkets near the building, many restaurants and cafes in that street and the street behind. Very close to most of the sightseeing points such as Sagrada familia, casa mila and casa batllo, and the central of barcelona.(you can walk if you want, like 10-20 mins)\n\nWe already loved it on the first day we arrived the apartment. But what makes us love it even more now is that on the second day I made a huge mistake, the door was locked by accident and we were unable to get into the flat. At the same time we were running late to Sagrada familia as we bought the tickets already. After I told Claudia and Oriol what happened, they were not worrying about the difficulty to re-open the door again, but asking if we have left the tickets in the apartment. Thank god tickets were in the bag already.\n\nWe would love to come back again to barcelona may be after the Sagrada familia is finished haha and if we did, we will definitely book the same apartment again!!

The flat itself was well equipped and comfortable, although it would have been nice to find some tea, milk, mineral water, etc., rather than just the single pot of nescafe. A detail but nonetheless in need of fixing: the shower \"holder\" is broken, so one has to manually hold the shower set, which is a bit annoying if you want to relax in the shower after a day walking around the city. The area was noisy until the early hours of the morning (4-5am), but we were there Friday and Saturday nights, so I think this is quite normal for Barcelona and there are certainly much noisier places and far less well insulated appartments.

Unfortunately, the hand shower holder was broken which was an inconvenience since we could not shower hands free.  Ran out of liquid hand soap for the sink and a box of tissue would have been appreciated. Towels could have softer. They were rather hard/stiff. Otherwise, the apartment was very good. The only other drawback is the traffic noise even though we were on the 6th floor. The window doors shut out most of the noise and the shutters blocked any bright sunlight.

As a result, it can be a bit noisy in the evenings.  We were only in Barcelona for 2 days, so the trade-off between location and noise was well worth it.  If I were returning to Barcelona for a longer visit, I would likely stay a bit further out.  However, if I return for a short visit, I would definitely stay here again. The host stayed in touch from the time we booked through our departure and the check-in/check-out process could not have been easier.  Here's a hint if the elevator doesn't appear to be working during your visit:  it may just be stuck on a particular floor.  When we arrived with 2 large bags and discovered the elevator remained at the 6th floor, my son walked up the stairs (minus the bags, of course) and just sent the elevator down to the ground floor - so no hauling heavy bags up six flights of stairs.  Incidentally, after reporting this to the host, it was immediately corrected and the elevator worked fine for the rest of the trip."},{"_id":"161973626","date":{"$date":"2017-06-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3567993","reviewer_id":"114000701","reviewer_name":"Caro","comments":"El departamento es tal como se ve en las fotos con todo lo necesario.

They close on Sundays - and now we also have a small Thai restaurant - not fancy at all but their food is not pricy and very decent - it is right next to the Domino's Pizza on the corner across from my place ;)  You can grab a good artisan draught beer at Mikkeler's on c/Valencia or sit on La Guapa's terrace just one block from home on c/Urgell.  If you are into japanese streetkitchen - try out Yatai on c/Urgell - a couple of blocks from my place - good food at reasonable prices in interesting manga-surroundings. If you are looking for breakfast out and about I can definitely recommend the \"El Ninot\" bar at the local market - they offer good produce, a very nice and spacious setting within the local food market - and good WiFi as well ;)","notes":"The room as mentionned is SMALL - but it now has aircondition working with both cooling \u0026 heating, so you should be able to adjust to just the right temperature for you and be at ease.

The H10 wich leaves 1 block away will take you all across town and then you have the Bus 59 just 2 blocks away which takes you down to Las Ramblas and all the way to the beaches (and back) although I find that most places are within walking distance - of course always depending on your tolerance for walking... You have two different metro lines close by - the red and the blue one which can also come in handy if you want to move faster than by foot or bus.

Flowers near the bed, bottles of water –all these little things show that Katja is glad to host you:).The location of the flat is very convenient and it is easy to get to all the attractions of Barcelona. We went practically everywhere on foot. It took us about 15 min to get to Casa Batlló, 20 min to Plaça de Catalunya and 15 min to Estació de Barcelona-Sants (the main railway station of Barcelona). \r\nThe flat itself is very nice, cozy and quiet. We had a private bathroom and a terrace. From the terrace  you can enjoy a wonderful view over Tibidado Mountain. We were also allowed to use the kitchen. Wi-Fi works very quickly:)\r\nKatja is a wonderful host, she is very nice and considerate. Her cat is also very polite.

Hun sikrede sig at jeg vidste at det var et lille værese, inden jeg accepterede og hun har en præcis vejledning til hvordan man finder hendes hjem. Hun var hjemme og tog godt imd os. Værelset er lille , men fint og der er hvad man skal bruge til at sove og slappe af. Badeværelset var også fint og rent, men en smule slidt:-). Dejligt med balkon og gode senge. Katja var hyggelig og meget hjælpsom med at foreslå hvad vi skulle se og hvordan vi kom rundt. God placering centralt i byen, hvorfra man nemt kan komme rundt. selve gaden/nærmeste område var ikke meget spændende, men af samme grund også mest for de lokale. Vores allerstørste anbefalinger til Katjas værelse, hvis man har brug for et stille sted at sove og sidde i solen og ikke stiller krav til køkkenfaciliteter (hvem gider lave mad i Barcelona:-).

Não é ruim, mas saibam que não há janelas. Talvez no verão isso faça falta. É espaçoso e tudo novo, porém a cama não é tão confortável para os padrões americanos. A roupa de cama é algo que pode melhorar muiiiiiito. Duas quadras para o metro. O Expresso te leva em meia hora a Manhattan, linha D. A linha R local demora uns 50 minutos, vc tem que fazer baldeação pra linha D. Tem um café a uma quadra (use o (Hidden by Airbnb) maps) Bagel Factory 1 (orgânicos) e um pub incrível pra jantar, comida farta, cerveja boa, Freddy's. Tem um mercado em frente ao Bagel. Vc pode pedir comida a noite no Muscle Maker, pelo app Seamless. O bairro é recheado de cafés, bares, restaurantes. Tem um Starbucks a 15 minutos a pé com uma estação de metrô colada a ele. Usem o (Hidden by Airbnb) maps. Chip de celular na T Mobile 30usd para um mês com 4g, plano turista. Otimo. O apartamento não tem lavanderia, infelizmente, mas tem uma a duas quadras próxima ao metro. O bairro é residencial e muito bonito e tranquilo. Tem Internet.

I didn't get to talk to Irwin in person (only through messages) but I talked to Grace and their son quite a few times and both of them were so welcoming, friendly, and helpful.\nThe location is incredible. The apartment is located near the Concordia University Metro station, as well as a bus stop that will get you to a lot of places. The city in general is very walkable and the location really takes advantage of that - there are quite a few restaurants/cafes/grocery stores within a 15 minute walking distance, and the main downtown shopping area is close too. Vieux Montréal is just a short metro ride away.\nThe apartment itself is very clean and while the kitchen/dining area is small, it's well laid out and fully equipped. While I didn't use it during my stay, there is an in-unit washer/dryer. The room is a nice size, and I liked that there was a private bathroom attached. The bed was pretty hard, which didn't really bother me but is something to keep in mind. Sheets, a towel, a pillow, some hangers in the closet, toilet paper and body wash were all provided. The air con was awesome too, especially since it gets quite hot/humid in the summer.\nMy biggest negative staying here was the water pressure. They warned me beforehand that the building was old and therefore the water pressure could be low from time to time, but to just wait a few minutes and try again. Typically this wouldn't bother me at all, but there were two days where I couldn't take a shower because there wasn't water, even after waiting 30 or more minutes. When there was water, there was a light stream - sufficient enough to wash hands, but not much else. I hate leaving negative feedback, and maybe I just came on a bad week, but it was something that bothered me enough where I feel it's important to let other guests know. I truly hope they're able to fix the water pressure problem somehow, because a part from that everything was perfect."},{"_id":"335566032","date":{"$date":"2018-10-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3581676","reviewer_id":"187610936","reviewer_name":"Yan","comments":"整洁干净 生活环境很便利 有好多超市和餐馆 美中不足的是洗澡的水压不是很大 但是不影响正常生活"},{"_id":"337512224","date":{"$date":"2018-10-16T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3581676","reviewer_id":"26891205","reviewer_name":"Jayati","comments":"Grace and Irwin’s place was absolutely perfect—right in the heart of the city, with the metro, restaurants, and grocery stores just a stones throw away.

However, even though being close to this service and the location I just described, I had a lot of trouble with other issues during my stay.\n\nMy main problems were the water pressure in the apartment was not good since the first week I arrived to the apartment, and this problem was never given a solution to during my whole stay there. There were several times when I got really late to several appointments at my job, had to cancel plans or reschedule my whole day because the water pressure would be so low that I couldn't take a shower without the water stopping every 2 minutes, and sometimes even for 30 minutes, making it impossible for me to take a whole shower in a small amount of time. Several times I had to write the owners to ask for a solution, since this kept being a bother to me and I only kept being told to be patient and try to understand the situation. During my stay in Montreal, this problem only kept getting worse, both in quantity (every time the amount of water coming out of the shower, bathroom and kitchen sink would be even less) and frequency (it kept happening more and more frequently, frist every week, then every 3 days until it was every day) and what got me really disappointed is that I never felt this situation was handled correctly by the owners. It wasn't until my last week in the apartment that the water situation got so bad that it ran out completely and my roommate and me were left with NO water for 2 days and a half, that one of the owners went by and saw the problem by herself. I didn't like that still, there was no soluton to the problem. During these days, I had to buy several bottles and gallons of water and even suscribe to a gym in order for me to take showers and be able to use a bathroom. It was a problem that really changed the whole perception I had of the apartment as well as the owners' abilities to solve conflicts raised during the stay of a visitor. As I mentioned in one point to the owners, this kind of trouble was never described like this neither in person nor in the Airbnb website, and I think it should be mentioned before someone decides to stay in a new place.\n\nAlso, I have to mention that I did not feel comfortable being in the apartment  several times because the owners of the building or part of their family would enter in the apartment and make use of the utensils there (e.g.: the kitchen, washer, drier, etc.) while the guest where there. I made me feel as if I had no privacy and I was not paying for a place to be my home for those weeks, but instead felt as if it was not my apartment and I couldn't feel comfortable there.\n\nBesides this, the apartment is really well located in Downtown Montreal and the location of the metro (1 min walk) is a really nice plus for this building."}]}

The walkup apartment is close to Parc Mont Royal for a hike or challenging run, and within a short walk of 3 Bixi bike stations (the best way to see Montreal is by bike; we took the Bixi everywhere, day and night0- to Biosphere, Jazz Festival, Stadium de Montreal for World Cup).  Also close to the metro and bus to Airport.  Marie was very attentive in leaving information on the Montreal Jazz Festival.  We enjoyed the festival thoroughly, and were able to get tickets to see John Mayall, a lifelong dream for myself and my spouse.  The apartment was exactly as pictured, kitchen well-equipped (I cooked for us one night) and walkable to very hip area of bars, cafes, and restaurants.  The NetFlix worked great to stream (Canada has a lot more content available than the USA), and Marie's internet was fast.  Our second trip to Montreal, and quite enjoyed staying there.

The apartment is conveniently located in one of Istanbul's chicest residential areas, Nisantasi, in the basement of a nice old building. Prime location for cafes/brunch spots, small bakeries, grocery stores, but also a heaven for luxury shoppers. Having been to Istanbul before, I must admit Nisantasi was a better choice than the very touristy areas around Taksim or Sultanahmet. There were dolmus buses and taxis just round the corner from the street we stayed, which made it easy for us to commute to all the places we wanted to visit. \r\n\r\nThe flat itself - exactly what you see in the photos, and more. Clean, super cozy \u0026 homey, warm (mind you, we visited Istanbul at he end of December 2014, so the warmth was well needed), with everything necessary made available for our 4-day trip. It was definitely spacious enough for two people, and the way the flat is organised makes it very liveable. It really felt like home, and the flat has a lot of personality: family photos, nice artsy touches here and there, hand-crafted antique furniture, they all make for a vintage-y and boutique-y feel. Bonus points for the nice Christmas tree waiting for us in the living room, which made the whole atmosphere feel even more like holiday. \r\n\r\nThough we haven't met Irmak, she has been a great host and arranged for us to pick up the key from someone. Flexible, very accommodating and willing to share tips and recommendations about restaurants and places to see in Istanbul, Irmak was always available to chat and responded promptly when we had any queries. \r\n \r\nHighly recommended place for travellers who enjoy a clean, cosy flat with plenty of personality, in a nice quiet neighbourhood.

As you see the room has a fantastic vintage colour in it and the bed was so cleaned and the fan and air-condition worked very well in humid HongKong summer weather! \nThe host steve, he is a very kind and gentle for the guest! \nThe toilet is a very small and tiny space, but you should experience how HongKong people use their space well. I was so impressed for that too :)\n\nAlso with a very happy price, you will have sweet dream indeed!!!\n\nThe house is really close to the PrinceEdward station by walk 10 minutes and there is a public football court as well.

She didn't speak English well, but that was not a big deal at first. I woke up the next day to our door knocking so I opened it and it's a dude, apparently the boyfriend of the other guest. He walked in with food and the two were eating on the bed and talking. After their meal, they started cuddling. Initially I didn't really care, but as I needed to get ready, clean up and check out, things were getting a little annoying and uncomfortable. As mentioned above, the bathroom is really REALLY tiny; you can't take a shower and get dressed in there because there's absolutely no space for that. I somehow managed to take shower and get dressed in and outside of the 0.5 bathroom with extreme discomfort and difficulty. It's 15 minutes before my check-out time so I tell the other guest that I'll be back to grab something to eat and drink real quick and that I'll be back in 10 minutes. She says \"okay see you.\" I come back after 10 minutes and they are having sex. It's just really rude that she was using this \"FEMALE DORM\" as her private hotel room. \r\n\r\nAlthough Steve was very very helpful and understanding, I think there's still room for improvement in managing the space more efficiently and considerably."},{"_id":"39805446","date":{"$date":"2015-07-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3618467","reviewer_id":"6270520","reviewer_name":"Ember","comments":"This was a great space.

It's not *that* small, certainly not by Hong Kong standards. It's got nice colors and a certain charm. And the apartment is very well thought out; lots of things you'd need (laundry line, hot pot, etc) and very little that you don't need. And the Sham Shui Po area is hopping. It's got a very \"old Hong Kong\" feel. HK as a whole has gotten rich, and kinda soft; this feels like the old HK where people are still really hustling to improve their lives. \nMinuses:\nFirst, the bed/mattress was super hard. OMG it was hard. I've slept on carpeted floors that were softer. A new mattress will make this place much better. Second, while the apartment itself is very clean, the building is dirty. \nFinally, I'd say the Sham Shui Po area is also not for everyone. I really liked staying there, but I'm a city guy and I know how to take care of myself. HK as a whole is super safe, and can feel kind of sanitized at times. This neighborhood still has an edge to it - which I liked, but again, not for everyone.

It has everything you need, most importantly a good washing machine and dehumidifier - two things essential for Hong Kong! I've experienced no problems with electricity or water heater, Aircon also works as should. Some things like toilet and crane were recently repaired and are pleasure to use.\nThe area (SSP) is amazing. It's the area where working class people and migrants settle, thus it is cheap, resourceful and any conversation on the street brings you genuine knowledge of HK culture. A true immersion if you wanted that kind of experience. Check-in and checkout were extremely straightforward and fast. \nAmong minuses, the shower room is small. It was okay for me though. Dehumidifier helped a lot if apartment get humid. \nI totally recommend the host and the place."}]}

He answered my inquiries and responded to my requests quickly even if it was wee hours.\n\nMike gave us instructions on how to get to his place and met us at the bus stop. His place contains information about Hong Kong, from where to go and how to get around l, and it had discount cards for tourists (however, we were not able to use that).\n\nThe place was cozy indeed, just as advertised. It was clean, quiet and safe. It is located near public transportation stations (MTR, bus and ferry) and shopping stalls. Mike let us leave our luggage before and after check-in, so that we can roam around freely.\n\nWish we could've stay longer, but we were scheduled for a cruise.

Very easy to deal with, always quick to respond, and very on top of things.

I would definitely love to deal with him again in the future.\r\n\r\nThe location is extremely convenient and central. TST is mega crowded, but from the top floor of the building where the room is, it isn't very noisy at all.\r\n\r\nThe room is indeed very clean and modern, but very compact. I had no problems with the size, but I can see it being tedious if you are in the room more than just sleeping each night or have a huge suitcase. The two things I didn't like about the room are that there is no window, although I can see this being an advantage for those who want to sleep late, and the water boiler only holds enough hot water for about a 3-5 minute shower. You can heat up water for another shower within 15 minutes, but realistically it is a bit inconvenient to take two showers, so I ended up taking one very economical shower instead each night.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I would recommend this room because it is very clean and convenient, has a great host, and the price is very fair for the surrounding area."},{"_id":"26139618","date":{"$date":"2015-02-04T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3631518","reviewer_id":"10662023","reviewer_name":"Mike","comments":"This room is a traditional Hong Kong apartment.

The room is as described, clean and tidy and comfortable although it is starting to get a bit rough round the edges from normal wear and tear. The location is convenient for Istiklal.  The neighborhood is off the main streets and could be a little intimidating for females alone. I was waiting for my daughter in a car outside when I was forced to move further down the street to allow another vehicle to pass. As soon as I stopped a very intimidating character knocked on the window and told me to move in a very menacing manner. I was not in anybody's parking space or blocking anything.

He responded quickly to all of our questions, requests, and concerns. On numerous occasions I texted him and he responded within minutes. In regards to the flat, there were definitely pros and cons. Pros: great view, elevator, air conditioning, full size fridge and fully stocked kitchen ideal for eating in. Cons: The flat is not great for tall people... the kitchen and back bedroom both have fairly low sloped ceilings. The hot water was unpredictable but I didn't bring this to Ati's attention so I'm sure he would fix it. There was a strong chemical odor almost like a hair salon that seemed to come and go. Also there seemed to be a mold/mildew problem in the bathroom. I know this is common in old buildings but with the humidity it was particularly bothersome. Overall I had a great time staying here. In my experience with Istanbul flats this was a normal experience. I would also mention that the flat is smaller than the photos make it look. Luckily the balcony is nice ;) In regards to the neighborhood, it's a fantastic location especially if you plan on doing touristy stuff but want to also be close to Taksim. It's a 5 minute walk uphill to Taksim and a 10 minute walk downhill to get the Tram which can take you to all of the sites like Sultan Ahmet, Top Kapi, and the Bazaars. You can also easily walk to the Kabatas ferry station. I felt totally safe in the neighborhood. There is a lot of construction so it's not the most beautiful street in the city but it's convenience makes it worth it. Overall I would recommend this flat. Like I said, any problems that were brought to Ati's attention were dealt with promptly so that was great.

A bus goes straight from the airport to Taksim Sqaure and the apartment is a couple of blocks from Taksim square and only a tad furthur in the opposite direction to the T1 tram that is easy to maneuver. It connects New Town to Old Town and makes it really easy (and cheap!) to get around. The place also has a fantastic balcony with a lovely view. While Ati was a responsive communicator, we did have an issue with meeting up to get the house keys. Something came up and he was unable to meet the first person in our party to arrive. This made it very difficult to access the apartment since she told him that her phone would not work in Istanbul beforehand. The neighbors who had the keys didn't seem well informed that we were coming and there is a trick to opening the door that is not very intuitive. After a long day of traveling, it is notable that this process could have been much smoother. The only other issue that we had was with the hot water. During our stay, the hot water was very unreliable and alternated between ice cold and scalding hot, when it worked at all. Ati was responsive, came to take a look, but couldn't seem to get repairmen out to fix the problem(it seems the hot water heater failed). The water problem was a bit out of Ati's control. He was very apologetic about the meet up. He bought us a beer, stayed in contact and let us leave our bags past check out time on the day we had to leave since we had a late flight. He also suggested a great place for us to eat. Other than the 2 issues, we had a lovely stay and found the apartment to be a perfect fit for the three of us!

Amazing view to wake up in the morning and only ten minutes walk from taksim square and close to underground and nightlife. \nWiFi was available but couldn't vouched for it cuz we were using our sim card. Hot water and heater works and you get simple cooking equipments which was good. I did hear the pigeons in the morning and night time as someone mentioned but I wasn't bothered even I am a light sleeper. \nOverall a lovely experience, one thing to be careful though,  one night I was quite drunk and since the gate at the ground floor of the building was quite heavy, I hurt my finger and the cut was quite deep ...

The bedroom and kitchen have a sloping ceiling which is a bit difficult to not bump in to - but it I still think it was perfectly comfortable. The balcony is lovely to sit in and enjoy a meal or some drinks in the evening with a nice view of the sea. The bathroom shower cabinet is broken and doesn't shut - hope Ati fixes this soon ! Some reviewers have complained about the wifi but Ati had sent me the passwords beforehand and it worked well. Communication with Ati was a bit slow but didn't pose much of a problem. There is a steep hill to reach the apartment (as in most of Istanbul) but this can be easily avoided by taking two sets of stairs which was a great relief ! It took barely 7 mins to walk to Taksim square (which has a lot of shops/cafes/bars/restaurants and the metro) and has a few mini supermarkets 2-3 mins away which have all the essentials. The only thing that wasn't that easy was that we were reaching the airport at 9am but the apartment was only ready at 2pm as Ati had guests before. He did allow us to come in and leave our bags and take the keys at 1pm while the cleaning lady was there which was very helpful but I wish I had known this before making the booking as I may have tried booking a place with an earlier check in time. As the time is not on the description page - I suggest you check with Ati what time you can check in before booking if you are planning to come in early ! All in all, we really liked the apartment - and I would definitely choose this place for my next stay in Istanbul !"},{"_id":"34175225","date":{"$date":"2015-06-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3640004","reviewer_id":"29867498","reviewer_name":"Jeffrey","comments":"We booked an Air Bnb with Ati but he had some sort of crisis with his cleaning lady (she had to go to the hospital in the morning?), so when we arrived at the Air Bnb it wasn't clean or ready.

Und es war eine gute Wahl.\nDas Apartment ist sehr schön und sauber, \ndie Einteilung ist zweckmäßig und gut durchdacht,\ndie Aussicht auf den Bosporus vom Balkon ist grandios,\nauch das gegenüberliegende Häusermeer ist faszinierend.\nDie Lage ist perfekt. Ich habe meine Ausflüge meistens mit der Tramway\nin Findikli begonnen. Zurückgekehrt bin ich mit der Metro oder dem\nFüniküler nach Taksim, so vermied ich den steilen Hang. \nDie Gegend ist sicher, nachts ist es ruhig, denn es sind keine Lokale in\nunmittelbarer Nähe.\nDer Krach der Tauben war für mich kein Problem, denn ich habe\neinen guten und tiefen Schlaf.\nAtilim war sehr hilfsbereit, Probleme wurden sofort gelöst."},{"_id":"340552812","date":{"$date":"2018-10-24T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3640004","reviewer_id":"12683136","reviewer_name":"Gabriel","comments":"Clean apartment with a beautiful view in Taksim, which is a lively and central area of Istanbul. The apartment is a five minute walk from a metro station that will take you anywhere in the city. There’s also an airport bus near there as well. Communication, check-in - everything went smoothly. I couldn’t have asked for a better experience in Istanbul. Will definitely stay again!"},{"_id":"343018663","date":{"$date":"2018-10-30T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3640004","reviewer_id":"29583773","reviewer_name":"Barbara","comments":"The location of the flat is perfect, everything there thats needed, but not much space for eating together.
