(Groceries at Marche Maisonneuve were a quick ride away on the 139 bus from Pie-IX station.) The sparkling new appliances and furnishings and modern heating system made for a comfortable, problem-free stay in late-November temperatures.  Entering and exiting the apartment was safe and easy, with the keyless lock system in place.\n\nThoughtful touches included plentiful linens, spare umbrellas in the closet, and various toiletry/personal care items available for use. Susan checked in regularly to make sure our stay was going well.\n\nThe location was convenient: easy access to the center of the city, but removed enough for a quiet retreat from the bustle. I enjoyed catching a glimpse of everyday life in the residential Hochelaga-Maisonneuve neighborhood. (College de Maisonneuve, literally across the street, serves post-high school/pre-college students, coming and going throughout the day.)\n\nStaying at L’Ideal on our first trip to Montreal and as our first use of Airbnb was a choice I was glad to have made.

My two friends and I came to this Brooklyn loft on a girl's trip and loved it. Every night, after the long days of walking around the city, it was the coziest and artsiest place to come back to. Logan also gave us some good recommendations for places in the area which were all amazing! Parking is limited though, we had the horrible experience of getting multiple tickets for not reading the street parking signs closely enough, but nonetheless, it was fun. For the most part, we could find street parking not far at all, but be aware of those signs! Overall, you definitely get the true Brooklyn feel in this loft and in this location. Logan's communication and hospitality was great. I hope one day we can stay here again!"},{"_id":"366382769","date":{"$date":"2019-01-02T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14916806","reviewer_id":"5699885","reviewer_name":"Evelyn","comments":"We enjoyed the time in your generous and stylish Appartement very much!

Thursday was my actual birthday and this almost had us packing up and heading home - we were minutes away from cancelling the weekend as we had no way of getting in to the house we had booked for 12 guests. We then get inside and everyone starts to arrive and we all shower and use the toilets. By the time we come out the smell of raw sewage is so unbearable that we can't use the balcony for the dinner we had planned or open any windows on a hot day in a house that has no air con (not that air con was ever listed or promised however). The smell only got worse throughout the weekend as we continued to use the bathrooms. 6 out of 12 guests chose to leave on Friday as a result - ruining the weekend we had planned for my birthday. Two of the couples who left had travelled interstate for this. So they had paid for 3 nights and only got to stay 1 in rooms that stunk of sewage. This could have and should have been resolved on Friday or Saturday - but no solution was offered and we were expected to stay in a house that stunk of sewage. On top of this on Friday, as we bring items down from the car into the house we place two cases on a shelf along the kitchen wall and it comes off completely and lands on my foot. After looking at how it was constructed, a 30-50kg shelf was screwed together by 4 small screws and was never constructed to hold any sort of weight, making it a danger to guests. And lastly, the alarm. At 2.30am on the Saturday morning the house alarm (that we had been told did not work) began going off and woke everyone in the house. The four surrounding suburbs encountered a blackout and as a result the alarm went to auxiliary power and then went into alarm (the blackout is obviously not the owners fault) The alarm continued to go off for an hour and there was no information anywhere as to how to make it stop. We were left to figure this out for ourselves. The number we called inside the panel had no idea, the host was not contactable and the lady he put us in touch with suggested \"we push a couple of buttons\". The house should not have been rented out with the sewage pump the way it was and the host should have information on hand for his alarm system. We know that the host MAY not have known the pump was broken, but we did make him aware as soon as we noticed it within a couple of hours of arriving and no solution was offered for the three day stay. If we had..."},{"_id":"136625567","date":{"$date":"2017-03-11T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14921505","reviewer_id":"61865773","reviewer_name":"Tammy","comments":"A wonderful home away from home.

That means shoes, slippers, sandals, flip-flops/thongs (but don't say that in Hawaii, we call 'em SLIPPAHS!), reef-walkers, slip-ons, Crocs, etc.  2) RINSE OFF ALL SAND BEFORE ENTERING THE HOUSE. Chances are, if you survived the pounding shore break at Waimea, you got a load of sand in your bathing suit. This will clog up the plumbing in the shower, so PLEASE leave the sand at the beach or rinse out your suits with the hose before entering the studio. 3) Do not hang beach towels on balcony. DO hang them on the clothesline downstairs. 4) Do not use the white bath towels for food spills, muddy feet or makeup removal, etc. That's what the rags (under the kitchen and bathroom sinks) and black wash towels are for!   5) No extra guests. 6) RESPECT the ocean. NEVER turn your back on her. If in doubt, don't go out. Swim at beaches that have a lifeguard nearby.","property_type":"Guest suite","room_type":"Entire home/apt","bed_type":"Real Bed","minimum_nights":"3","maximum_nights":"13","cancellation_policy":"strict_14_with_grace_period","last_scraped":{"$date":"2019-03-06T05:00:00.000Z"},"calendar_last_scraped":{"$date":"2019-03-06T05:00:00.000Z"},"first_review":{"$date":"2016-11-08T05:00:00.000Z"},"last_review":{"$date":"2019-03-03T05:00:00.000Z"},"accommodates":2,"bedrooms":0,"beds":2,"number_of_reviews":76,"bathrooms":{"$numberDecimal":"1.0"},"amenities":["TV","Internet","Wifi","Air conditioning","Kitchen","Free parking on premises","Washer","Dryer","Smoke detector","First aid kit","Safety card","Fire extinguisher","Essentials","Shampoo","Hangers","Hair dryer","Iron","Laptop friendly workspace","translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_49","translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_50","Self check-in","Lockbox","Private entrance","High chair","Children’s books and toys","Pack ’n Play/travel crib","Hot water","Microwave","Coffee maker","Refrigerator","Dishes and silverware","Cooking basics","Stove","BBQ grill","Patio or balcony","Garden or backyard","Beach essentials","Beachfront"],"price":{"$numberDecimal":"199.00"},"security_deposit":{"$numberDecimal":"100.00"},"cleaning_fee":{"$numberDecimal":"150.00"},"extra_people":{"$numberDecimal":"50.00"},"guests_included":{"$numberDecimal":"2"},"images":{"thumbnail_url":"","medium_url":"","picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/144bc743-2607-4055-904e-2ff5717678d5.jpg?aki_policy=large","xl_picture_url":""},"host":{"host_id":"11061760","host_url":"https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/11061760","host_name":"Melissa","host_location":"Haleiwa, Hawaii, United States","host_about":"My siblings and I live on and maintain this property at Waimea Bay Pointe.

When the surf is not up, enjoy a swim at Waimea Bay Beach Park, a short walk away.  Don't miss a Mahi sandwich or plate lunch at Ted's Bakery, just up the road.  Finish the meal off with a slice of chocolate haupia pie.  The quarters are spacious and comfortable and private.  The furnishings by Nak on Wood complete the beach decor (go Nakamura brothers).  You're a visitor in a friendly, family compound.  If you get a chance ask Marlene to share her story of the land, she'll tell you a wonderful, Hawaiian melting pot tale.

The apartment was exactly as described and fully equipped with all necessary appliances and has a feel like home atmosphere. The apartment doesn't have an open view on to Waimea Bay but we didn't expect that, as it was clearly described in the location profile. Instead the great view on to the famous surfing spot of Waimea Bay Point can be enjoyed from the garden which is being shared with Melissa and her very nice family. But this of course does not mean that you cannot have full privacy. During our stay we occasionally met Marlene, Melissa's  sister, who was always nice and fun to talk to and gave us a lot of valuable information. Haleiwa itself, which is a 10 minutes drive by car, offers nice restaurants, cafes, food trucks, souvenir shops and boutiques, so it is a nice place to hang around in the evening. And if you want occasionally the big city lights, Honolulu is only a 1 hour drive away. Even though the waters at the North Shore are much rougher and not always allow swimming, we would always prefer to stay here and if waters are getting too rough go for a swim to Kailua etc. by car"},{"_id":"139890156","date":{"$date":"2017-03-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14923016","reviewer_id":"43095625","reviewer_name":"Yanon","comments":"This is truly an amazing, gem of a place!!

The most perfect location on the North Shore - close to everything (the supermarket Foodland, the food trucks, the pipeline, many other beaches, Waimea Valley and so many other great things)!\n\nThe 5 top things we appreciated the most are:\n- 3-4 min walk to Waimea Beach and Three Tables (both amazing beaches), which also meant we could leave our car at home and not fight for a parking space with everyone else.\n- Great wifi\n- Comfy bed\n- Beach gear that we could borrow, a washing machine and dryer also on site\n- The studio itself - it wasn't what I would call a luxury residence, but it just had everything you needed and was so well-planned, comfortable and cosy!\nAnd last, but not least - Melissa and her family!\n\nA couple of things that are good to know:\n- This residence is close to the road and there is a lot of traffic and ambulances/rescue vehicles passing by\n- Since this is an ocean property the waves outside pound against the rocks (which we love!)\nIf you do need really quiet when going to sleep - bring your ear plugs, because it gets a bit noisy sometimes, but don't let that stop you from staying here! \n\nIn our book, this is a 5-star residence!

After traveling extensively through the North Shore, we can say without a doubt the property location and serene views of Waimea Bay are among the best on the island if not in the continental United States. We were blown away (almost literally by the false Ballistic Missile warning) by Melissa's hospitality and generosity. We sat for hours and watched big wave surfers attempt to ride massive waves from their backyard. If big waves are in season (Winter)  and the conditions are right you are in for some entertainment. The unit was charming, clean, and so worth the drive! This property and immediate surroundings were so incredible we actually got engaged here. You can hear the waves breaking (in season) from your bed. \n\nThe unit was surrounded by lush vegetation and breathtaking views. As I understand it this property overlooks the exact location where James Cook \"discovered\" Hawaii and came ashore. I get why, it's stunning. The beach is a short walk (like 1 minute). The unit is the perfect beach retreat and offers a lot of privacy. I recommend grilling here at sunset with fresh fish. I can't speak highly enough about our hosts. As a New Yorker, I have to try to be more like them, calm, helpful, collected, funny, and at peace. This place is a dream.

Whilst we didn’t have full ocean views from the accommodation we did have full access to the front yard where we spent most evenings listening to the crashing waves and having a beer or two. We had the choice of Waimea Beach one way and Three Tables Beach the other, both only minutes away.  Foodland and places to eat were within easy walking distance.\n\nI have always wanted to visit the North Shore and couldn’t have picked a nicer play to stay with such a welcoming family. They were kind, helpful and always there when we needed them. \n\nIf you want to somewhere to stay on the North Shore then this is the place to go.\n\nThanks Melissa and Marlene."},{"_id":"231358336","date":{"$date":"2018-01-31T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14923016","reviewer_id":"37923179","reviewer_name":"Tamás","comments":"We had a round trip over Oahu and I'm glad that we have found Melissa's place! What can I say It's not just the cozy appartment itself but Melissa's kindness far exceeded our expectations. Because of It's perfect location you're literally in the middle of the North Shore! In few minutes drive you can find everything you need like shops and restaurants but Kaena Point or Turtle Bay (the two opposite sides of northern O'ahu) are not even more than 30 minutes away. Morover If you go there in winter (as we did) the word famous surf spots like Banzai Pipeline are just few minutes away! In january/february don't forget to check the surf competition calendar so If you're lucky then you can see the word's greatest riders on the legendary waves. One morning Melissa wrote us to visit the Banzai Pipeline as soon as we can because of the Volcom PipelinePro Word Championship has just began so we did and it was awsome. (Thank you Melissa once again for the tip!!!) She was so helpful as She gave us super useful daily tips about the area and also helped us to find some vegetarian/vegan eating places. But not even her kind words but the fresh fruits and vegetables She took us every day were so kind - she made us feel like being part of her family. The apartment looks big in the picrures but It's even bigger in the reality! It's well equiped, super cozy and absolutely clean - one of our best airbnb appartments so far!!! We realy enjoyed our stay there and hope we can get back one day! So If you're about to discover the northern side of O'ahu then stop searching because Melissa's appartment is the place you're looking for!!!!"},{"_id":"233720375","date":{"$date":"2018-02-10T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14923016","reviewer_id":"9065944","reviewer_name":"Antoine","comments":"Great spot !"},{"_id":"237147429","date":{"$date":"2018-02-21T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14923016","reviewer_id":"45889680","reviewer_name":"Renee","comments":"This property and apartment is truly a piece of paradise, a place that my husband and I were lucky to call home for just over a week. We enjoyed our accommodation and stay on the North Shore so much that we tried to extend our visit only to find that there were no flights back home to accommodate us. \n\nMelissa was a wonderful host, she and her sister Marlene were extremely welcoming and kind. The apartment itself was clean, smelt great, comfortable, filled with beautiful artwork created by their late father that illustrated some of the wonderful history of Waimea Bay. It just had such a warm and lovely feel, it has everything you need and more. \n\nThe sound of the ocean was a constant, and the front yard was just magic. You could see Waimea Bay and ocean forever, lots of whales breaching daily, its safe to say we spent a lot of time enjoying this view with friends who were staying close by. There were many nights watching the sunset with a drink in hand, and BBQ cooking, it was pure relaxation. \n\nThe location to Food Land and the famous food trucks (which has amazing food) was an easy 5-7minute walk. Visiting Pipeline was almost a daily ritual, it was approximately a 25-30 minute walk, 7minute cycle or a short drive. Some great local hikes are in the area and if you have a car, driving up to Turtle Bay and visiting the town of Haleiwa is a must! \n\nWe will certainly be back to visit this incredible place that Melissa and her family are so lucky to call home."},{"_id":"241350162","date":{"$date":"2018-03-08T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14923016","reviewer_id":"12934733","reviewer_name":"Devorah","comments":"Great place.

Melissa went above and beyond to make our stay great, and was very quick to respond and communicate if we needed to. Everything was clean, neat, and instructions easy to follow.

David himself was really nice and gave us great tips on where to go in Porto!\nMy main issue with the place was the shower, there was hardly any water pressure and the showerhead had to be held by hand. Also the bed is very noisy, it's an old spring matrass, an it's length is only just enough when 1.85m tall. There is very noticeable streetnoise, although for me that isn't a problem.\nStill, we had a nice stay in Porto and got a really nice dinner thanks to David's recommendations. His knowledge and advice where to go in Porto is what was best about the stay!"},{"_id":"201341918","date":{"$date":"2017-10-08T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14930875","reviewer_id":"40246794","reviewer_name":"Kristian","comments":"Awesome spot to see everything.

She also let us park in her driveway for the whole 6 days we were there.\r\n\r\nThe appartment looked exactly like the pictures. The bathroom was beautiful and the bed was comfortable. We had cable, internet and a small kitchenette (no oven). We would've liked to have more kitchen ustensiles to cook, and more pots! But that was honestly the only negative thing we have to say. \r\n\r\nNatasha was always available to answer our questions and would always make sure we had everything we needed! She even received a package we had ordered online while we were out doing groceries!\r\n\r\nThe appartment is a little far from manhattan, but nothing undoable! It was either on express bus (6.50$\r\n) or the bus (2.75$) and a metro ride (3$). Both would usually take about an hour (make sure you have spare change or just get a weekly pass for 31$).\r\n\r\nWe enjoyed the neighbourhood and would definetly rebook if ever we come back to NYC! Great place for a little price!

Secondly, Natasha provides everything from plates, bowls, utensils, towels, and even toiletries, you will have nothing to worry about except for relaxing on the comfy bed. Thirdly, its absolutely secluded from the rest of the house. Natasha gave us the utmost privacy and made herself available, if we needed it. We never had to contact her, that's how seamless this stay was. Finally, keyless entry. We came and went as we please without worrying about how to check-in or coming and going.

Otherwise, Natasha’s place was clean and cozy. The communication was very fast, making our stay just awesome.

But here were the problems.  Shortly after we arrived, we discovered the toilet wasn't flushing properly.  Called the host and left apartment to go sightseeing.  He texted that it was fixed.  It was not .  Had to leave back cover off toilet and reach in to tank to push down flapper every time we needed to flush toilet.  Then that evening, we discovered that the street traffic was unbearably loud and that there was a bus stop right below the bedroom window.  Every time the bus stopped, we heard the hydraulics of the bus, the door open, then the passengers getting out talking loudly.  It was virtually impossible to sleep.   Sounded like bus stop was in our bedroom.  In the middle of the night we moved to the most interior bedroom, which helped slightly with the street noise, but the twin beds were small, with four inch mattresses, and no box springs.  Not really appropriate for two adults.  the middle bedroom was not an option as there were only sheets, no comforter, on the bed.  And again the double bed had no box spring  The wifi was only usable in one room.  We think because it must have been shared with the medical office on first floor.   The host cannot be faulted of all of these problems, but I think future airbnb clients should know that you cannot sleep in this apartment.  This experience was really disappointing, particularly in light of how expensive this listing was.  We could have stayed in a four star hotel for what we paid for this rental"},{"_id":"104164361","date":{"$date":"2016-09-25T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14968000","reviewer_id":"2238652","reviewer_name":"Matt","comments":"The apartment is in a pleasant area in Park Slope and has everything you'd need for a group of people.

It does get a little noisy from traffics, sirens, etc. at night and in the early morning, but I think that's typical for the city and something that folks should be prepared for it they are staying in the area. Location was great and easy to access food, transportation, etc.  Saif responded to the feedback re: having more toilet paper available which was greatly appreciated.

The apartment is in an older building so although it is dated, it is clean.  It is within walking distance to some really great restaurants delis and shops.  The price was very reasonable for the space and location.  There was not sufficient dishware to accommodate more than 3 to 4 people.  Several window blinds were not operable which could compromise privacy and several lights were out including the one right outside the apartment so when dark it was a challenge to unlock the door plus a little unnerving having that particular light out when alone.  If you are not used to the city noises, you may find sleep is difficult at night especially when the garbage crew is cleaning up.  Saif was very responsive throughout the entire process and stay even texting me back within minutes of a very late text (apologies for that)  regarding password for internet (inaccurate one given as to case sensitivity) so I could get some work completed.

However the setup is better suited for post college kids on a budget. The blinds on the windows are either too short or broken/crooked. The freezer on the refrigerator can’t open unless you tilt it away from the wall because it is jammed against the light switch. Even though it can sleep 6 there are only enough dishes for 3-4 people; same for the silverware. One of the kitchen chairs was missing screws making it dangerous - again only seats for 4. The toilet was “repaired” twice while we were there - only to have it stop flushing yet again. We had to use McDonald’s, Dunkin Donuts and a local bar to go to the bathroom. On the second day the downstairs office bathroom was available to us. To their credit the host refunded half the stay.

Lasty, I was disappointed with the lack of upkeep regarding the white sheets and pillow cases which were stained, the old dirty pillows and the dirty shower curtain.

Sugerimos comprar talheres  e panelas novos, pois os talheres são muito antigos e até enferrujados. Sugerimos também colocar os talheres em um recipiente próprio e não jogados na gaveta. As panelas estão velhas, sem o teflon. Sugerimos trocá-las. Os ar condicionados anunciados não funcionam. Isso é grave pois comprometeu a qualidade do nosso sono. A iluminação dos quartos não é adequada, feita somente por abajures.

With the windows open it could be a  bit noisy, but when they are closed it was very quiet so it was not an issue! Having the metro so close made traveling the city very easy. The biggest challenge was parking, if you plan to have a car your only decent overnight options require you to walk quite a bit.

He always was rather enthusiastic about us coming, very welcoming. He made it very easy to communicate once we landed, between him and my fiancée Izadora, we were added to the group chat on \" (Hidden by Airbnb) \"! Upon our arrival, Vítor was awaiting us at the door (very helpful since it was already night fall). From that moment, he broke it all down from which key opens what door, where we could park our rental car, and to where we could wash off sand from the beach before entering the building. All easy and in sequence. Once we got to the apartment, we were greeted by Carlos, the other guests, and their senior puppy (very cute)! We felt right at home! After brief intros, we were shown to our room (just as it appeared in the photos, if not better)! I personally was very touched by the (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) champagne flutes with a miniature bottle of champagne for two that sat along with the rest of our little toiletries and snacks! \r\nThe purpose of our stay was to experience New Years in Rio so it was a great gesture of hospitality! \r\nHe gave us the run down on the rest of the place, told us to be at home. \r\nWe were given wonderful recommendations on places we could visit that may appeal, whether it be for food or sights. It seemed like Vítor and Carlos had an answer to our every question! \r\nAgain, our primary objective was New Years, and as we scrambled to figure out what to do prior to visiting the beach, we were invited to spend the hours leading up to midnight, to hang out with our hosts and another great couple staying also, sipping cocktails and champagne and eating delicious fingerfoods prepared by Carlos! With about 45 minutes left of the night, we all strolled down the street to appear at one end of the Copacabana beach strip. It felt like an episode of \"Friends\". We were all together for the fireworks, photos were taken and toasts were made! Eventually our group split into 3 groups and separated. It just felt like a very homey experience as well as something completely new! \r\nThe location is everything! We were staying for 2 weeks; so when not driving, it was very helpful to be in the heart of so much. Taxis and buses cruising always, metro station 2 blocks away, a parking garage a few businesses down, Ipanema Beach Just 3 blocks in one direction, Copacabana Beach about a 15 minute walk in another direction. Grocery stores, clothing stores, abundance of food and bars, you name it! You simply cannot go wrong here even if you tried.

He's answering very quickly to questions you might have, he's very attentive and a lovely person. In your room you will find an umbrella for the beach, candies, earplugs and sleeping mask. \nThe location of the apartment is perfectly located in Ipanema, close to restaurants, metro station, beach, lagoon and shops. The wifi was also very good working and they have a washing machine in the apartment. The apartment was very clean and the kitchen is very well equipped. Only thing is that if you have the window opened, you can hear the noise from the street, but for that you can use the earplugs and I guess in summer time you anyway would keep the window closed and use the aircon.

Vitor is 5 star in communication with client concerns ( I ask about a issue.. he's there in 5 minutes or less).  I asked about a special guide who could share with me knowledge of yoga studios, massages, and overall Brazilian culture and he was able to suggest to me a local Airbnb host who could point me in those directions.  Airbnb is a marvel of travel opportunity.. discovery of real places, real people, and positive world peace experiences.  Go to Brazil and rent a place at Vitor's and save enough money so you can paraglide off a cliff (one of the many activities Rio has to offer).\n\n"},{"_id":"166455709","date":{"$date":"2017-07-03T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14996051","reviewer_id":"101826379","reviewer_name":"Darliana","comments":"O apartamento fica no melhor local da cidade, tem tudo perto e o Vitor é sempre muito solicito e disposto a auxiliar.

I chose this spot because they are superhosts and it was my first time in Rio. I didn’t want to be alone in the  big city. It was the right choice. Carlos doesn’t speak English so I mostly communicated with Vittor and he is lovely, caring and super helpful. The room is super comfortable and the apartment is in the heart of Ipanema which is an awesome area to have as a home base. The bedroom is located right on the street which I loved because I felt like I was part of the action. It was also kind of cool to interact with other guests, through Vittor our unofficial translator. I would definitely recommend this place especially if you are not familiar with Rio and because they are such nice people to stay with."},{"_id":"265850252","date":{"$date":"2018-05-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14996051","reviewer_id":"8582674","reviewer_name":"Suman","comments":"Vitor \u0026 Carlos's place was a great stay and are excellent hosts.

It is in the PERFECT location, in one of the hip areas in Rio, with a 3-5 minute walk to the beach. It was so convenient! Ipanema is the perfect mix of a residential and commercial neighborhood - stores around in case you want to buy a shirt, medicine or need to take out cash. There are several food options in the area as well, which was great for breakfast and late night açaí snack.  Our room was facing the Main Street, which we really liked.

There are 2 AC units 1 above the queen bed and the other in the living space; 3 ceiling fans, 1 above the queen bed, 1 living space and 1 in the bathroom. pots/pans/coffee maker/rice cooker/oil/salt\u0026pepper/ dishwashing soap/shampoo/conditioner/bodywash/towels provided. We had breakfast at the studio and I would pack a light lunch/snacks/fruits for the beach.There's a grill outside which we used as well. Only 5-10min drive to Lanikai beach which is great for young kids. EVERYTHING was PERFECT. We would definitely come back and stay at Laura's place.

The walk to the beach is minimal (5-10 minutes tops).  This area of Kailua Beach is awesome, especially during the week as there are usually less people than down by the beach park.  Laura greeted us with a smile and then gave us 100% privacy.  The few times we saw each other in passing, she was exceptionally nice and again, always smiling.

The kitchen was ready for us to use, with dishes, flatware, glasses and all we needed. Laura also has a small desk which was great for the lap top, and a power strip big enough for our multiple electronic devices. She also has a large fan which could be moved where needed. We felt very comfortable and at home, and Laura was readily available and very responsive to any questions. \n\nThe beach was within easy walking distance.

However, the kitchen tools are pretty limited, as is the beach gear, so I suggest you ask if you plan to rely on specific items for either cooking or beach outings. Check-in was easy and there is off-street parking, which is nice. The proximity to the beach is excellent - about an 8 to 10-minute walk.

The walk to the beach was short, though you do have to cross a couple roads and there's no crosswalks. At certain times of day you had to wait a while to find a break in traffic to cross.\n\nThe booklet in the room with local tips was very helpful.\n\nOverall a great stay."},{"_id":"360797220","date":{"$date":"2018-12-21T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"14996590","reviewer_id":"57880730","reviewer_name":"Becky","comments":"Everything was great at Laura's place!

Filipa nous disait que la restauration de l'immeuble a été fait par un architecte et cela se voit dans tous les détails. Il y a même un rideau électrique qui descend pour plus d'intimité à la mezzanine si on vient entre amis. C'est un peu humide à cause des murs de pierres et un peu sombre mais il y a des lumières partout et l'ambiance est incroyable. Nous le recommandons vivement! L'emplacement est idéal.

Je ne vous recommande pas de booker cet appartement quand il fait froid en revanche, car le chauffage n'est pas très performant et les problèmes d'humidité se font sentir. Mais il parait qu'il n'y a pas beaucoup d'appartements qui sont bien chauffés à Porto. Nous aurions souhaité profiter de la terrasse mais il faisait assez froid pour petit-déjeuner dehors.

The condo stayed comfortably cool with air conditioners as well as overhead fans in both the living room and the bedroom.  There was a king-sized bed in the main  bedroom with a pull-out sofa in the living room, comfortably accomodating 3 adults.  We enjoyed having a washer and dryer in the condo as well. We have stayed at condos on other Hawaiian islands and this was by far the cleanest and most up-to-date. The location was perfect, in a gated community at the Turtle Bay Resort.

She's very quick to reply with any questions or problems. Checking in and out was a breeze. We had a very late flight home and she allowed my family and I a late check out. The home is just as pictured!\n\nThe location is about 30mins from OGG airport but close proximity to restaurants, night life, shopping, and the BEACH! We spent a lot of time on Front St which is roughly 5 miles away. The home does not have AC but going the first week in December wasn't too bad. With the ocean close by it provided a nice breeze thru the windows. \n\nWe had little children with us and Leah's home is a two story house with an open wooden staircase so be very careful. Also there is a strict rule - quiet time is btw 10pm - 8am. The area is located in a very quiet and private residence so during quiet time, the littlest noise can be heard.

Many reviews talked about the strict rules and they weren’t kidding! We are rule followers who had a 7, 5 and 3 year old with us and thought the quiet rules would be perfect.  However, it was ridiculously overboard and we wouldn’t stay there again because of those rules.  We had to whisper at the pool and when one of my kids spoke in a regular voice, we were told we need to be quiet by a resident. Another day the manager rang our doorbell at 7:30am because he had complaints the day before and assumed it was us (though we were away the whole day).  It was hotter than usual when we were there, and just a reminder there is no a/c and it is a tropical island...we had more bugs than we were okay with (not sure the house gets sprayed for them)."},{"_id":"348431784","date":{"$date":"2018-11-13T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15021236","reviewer_id":"44679148","reviewer_name":"Erika","comments":"Perfect location !

Felt more like a 5 star hotel room than an affordable Airbnb location. The room has its own entrance with access to the street as well as a private shower and toilet room. You can bar the access from the rest of the house for extra privacy. There's also a fish tank to stare at to help you relax.

The door is armoured so there's a 100% assured safety (even though Porto doesn't have any crime, but maybe this can get that concern covered). There's a Lidl right across the street, which is great.\n\nIt's rather far from the center so it takes around 40 minutes on foot, but bus 600 takes you from the corner of the street right to the center in under 15 minutes. There are plenty other buses to get to most places in the city.

The apartment is clean, you don't hear noises from the neighbors at all, the beds are comfortable, and it has wifi! Do understand that this is an apartment in a building of full-time residences, in an old neighborhood of Barcelona.  I sincerely enjoyed that aspect of our experience, and would readily stay here again. Do expect a nice, comfortable place to stay that welcomes you back at the end of a long day exploring a great city!\n\nIn all, this is a great value. Instead of coffee delivered to your room, roll down to the shop on the corner in the morning for a cafe and pastry.  One of our two best meals was in a restaurant literally right across from the front door of our building ( I would suggest staying away from the restaurants in the Placa Reial.  Everytime you walk through, you are propositioned for a meal, and the best rated on Yelp was just okay. Instead, look out the front as mentioned above, or turn right when leaving the building and explore all the great little avenues with many restaurant options.

Sound must carry or they have sensitive neighbors as we had complaints the first two nights and were asked to leave on the third. On the first night we were casually watching television at a reasonable volume, which apparently prompted a complaint however we were never notified by David. If we had of been notified we certainly would have been extremely careful but weren’t given the opportunity. On night two we played music at what we considered a normal respectful volume, but clearly that wasn’t the case. Our group was comprised of Courteaus, young professionals and would have never played any sort of music (or surprisingly television for that matter) if we had of known how sensitive the neighbors were.

It's just steps from Placa Reial and La Rambla.  It's an easy walk to the Museu Picasso.  There is so much to do and see just outside, but none of it can be heard from inside the apartment which is great for sleeping in after a late night out of dancing!  It's surprisingly open and breezy too with nice natural light and a balcony off the living room and master bedroom. \n\nRecommend packing light and taking advantage of the washer inside the apartment.  There were steel hangers available to hang dry essentials, which were dry by morning. There are also several laundry mats just outside if wanting to use a dryer. We took one under-seat sized roller bag for each person in our party and a handbag or shoulder bag/backpack and still had more than what we needed, even including formal wear.  Best of all, it was so easy to get around (taxi, metro, small elevator, or carry up stairs, etc.). We left room to buy a souvenir bag to pack full for gifts and never had to wait for checked bags as all were carry on size, even for the smaller commuter flights between countries. \n\nOur hosts recommended restaurants and markets nearby.  We loved the Tapeo Bar and La Quinze Nits!  All were a terrific value!  We also recommend the free walking tour from Barcelona Excursions early in the trip for other fantastic insights to this location. Also worthy of mentioning, we were lucky to be able to see Flamenco at Palau de la Musica – so beautiful that we wanted to cry!\n\nThank you, David and David, for everything!!"},{"_id":"299537570","date":{"$date":"2018-07-31T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15047479","reviewer_id":"30318202","reviewer_name":"Christian","comments":"Great location.

We have never had such a helpful Airbnb host in all of our many stays through Airbnb. He was easy and quick to communicate with, very helpful with any questions we had, and went above and beyond to make sure we enjoyed our stay! We were beyond impressed with his hospitality and effort to make our stay in Barcelona the best it could be.\n\nThe flat was a generous size for our family of five that includes three young children. It was great to have two separate bathrooms, and all the beds were comfortable. We thought it was a great value for money. It was in the perfect spot to get to all of the attractions we wanted to visit (aquarium, zoo, etc), but also very close to Las Ramblas/touristy area, which I didn't find as charming.\n\nThe only thing that I wish I would have realized is that the flat is up 4 levels of stairs (this is likely listed in the description/mentioned in reviews and I probably missed it!). There is a lift, but it was out of order on the bottom level; and even the bottom level requires you to walk up one set of stairs. Something to consider if you are traveling with a pram or small children!"},{"_id":"348299536","date":{"$date":"2018-11-13T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15047479","reviewer_id":"43676774","reviewer_name":"Chris","comments":"Excellent location, would definitely stay there again and recommend highly.

Its tucked in a sleepy suburb right next to the beach and was great for watching the sunrise. Found some really cool hikes nearby, especially Makaua falls trail right down the street that became one of the unexpected gems on our trip (really fun bouldering!).

Make sure to bring or purchase bug spray though since there are quite a few mosquitos flying around the area. I would suggest to rent a car, although the bus service seems to be pretty great, because the treehouse is a 40 minute drive from the airport. It's also about a 40 minute drive to Waimea Bay which is an amazing beach and snorkelling spot that you must check out while staying at Doug's place. Doug has a little hand drawn map inside that tells you about some great hiking spots as well which is a bonus, and one of the cool hikes is basically in the back yard!"},{"_id":"162663848","date":{"$date":"2017-06-21T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15088513","reviewer_id":"84820765","reviewer_name":"Gene","comments":"It's a nice place if you are willing to climb the stairs for the sleep at night and get down the stairs and walk to the neighbor house each time you want to go to a restroom.

It wasn't an issue for me because I've been camping before, it's something you expect. No a/c inside, has a fan upstairs in the bedroom, which during the day it was needed but not so much at night. Has an amazing view of the mountains as you sit outside on the patio chair, siting under a fruit tree while spending some company with the roaming chickens! I didn't spend lots of time at the tree house. Location is great, I've spent lots of my time at Kaaawa beach which is a 5 minute walk. The tree house is 2 blocks away from main highway and bus stops, and a 5 minute walk from a 7-11 which is a lifesaver for food, drinks, and snacks!!! (not many food spots nearby)... It's about 1 hour bus ride to Waimea Bay Beach and a little over 1 hour bus ride to Ala Moana Center. I stayed here mainly because I attended the Spartan Race Hawaii Weekend at Kualoa Ranch which was a little over 2 miles away..... Overall, this place was perfect for me due to its location, size of the tree house, and price for my stay. The host, Doug, usually answers you back promptly if you have any questions and he is a great source to ask for recommendations on what to do while your in Hawaii. My first time here was amazing and I can't wait to come back!"},{"_id":"186890270","date":{"$date":"2017-08-25T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15088513","reviewer_id":"146563793","reviewer_name":"Marilu","comments":"This house was not only terrible but the photos he posted were not realistic at all.

However, due to unforeseen circumstances, I had to find a place for the weekend - Pablo's Airbnb was one of the few options available, affordable, and accessible to me.\n\nLocation: traveling from the Upper East in Manhattan to Fordham in the Bronx was quite the commute, but not entirely too bad. Both the D train and 6 train had stops just 2-3 blocks away.\n\nAccommodations: the listing is in an apartment complex right off the main road, so it's quite busy outside and people can get a little loud (including the neighbor upstairs that likes to play music)."}]}

The quality of the place is very high - it is nicely designed, in a great location, well taken care of, and I found it quite comfortable. I loved the feeling of being in the middle of Hong Kong when you step out of the door and the fact that it is a modern apartment but in an older building means that it is comfortable, yet feels very local. The size is really small, but the way the space is used is very clever.\n\nThere are multiple units and not all of them seem to have windows.

Él fue un excelente host pero la habitación es algo ruidosa. Hay un motor exterior que funciona las 24hs y yo soy particularmente sensible a los ruidos. También se escuchaban pisadas del departamento superior pero yo no estoy acostumbrada a vivir en edificio tampoco. El wifi por las mañanas no funcionaba muy bien, tardaba en conectar, pero fuera de eso, el departamento es cómodo, pequeño pero perfectamente equipado.

Also the gas was off for the entire building so we weren't able to cook our own food, this wasn't a big deal as you could order in and there were a lot of local places to eat - just maybe made it a little more expensive. Overall its the fact that the building is old and so these problems are more likely in an old apartment.\n\nClark was brilliant through the stay, we were always able to contact him day or night and he was attentive, tried to fix the leak as soon as it occurred and let us keep our bags at the property over the checkout time (as we had a late flight back to the UK). \n\nOverall good for the price."},{"_id":"230940074","date":{"$date":"2018-01-29T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15115143","reviewer_id":"41238147","reviewer_name":"Emilia","comments":"Fantastic place!

We had a small hiccup at check-in, but it was resolved within a few minutes, and we were able to get our keys. The apartment was spacious, clean, and had everything we needed. Most importantly, we felt very safe there and walking in the area. The only things to be aware of - the two flights of stairs up to the apartment are a little slanted and feel a bit like a fun house, so keep that in mind if you have issues with stairs. There are also very hot pipes running in the apartment that don't have any warning stickers, so they could easily burn a child or someone that might accidentally touch them.

The apartment is brand new. Everything is finished to a high standard and extremely tidy and comfortable. The outdoor deck was a lovely space to relax and eat dinner and the private beach at the end of the street is beyond perfect... This was our final air bnb stop after 3 months of travels and one of the best by far.

The studio is beautiful, and has everything you could need to feel like a home away from home.  It's steps from a beautiful secluded beach, which we enjoyed with the snorkeling and beach gear that Kelly provides for the use of her guests.\n\nThe \"studio\" itself is really a large one-bedroom apartment with a separate entry and is completely private, and is larger than even the pictures make it seem.  We thoroughly enjoyed the private yard and lanai, and used both the grill and kitchen to prepare our breakfast and dinner regularly throughout our stay.  They even allow use of an on-site washer and dryer which was hugely helpful given we were mid-way through our vacation.\n\nThe location in the north shore is amazing, and just a short drive from Haleiwa which has some great stores and restaurants, and not far from Waimea Bay and some amazing beaches, and is a short, 40 minute drive from Honolulu.\n\nKelly offered great tips about local hikes and places to visit, and was very helpful when asked.  We briefly bumped into her husband and son as well who were very friendly and offered some great tips as well.\n\nI can't recommend the studio or hosts enough.

Pessoalmente, estive com ela apenas uma vez - há bastante privacidade na casa, apesar dela residir com a família no segundo andar. \n\nA casa é ainda melhor que nas fotos. Localização é ok, fica a cerca de 10-15 minutos de Haleiwa e das principais praias do North Shore. Como em qualquer local na área norte da ilha, é necessário um carro alugado! Há quase tudo que um casal ou uma família pequena precisa na casa, exceção de um forno convencional (fez um pouco de falta para a famosa pizza congelada, mas sem traumas...). O colchão do sofá-cama também não é, como esperado nesses casos, dos melhores. De resto, tudo muito bom! Equipamentos modernos, cafeteira, torradeira, mini fogão, geladeira e ar condicionado no quarto, além\nde muitos utensílios na cozinha. Kelly também deixou cadeiras de praia, toalhas e equipamento para snorkel à disposição.

We went to this beach twice a day everyday and every night at sunset we watched turtles swim past and one night a turtle even came up on the sand to join us! Kelly’s place allowed us to have an amazing Hawaii north shore experience and I would recommend it to anyone.

You are almost at the end of the North Shore, as far from the city (Honolulu) as possible, but only a 10 minute drive to the charming town of Haleiwa where there are tourist shops, a couple of banks, Matsamoto’s Shaved Ice and a good supermarket. And when you want or need to go into the city, it’s no more than an hour drive on the freeway to anywhere in Honolulu. But the feeling there is similar to being on an outer Island. You are next to rustic, pristine beaches that stretch for miles and near world famous surfing beaches. You will see green mountains behind you, hang gliders coming in for landings nearby and rainbow filled skies. The guest house itself is thoughtfully designed, tastefully furnished and very comfortable. Kelly thought of just about everything a traveler would want. She is also an excellent communicator so any issue that might come up is taken care of quickly. If you would like to experience Oahu from a different but very fresh perspective, you cannot go wrong selecting Kelly’s guest house.

The living space is quite large (especially after a few days in a very small condo in Waikiki). Kelly provided items such as a coffee grinder at our request, and gave local recommendations. The local beach access is nice for taking a little walk and taking a dip in the ocean. I recommend the local Kealia hike (moderately strenuous) and Ka'ena Point Nature Reserve. And observing the skydivers from the airfield or the beach, and the stars at night. Of course, we also drove to other attractions on Oahu-- try to gauge the traffic, which can be heavy.  The only negatives for us were that the mattress was somewhat on the soft side for us, but that's a matter of personal preference and my wife and I do have back issues... Also, though it was mostly very quiet, local fellas drove by on the main road with booming music on a few nights; one should always travel with earplugs. All in all, a super stay with great hosts.

Desde o princípio fez-nos sentir como visitas indesejadas em sua casa: se íamos a cozinha, ia atrás para conferir o que estávamos fazendo; se brincávamos com os animais, nos dirigia olhares de reprovação e os afastava de nós; se dormíamos até mais tarde, censurava-nos com comentários sobre o nosso turismo. Nunca em minhas viagens me senti tão mal em um lugar. Manuela acordava 7h da manhã e começava a limpar a casa cantando em alto e bom som, mas não teve problemas em gritar conosco quando rimos brincando com os animais às 23h. Não há chave no quarto, e Manuela entra neste assim que deixamos a casa para passear (e envia mensagens reclamando que fechamos a janela do quarto). Não temos acesso algum a sala, se demoramos no banheiro ouvimos batidas/gritos e nos restringimos a guardar as coisas na geladeira. Usamos 1 prato e o deixamos no quarto para lavar depois que chegássemos e Manuela, entrando no quarto na sua bisbilhotagem diária, mandou mensagem reclamando sobre isso. Na última noite, mandou uma mensagem mal educada nos AVISANDO que deveríamos sair do quarto antes do meio dia. Péssima estádia, péssima pessoa e péssimo host. Não recomendo de maneira nenhuma."}]}

Cheguei um pouco tarde (23h) e carinhosamente ela me mostrou o funcionamento da casa, da cozinha, reservou um espaço no refrigerador, me deixou super a vontade. Recebi uma cópia da chave e entrava e saída do apartamento, e pouco permanecia no apartamento em função de minhas atividades no Rio. Saía para conhecer a noite carioca e voltava de madrugada, sem problemas nenhum (claro que mantive o respeito e cheguava de forma bem discreta e silenciosa). Dormi até tarde e a sensação que tinha é que parecia que estava sozinho. O apartamento fica no coração de Copa, mega silencioso, fresco, bem próximo a tudo o que se eu precisei: praia, restaurantes, farmácias, ponto de ônibus e metrô. Foi uma experiência fantástica e super recomendo o apartamento do Lereno e sua família. Todas as vezes que for ao RJ, e  tiver disponibilidade, com certeza ficarei hospedado nesta casa maravilhosa, onde a energia e o conforto são evidentes. Obrigado ao pai e mãe do Lereno que me deixaram tão a vontade, que às vezes parecia eu estar em casa!"},{"_id":"128272298","date":{"$date":"2017-01-23T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15126808","reviewer_id":"943691","reviewer_name":"Sophie","comments":"코파카바나 해변과 멀지 않고 쇼핑몰까지 가는 셔틀버스 정류장도 가깝고 지하철이나 버스도 잘 되어있어서 아주 좋았습니다."},{"_id":"129938051","date":{"$date":"2017-02-03T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15126808","reviewer_id":"113219831","reviewer_name":"Maurício","comments":"Como minha primeira experiência no airbnb, foi boa: anfitrião gentil e atencioso, cujos pais são também muito simpáticos, quarto com muito boa ventilação, sol da manhã, pertinho da praia, enfim, gostei!"},{"_id":"133935784","date":{"$date":"2017-02-25T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15126808","reviewer_id":"56121700","reviewer_name":"Heloisa","comments":"A minha hospedagem no apartamento do Lereno foi muito agradável, local próximo a tudo que precisei, limpeza ótima, local seguro do jeitinho que mostram as fotos, quarto bem arejado, e a família acolhedora que me deixou bem a vontade.

Muito frequentada pelos moradores da Zona Sul do Rio e da Barra, o local tem número cada vez maior de visitantes estrangeiros também por conta de seus vários atrativos e pelo fato de ser considerado hoje o local mais seguro do Rio para se transitar à noite, com equipe da Guarda Municipal dedicada à região.

The location is in a friendly neighbourhood and the houses are very close together. I can well understand why it would not be suitable for parties or large get-togethers.

The garage was great too, as we had rented a fairly big jeep and there was plenty of room and was really spacious. \n\nWe never had the chance to meet Nina in person, but our written communication was excellent. Her response was quick and reliable. \n\nIf I had to give a constructive criticism, it would be 2 small issues.  One, because we always returned back to the house at night, we had to always turn on our flashlight in order to lead us safely up the path to the stairs where the main entrance was located. Perhaps one more motion detector light would be nice. Secondly, we were too incompetent to use the television, meaning not user-friendly.

We could not see or hear the ocean from this home but we did hear beautiful birds each morning.  The bedrooms are clean and comfortable.  The bathrooms are both located in the hall and do not join to any bedrooms.  This made it quite awkward for sharing space with the couple we traveled with.  One shower is its own room.  You have to change your clothes directly in the shower.  The toilet is in a room separate from this shower.  We were able to work it out, but it was rather uncomfortable.\nWe loved the lanai and the beautiful, well manicured grounds. The air around Palm Tree House smells like flowers.  Nina was very helpful.  We had a difficult time cooling the place down when we first arrived, but she patiently explained the ceiling fans (there is no a/c).  When there were cross-breezes it was quite comfortable.  \nWe appreciated being able to use the body boards and beach chairs.  We found the best waves near Laie (North Shore)  The waves at the beach near Palm Tree House were very gentle and relaxing. We were told that the waves were in \"hibernation\" during our trip in early June (I'm not sure if this is a common thing or not.)\nOur favorite places on North Shore were Haleiwa (kayaking, shaved ice, food trucks, cute shops, Ted's Pies at the grocery store), Polynesian Cultural Center (the best experience/show of the entire trip),  and Hukilau Beach (awesome waves!).  \nOverall, Palm Tree House is a great place for relaxing at the end of an exciting day.  Thank you Nina!"},{"_id":"168983511","date":{"$date":"2017-07-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15167619","reviewer_id":"111751564","reviewer_name":"Jawalkerpe","comments":"Nice place a little warm in July"},{"_id":"177147193","date":{"$date":"2017-08-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15167619","reviewer_id":"129691724","reviewer_name":"Chris","comments":"The house is very clean, well equipped and in a great location.

Haleiwa is a very short drive, offering larger puclic parks/beaches as well as a wide variety of dining and shopping.  The location provides a getaway from the extremely busy/touristy area of Waikiki as well as close proximity to the beautiful north shore.

We would recommend Surf N Salsa food truck in Haleiwa, Impossibles Pizza in Pupukea, or stopping by Costco and making dinner to bring to the beach.

We also spent a day at Waikiki beach and Pearl Harbor.  We stopped twice at the Dole plantation for delicious dole whip and explored the shops and farmer’s market in Wailua, be sure to check out the laid back coffee and chocolate tour at the local roasting company. Most days we walked around the block to the beach to watch the sunset and watch the turtles feed along the shore.\nThe World Cup started during our trip and we were able to record all the games we wanted on the DVR and watch them during breakfast, that made us very happy!\nThank you Nina for such a welcoming and wonderful stay, it is a trip we will never forget!"},{"_id":"292767546","date":{"$date":"2018-07-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15167619","reviewer_id":"268985","reviewer_name":"Pippi -","comments":"This house is lovely and Nina is truly a fantastic host.   The house is in a great location as the bus line goes right by the house, a bike path is also nearby, so it was easy to get around without a car.  The only drawback, and this is of no fault of the host and I doubt she could do anything about it, but the neighbor's dogs (across the street) bark incessantly at times which was a bit maddening.  But I had to spend a lot of time working remotely each day and most guests probably won't spend that much time in the house so hopefully it won't be an issue.   This is a great place and I would certainly recommend it to anyone wanting to stay in a Waialua.

Utilizamos a vaga de garagem gratuitamente e a equipe do edifício foi sempre muito solícita e atenciosa. Carolina e seu marido nos receberam com muito carinho, deixaram água gelada e gelo já à disposição, balinhas, toalhas e todo o tipo de conforto possível. Nos sentimos em casa nestes dias, pudemos até assistir o jogo do nosso time na libertadores graças à Tv à cabo. Só posso recomendar fortemente este apartamento e agradecer à Carolina pela excelente hospedagem."},{"_id":"139812514","date":{"$date":"2017-03-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15177216","reviewer_id":"24494020","reviewer_name":"Cláudia","comments":"O apartamento é exatamente como demonstrado nas fotos do anuncio. Espaçoso, confortável e com ótimo custo benefício! Excelente para casais com ou sem filhos. A localização é ótima! Próximo a vários supermercados, restaurantes, bares, farmácias, lojas e, claro, das praias. Para quem gosta de uma caminhada tranquila na orla, é possível ir à pé também para outras praias fora de Copacabana, como Leme, Arpoador e Ipanema. Não gastamos mais do que 5 minutos de caminhada para chegar à estação do metrô (Siqueira Campos)! A proprietária é muita simpática, educada e sempre solícita!

There are restaurants, coffe shops and groceries all around. You can easily get there by feet, and also transportation is not far. Visit the original Williamsburg. It's a 15 minutes walk but it's worth all the shopping, restaurants and coffe shops you need. You can also visit the artists area that is very close.

The check-in was very easy and smooth and Lawrence was immediately responsive to all our requests. He had also stocked the kitchen with bottled water and beer for us, which I thought was so nice! He was very concerned that we have a good stay. The only couple of things I might say that I wish were different were that one, we couldn't control the heat ourselves and it made climate control a little challenging sometimes (we had to text or call Lawrence to change it for us), and two, the internet was kind of spotty (probably normal for a basement apartment).

He provided amenities such as water, coffees, towels, dishware, and an extra set of keys. He also gave great recommendations! \n\nThe apartment is in a great location and surrounded by many restaurants, delis, and convenience stores. It was about a 10 min walk to the G and L trains. It is a basement apartment so those with a lot of luggage or sensitive to stairs should take note. It’s only a few steps but is tight in typical Brooklyn fashion. The apartment itself is spacious, with 2 bedrooms, a large living/dining area with a bed in it, a bathroom, kitchen, and patio space. We didn’t use the patio space much because it seemed shared. The kitchen is also a bit separate from the rest of the place in the back of the apartment which made the space feel large. We loved the open floor open of the living/dining room. \n\nOne thing to note was that due to the lack of windows (basement apartment), there was very little air flow and at times the apartment felt stuffy. Lawrence provides an AC unit and you can keep one of the doors unlocked to let in air, but the AC wasn’t sufficient during our stay. Thankfully we weren’t home for long periods, but with 6 of us in the space it got warm.\n\nOverall, we really enjoyed our stay in this Williamsburg apartment!

It’s equipped with everything you need; comfortable furniture, new dishes, linens, towels, household chemicals. A small negative thing - during our stay it was a little cold, but Marcos prudently showed where to get warm blankets. Marcos gave advice and tips what to visit and tried to help us in every way. On my sister’s birthday he offered to call to the restaurant and to ask them to do something like a birthday cake with candles, it was so cute! We were very happy with the choice.

Wij hebben vrijwel alles gelopen, en binnen een half uur stonden we op het strand/ op de Rambla of elders waar we heen wilden.

A few steps outside the main entrance there is a small supermarket and then there is the big shopping mall over the street. About 80 meters down the road you can find an internet shop which we used to print out our tickets for the flight back.

It is a little out of the central part of the city, but we prefer this, as we prefer to be living amongst locals than tourists.  Marcos arranged for someone to meet us at the nearest train station, and walk us to the apartment, and was always on hand by mobile phone to ask questions.  We walked into the centre of the city several times .. it took about 45 minutes.  We walked to Port Forum in the north, which took about the same time.  At Port Forum there is a huge Decathlon store, but also a lovely restaurant on the marina front called Port Nautic where we had a fabulous Menu del Dia. Transport is cheap (one euro per trip per person) so we jumped on and off the Metro and tram regularly to get about.  Opposite the flat is a shopping centre, with supermarket which is very handy. My children loved the crepe / gelateria shop on the ground floor, and the lady there was very friendly.    We found a friendly bar in Pueblo Nou, just 10 minutes walk from the flat, which also served food.  The name is Brisas sin Prisa.  It is on the main Rambla, which is a lovely walk, particularly on an evening.  There is a really funny waiter there called Osam and he made us feel very welcome.  Barcelona is a wonderful city, very walkable, with lots to see and do, for all ages.  Our boys (12 and 13) loved the young feel of the city, and particularly enjoyed visiting Camp Nou to watch the Barca / Grenada match.  We stayed 5 nights and we really felt this was the right length of time.

Since there were 4 of us, we used taxi services to commute in and out of the city center. While the street was very busy, there weren't very many free taxis driving by the place so we needed to use a taxi app to hail one for most rides. If you're planning on using public transportation, the bus and metro stops were close by. The apartment itself was comfortable. The AC was nice to have as it got a little warm while we were there. The full kitchen and washing machine was also useful to us. The main complaint about the room's was the lack of real windows in the smaller rooms. They don't actually let in sunlight. Besides that, we had a nice stay in Barcelona.

Marcos quickly brought us a fan to help circulate the air as soon as we requested it.  \nThere is an ample supply of towels/linens which is appreciated and something we did not find to be provided in the other BnB’s in which we stayed in Spain.  Typically one bath towel and  maybe 1 hand towel per person no matter how long your stay. \nIf there are more than 2 in your group you will want to alternate showers at night and morning as hot water only lasts for 2 showers in the morning, then you need to wait 15-20 min. Good water pressure though. \nNice location but felt we were a 15 min cab ride from just about everything we wanted to do, due to traffic and construction in front of our building.   We found it easier to find a cab if we walked through the Glories mall to the far side by Gino’s.

Glories Metro is  5-7 mins walk, we bought the 10 journeys ticket for our 5 day stay, which was just over 30 euros for the 3 of us.     We walked to the beach in 25 mins, the best route is through Glories Shopping Centre, walk out with  McDonalds on your right, walk along Avinguda Diagonal for 2/3 mins to Rambla del Poblenou , which has many restaurants  all the way down to the beach.  We enjoyed a very good English breakfast near the start of Poblenou at Palo Verde on the left.  We also rented bikes along this road from Pedal Bike Rental which is near the first roundabout, there is a  Mercadona here also.   We used the Metro every day and found it very easy to use.

He is this natural born host. During my stay he threw a house party for all the people in the house and I could also invite a friend. The stay in the house is basically highly relaxing experience.

Sa maison est bien entretenue et très bien située dans une rue calme d' Harlem à proximité d'une ligne de métro menant très rapidement au coeur de Manhattan.\r\nLa chambre où j'ai dormi (semi-private room) présente l'inconvénient de n'être isolée de la cuisine et d'une pièce commune que par un paravent, ce qui ne permet pas toujours d'avoir un sommeil paisible. Par contre, elle est d'un prix attractif et s'avère calme lorsque les autres hôtes ne fréquentent pas trop les espaces communs. \r\nGlobalement, le bilan est donc positif et je conseille cette adresse, en privilégiant les chambres privées pour ceux qui prisent la tranquillité nocturne..\r\n"},{"_id":"2185192","date":{"$date":"2012-09-03T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"152259","reviewer_id":"1695563","reviewer_name":"J","comments":"I do recommend Wayne's place to stay.

However, his team helped me out, whenever I had a question. \nThe area of this room is a beautiful, family-friendly area in Harlem, about 4 blocks from the next subway, which was very handy. Safety concerns were completely out of place, even at night I never saw any sketchy people around. \nThe semi-private room is a bed in the general living room that is hidden behind screens in the corner. I didn't find it too loud at all to sleep there, if anything, it was the nearby staircase into the living room that made some noise. I didn't mind that, though, as it was always only early evening and morning, when there was some noise (and obviously I didn't come to NYC to sleep in till noon). \nThe house itself is a gorgious brick house with lots of floors and rooms, the kitchen is huge (and you can use that, too) and it even has a backyard. \nAll in all I found it a pleasant stay at Wayne's place, the price is very reasonable for New York standards (don't forget you're in Manhattan!).

But he was waiting for me patiently. He provided me a very comprehensive orientation about his place and neighborhood area, including restaurants and other stores. His location was particularly convenient access to my clients and business meetings in NYC.  His neighborhood was quiet and decent in the community of Harlem. I was a bit surprised to see so many restaurants near the area, even Japanese restaurants. (I am consulting for Japanese restaurant business.) Overall, I had a very positive experience at his place, and this was my first time stay using Airbnb. I will most likely return his place for my next trip to NYC in the middle of this July.

Vom JFK bin ich mit der Bahn angereist und weil ich aufgrund einer Verspätung meinen Anschlussflieger verpasst habe, bin ich erst um 3 Uhr Nachts bei Wayne abgenommen. Ich hatte ihm das aber von London aus geschrieben und er hat mir auch sofort geantwortet, das er den Schlüssel in einer Schlüsselbox für mich hinterlegt, und hat mir zu dieser den Code gegeben. Fand ich super. In der Nacht ist er dann sogar aufgestanden, als ich angekommen bin, und hat mir mein Bett gezeigt. Ich habe dann den Schlüssel für das Haus bekommen und konnte mich auf meine Entdeckungstour von New York begeben. Das war vom Haus aus auch sehr gut zu erledigen, da 2 Subway Stationen in der unmittelbaren Nähe sind mit denen man in nur wenigen Minuten direkt am Times Square sein kann, was ein immenser Vorteil ist. Das Internet bei ihm ist sehr schnell, was mir geholfen hat Mithilfe des Internets meine Tripps gut zu planen. Ich habe mich im Haus von Wayne sehr wohl gefühlt. Man kommt sich vor, als ob man bei einem guten alten Freund übernachtet. Er ist hilfsbereit wenn man Hilfe braucht, aber sonst sehr diskret. Ab und an mal, habe ich andere Gäste in der grossen Küche gesehen, die man auch benutzen kann, und wir haben uns gegenseitig über New York ausgetauscht, was man am besten wie besichtigt, aber da das Haus sehr groß ist, ist man sich sonst kaum über den Weg gelaufen. Es ist alles sehr sauber, was für mich mit am wichtigsten war. Das Bett was ich hatte, war in keinem abgetrennten separaten Zimmer, sondern in der hinteren Ecke des Wohnzimmers, das sollte man vor der Buchung wissen. Aber das hat mich persönlich nicht besonders gestört, weil ich eh den ganzen Tag unterwegs war. Dafür war mein Aufenthalt dort auch unheimlich günstig. Für wen das aber nichts ist, der kann bei Wayne aber auch ein normales Zimmer buchen, da er noch einige anbietet. Für den Zeitraum, für den ich gebucht hatte, waren die anderen Zimmer aber schon vermietet, so das mir nur dieses angeboten wurde. Was wie gesagt für mich voll in Ordnung ging, da ich immer sehr spät abends erst zurück gekommen bin von meinen Trips und morgens immer früh raus, da ich meine Zeit gut nutzen wollte. In der Nähe gibt es einen Supermarkt wo ihr alles einkaufen könnt was ihr braucht, falls ihr Zuhause frühstücken oder essen wollt. Die Sachen könnt ihr im Kühlschrank aufbewahren und auch wenn ihr mal Zuhause Verschnaufen wollt könnt ihr das im Wohnzimmer von Wayne bei guter Musik tun, alles kein Problem. Ich kann die Unterkunft nur wärmstens empfehlen. Wayne ist ein sehr guter Gastgeber, der einen sofort das Gefühl gibt, willkommen zu sein. Wir hatten uns auch einige male unterhalten und er ist ein wirklich netter, intelligenter und sozialer Mensch mit den Herzen an richtig Fleck.

The room hallway provides access to a small refrigerator, and to the washer and dryer.\n\nOne caution is that the house is on a hillside and the bedroom is one flight down.  Access to the house is on a short but steep slanted path to the steps.  So, if you have mobility issues, this may not be for you.\n"},{"_id":"114110719","date":{"$date":"2016-11-15T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15241263","reviewer_id":"98143438","reviewer_name":"Eiji","comments":"優しくて､親切で最高でした｡\r\nまた来たいです｡"},{"_id":"117245918","date":{"$date":"2016-12-05T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15241263","reviewer_id":"50921730","reviewer_name":"Shri","comments":"It's a great scenic place, over looking ocean and Diamond head.

Cleanliness was more than just 5 stars on top of high quality designer building material, decor, and even the toiletries! Bath and beach towels along with eco friendly tote bag were provided (separate fridge and water too!) The view was magnificent, and we tried to appreciate it as much as we could before leaving. Thank you again and we will be back :)"},{"_id":"208063907","date":{"$date":"2017-10-30T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15241263","reviewer_id":"156041692","reviewer_name":"Ziwei","comments":"非常好的一次体验,下次旅行还会选择mimi家"},{"_id":"208527650","date":{"$date":"2017-11-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15241263","reviewer_id":"41420480","reviewer_name":"依帆","comments":"房东很不错 他们的孩子和猫猫都很可爱 环境也非常舒适整洁"},{"_id":"210327209","date":{"$date":"2017-11-08T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15241263","reviewer_id":"37853626","reviewer_name":"Nancy","comments":"Great communication and check-in process.

The space is so cute and immaculately clean, which is so important to me when staying with hosts. They are quiet too so I never felt like there was any noise, but whenever I crossed paths with them, they’re very easy to talk to and have conversations with. Parking was not a problem at all and it’s quick to get to the highways, Diamond Head, and Waikiki. You’re close but not where it’s crowded with tourists. I enjoyed my stay with them and will definitely recommend their place to others and would stay again! Oh and I didn’t use the air conditioner either; I just used the fan and the room was nice and cool. They also offered for me to use the beach umbrella, chair, and bag which all came in handy because I lucked out with a couple of days of nice, sunny weather! Thank you Mimi, Norm, and Kayden!

Driving into the neighborhood up Wilhelmina Rise was an attraction itself. That steep climb showcased the amazing topography of Oahu, yet didn't feel like just a touristy thing to do. From there, we found other delightful spots that the locals frequented. In fact, those who stop in every day asked us how we knew about \"Coffee Talk\" because tourists do not typically find it. Mimi and Norm never led us astray with any of their suggestions for meals or places to experience! Another amazing feature of Mimi's Airbnb was the lanai with a view so spectacular that people back home asked, \"Where on earth are you that you captured those sunset pictures?\" When we climbed to the top of Diamondhead, we stood in awe of \"our\" neighborhood across the city. We have already told friends and family that this is just the place to stay when they travel to Oahu. Now that we've met Mimi and her delightful family, these new friends (including Purrcilla, the cat) beckon us back to another Aloha!"},{"_id":"343502999","date":{"$date":"2018-10-31T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15241263","reviewer_id":"197169482","reviewer_name":"Dai","comments":"My first Airbnb host that exceeded my expectations.

Ralph and Nancy’s place is conveniently and centrally located in a quiet part of the island. Walking distance from Maalaea Harbour which is great if you book any sea tours/excursions leaving from the harbour. Beautiful immaculate condo, cozy, very clean and well equipped. Quiet building and location. Easy and quick check-in, clear communication with the host who is quick to reply. Detailed instructions sent by email before our arrival were very helpful. Short drive to Kihei, Lahaina and Kahului Airport. Affordable and worth every penny. We will definitely return to Maui one day and hope to be able to stay here again."},{"_id":"257341007","date":{"$date":"2018-04-25T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15257124","reviewer_id":"106550148","reviewer_name":"Jacqui","comments":"Ralph's place is clean, modern, comfortable, and in a great location.

We had a fantastic week in Maui with Ma'alaea as our home base. Restaurants and shops and aquarium are walkable, and most of the spots on the island you want to be at are no more than 20 minutes away by car. We found the location so convenient and flexible, and were able to do everything we wanted. \n\nThe space is even nicer than it looks in the photos, immaculately kept and with everything you could want. It even has tons of goodies for cooking - salts and spices and even olive oil! The box of beach goodies - chairs, boogie boards, a cooler - were super handy and we used them a ton, saved us money too. \n\nIf you're worried about not having a beach view, don't be. The mountain view is gorgeous, and you can walk to the beach in minutes. \n\nMahalo, Ralph! We'd stay here again \u003c3"},{"_id":"275379545","date":{"$date":"2018-06-10T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15257124","reviewer_id":"118890176","reviewer_name":"Dylan","comments":"This is a very great place to stay while visiting Maui. Wake up and make yourselves a cup of coffee from the espresso machine to get the day started. Comes with all the house essentials you can think of. If booking lots of boat activities like snorkeling tours, sunset dinners and guided fishing trips departing from Maalaea harbor. Look no further than this condo because it is a very short walk to the harbor which will cut back travel time and save you money on parking!! I highly recommend dropping by beach bums also located at the harbor for drinks and some delicious BBQ!!! Nice central location on the island makes for easy travel and good time.

I give four stars only because it does not have a full kitchen--if that doesn't bother you then consider the best choice in Princeville for the money. A kitchen in Hawaii would be nice simply because it costs a lot to dine out every meal and the food is not spectacular unless you visit one of the the islands finer dining establishments ($$$). The place does have a refrigerator, microwave and toaster so you can easily whip up a breakfast/lunch from stuff you get at the nearby super market. Good location, it's close to the infamous and BEAUTIFUL Hanalei Bay and town, many different beaches, the St. Regis hotel, right next to the golf course, and there is a good shopping center pretty close by that has it all--grocery store, mexican food, thai food, ice cream, shave ice, shopping etc. This was our first stay at this place and first time using Airbnb and it was super easy--easier than a hotel and much cheaper. Karl and Rachel respond very quickly to your questions/emails/texts. When we go again we will be staying here. Also note, plan on renting a car--well worth the money and a must have to explore the island and Princeville is about a 30-45 min drive from the airport (there are plenty of places to rent a car at Lihue airport).

There were things in the apartment to use, too, such as boogie boards and beach mats. The mini-kitchenette was helpful, as I could make my own breakfast and lunches to go there--and coffee, as well. There were dishes and utensils, too--and towels of all sizes, so you don't need to bring your own. I will definitely come back as soon as I can--and stay here again.

We wanted an inexpensive option, we wanted this location, so this worked great. There may be nicer or more recently remodeled places for a bit more money, but the full sized fridge with freezer was a major selling point for this one, as was a full sized (not 4-cup) coffee maker - giving this an advantage over many we looked at. It also had some beach stuff to borrow which was very nice. The pool in the complex is fairly nice, and the BBQs seemed to work OK once you got them to light.

The location of the condo is terrific, in the center of Princeville, in a well kept complex. The unit was small as advertised but did not feel at all cramped for two people, it had a good size bathroom and nice size lanai for al fresco dining.  The unit was thoughtfully outfitted with everything needed to prepare your own food (except a cooktop, but they have grills in the complex).\r\n\r\nThe parking situation can be a little tricky if you get back very late (or perhaps we were there at a busy time), though thankfully we never had to test the auxiliary parking option, located 300 yards from the complex.\r\n\r\nI believe some others have commented on the place not being perfectly clean - we felt it was quite clean.

In regards to location, the studio is a short drive to Hanalei which is a quaint laid back town with lots of food options. There was also a Foodland close by that had very fresh ahi poke.

There is no AC which normally is fine but with no winds it was really really hot and humid in the studio. We slept with the ceiling fan on and a box fan positioned at the sliding door to the porch. So if you are visiting in winter, the temperature will probably be fine. For us it was really hot and unfortunately quite loud. The price was great and Karl was very nice over the phone and email. On the porch were small beach chairs and a cooler which we used. There were 2 pool/beach towels, so you don't have to pack them.

We didn't feel anything was missing for the whole 10 days were there. It was really nice to have a little private balcony to have breakfast on, and the barbecues in the pool area were great too. We were a bit concerned about \"invading\" the pool area, not being residents, but the few people we met there made us feel welcome. Although we didn't meet the hosts, Karl was very quick to respond to any questions we had.\r\n\r\nIt's in a good location - little Princeville centre is walkable (we really recommend Tiki Iniki!) and the larger Hanalei is really nice and just a short drive away (we loved it there). Most of the rest of the island is easy to explore from here too, except Waimea canyon which takes around 2.5 hours to get to (but was so spectacular that we went there twice!)\r\n\r\nThe only thing I would make people aware of is this condo is not a place for parties - there's a strict 9pm noise curfew which the neighbours do enforce, especially because the way the condo is laid out you can sometimes hear people talking very clearly.

I think that's the best way to describe it. We knew we'd be out most of the time and wanted to spend the money on food and activities so this was great. It's pretty small - like 300 sf. It has a small dining table with 2 chairs in side and a table with 4 chairs on the patio - which is pretty big. The bathroom has a dispenser with shampoo/condition/body wash (which I thought was great). There is also a blow dryer (also nice). The only real problem was parking - there aren't really enough spots. 5 of the 8 nights, we parked on grass or some other non-spot. I don't think anyone will tow you as long as you're in the lot and not in someone's way. Also there's no air conditioning - maybe that's listed but I didn't realize and that was the one thing I complained about to my husband. At night, there's a nice breeze. There are plates and cutlery as well as wine glasses. The owners are SUPER nice. I said the internet wasn't working and my husband had to do work and Karl came over early the next morning to fix it.

You should stay at this airbnb if you want to save money. It's really the bare minimum - small and dark. There is no AC and the unit is pretty outdated. Unfortunately, we encountered a couple cockroaches during our stay. Its understandable due to tropical weather, but it was still rather unpleasant. \r\n\r\nWe tried to minimize our time spent at the unit.

The pool \u0026 bbq area was nice as well, however prior to our trip there was a review where customer states there were bugs or roaches in the studio. I asked Karl about this,he stated \"that there are always bugs anywhere you go\". Unfortunately there were roaches, both nights we were there. Which was a big disappointment. Another disappointment was the  room fan that was in there studio, it was old and dirty and only had one speed the lowest.  There is a ceiling fan but did not cool the room as we would have liked. We slept  with front \u0026  back doors open the first night the next day we bought a box fan which helped tremendously with the ceiling fan to circulate the air.\nWe did not contact owner (our decision) since policy is strict and we wanted to enjoy our time in Kauai. \n\nWe chose to leave for another place to stay where there we had the best time.

There was a large bed, plenty of pillows, and towels. I loved the self check in and check out process, it saved a lot of time and stress. Karl’s directions for the entire process were clear and concise. He also provided us with a map of the apartment complex and Kaua’i itself. There were also a lot of homey touches, like a microwave, toaster oven, full sized fridge, a coffee maker, and dishes, which really made the trip much smoother. There was also a small balcony with a table/chairs. The grills down at the pool at the complex were also a huge perk! I would highly suggest this place for any couple. It was a great price, location, and amenities!

It's a couple minute walk to the Metro bus which for 5 Euros takes you to the airport (a 40 minute ride). The neighborhood, Poble Sec, is safe, has some bars and restaurants to hang out at and is great for a tourist. The Poble Sec metro is at the end of the street, the Parallel metro is a five minute walk, the D20 bus that takes you to beach is right there.

So if you spend much time there, it is maybe not the best choice. But who wouldn't want to spend most of the time outside in a city like Barcelona... :)\n\nThank you for everything Juan Pablo!"},{"_id":"182718421","date":{"$date":"2017-08-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15284591","reviewer_id":"30872797","reviewer_name":"Pablo","comments":"Juan Pablo was great.

Blai Street, where the apartment is located, is awesome and has lots of great pintxos. It was the most local-feeling rambla I came across. You can walk up the hill nearby for a great view of the city and the barrio Gothic is very close. The walk from the bus from the airport to the apartment was about 10-15 minutes. The lock on my bedroom door was broken when I arrived, which Juan Pablo fixed that night. It broke again the following day. Wasn't a big deal and I wasn't even expecting a lock on my room, buy fyi."},{"_id":"188404355","date":{"$date":"2017-08-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15284591","reviewer_id":"29841068","reviewer_name":"Luisa","comments":"Juan is very kind, and made me feel quite comfortable.

It's beautiful, relaxing, spacious, and great amenities. \n\nLocation:\nThe place was in a residential area, quiet and serene with a gorgeous backyard view of the mountains. Has a great country feel to it, with roosters crowing in the early dawn. The place is gated, which is a huge plus. Parking spots are provided. The location is in North Shore super close to Haleiwa and all the beautiful beaches. I would suggest renting a vehicle to get to all your destinations. \n\nHost:\nThe owner/host lives on site which, to me, was super convenient because he was able to answer questions immediately or provide us with things that were missing. He was very accommodating. The dogs are also super friendly. My baby wasn't even afraid of them. \n\nPlace:\nOur place was clean and inviting. The only downfall I would say was that there was no AC, but the ceiling fans made up for it. It's all hardwood flooring. Each room had closets. The host even provided us with a foam cooler, beach towels, and a beach umbrella for use. We made our own breakfast daily and ate it on the balcony while staring into the beautiful view. The furniture was comfy. The decoration was modern and matched very well with the furniture. The showers do work but difficult to figure out and once you get it, it's fairly simple. There are fruit trees on site that the host allowed us to pick at freely. The mangoes were delicious! \n\nAll in all, we enjoyed our stay very much and would recommend to everyone."},{"_id":"230976535","date":{"$date":"2018-01-29T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15285714","reviewer_id":"27527539","reviewer_name":"Paula","comments":"We loved this place.

I don't understand why people book hotels when places like this exist. The value for what you get is amazing. Nice owners, introduced himself and respected our privacy so that was great. This place feels safe, don't have to worry about leaving stuff in the place with the doors unlocked. I loved the dog adira, it kept coming over and saying hi the whole time. The other dog was really shy. Really has an amazing view out of the porch. I would look this place up first among any other options when ever back in Oahu. Also I loved the chickens/ roosters they are very good at making sure you get up on time in the morning. This helped to maximize our time and do more activities as they never miss their 5am wake up calls, even when there was a tropical storm hitting they still did the job.\n\nThings that could be done better: A.C. I know the listing says no AC so you can't be mad at that. It got super hot and humid while there and the fans can only do so much. Maybe they should invest in a portable swamp cooler that rolls around for the summer time. I'd even pay more if that's what it would take. \n\nBugs, bugs, and more bugs. I understand it's Hawaii , everything is green and it's country. So I can live with the bugs. It is a little nerve wrecking when you hop in the shower and there's just a lizard staring you down on the wall, or a cockroach that hides inside your jacket. Other than that it's to be expected as it's country, and I'd still come back 100 times over.\n\nThe host really should include instructions somewhere on how to turn on the shower. that might be the norm in Hawaii but I've never seen anything like it, and after reading the reviews looks like others have had the same issue. However the host is a short phone call away and you'll have it figured out. \n\nThat being said this is a perfect listing, and is soooooo much better than staying in Waikiki. So do yourself a favor and stay here."},{"_id":"327965368","date":{"$date":"2018-09-24T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15285714","reviewer_id":"49024804","reviewer_name":"Torsten","comments":"Spacious Appartement with huge kitchen , nearly equipped with everything.

He loves to enjoy the great outdoors, especially when that means fishing, paddle boarding and taking walks with our dogs.","host_response_time":"within a day","host_thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/89f95ad1-2791-4af4-8e9e-18e4ace41850.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","host_picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/89f95ad1-2791-4af4-8e9e-18e4ace41850.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","host_neighbourhood":"Hilo","host_response_rate":80,"host_is_superhost":false,"host_has_profile_pic":true,"host_identity_verified":false,"host_listings_count":1,"host_total_listings_count":1,"host_verifications":["email","phone","reviews","kba"]},"address":{"street":"Pepeekeo, HI, United States","suburb":"Hilo","government_area":"South Hilo","market":"The Big Island","country":"United States","country_code":"US","location":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-155.09392,19.86134],"is_location_exact":true}},"availability":{"availability_30":15,"availability_60":39,"availability_90":62,"availability_365":233},"review_scores":{"review_scores_accuracy":10,"review_scores_cleanliness":10,"review_scores_checkin":10,"review_scores_communication":10,"review_scores_location":10,"review_scores_value":10,"review_scores_rating":100},"reviews":[{"_id":"135887777","date":{"$date":"2017-03-06T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15285878","reviewer_id":"5868821","reviewer_name":"Jordan","comments":"Don't follow (Hidden by Airbnb) maps, it's a little tricky to find but easy enough with some local directions  "},{"_id":"139131252","date":{"$date":"2017-03-23T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15285878","reviewer_id":"30597560","reviewer_name":"Claire","comments":"The house is gorgeous and stays in a serene community.

First impression when you open the door is a WOW- a very pretty and spacious great room with high ceilings, lots of comfy couches and a big kitchen, all of which overlooks the pool and courtyard and lawn (all secluded) through a wall of windows and glass doors. Very relaxing! \n\nThough you couldn't see the sea from the house, it was a very quick walk through the property to stand on cliffs overlooking the ocean. We had mongoose coming through on occasion, several colorful lizards, a fascinating snail, and no mosquitoes.  \n\nThe bedrooms were all spacious with plenty of bathroom space and the kitchen was well-equipped. We stayed in the main house, with three bedrooms and the guest apartment above the garage, which is in a separate building, and which has its own kitchenette and bathroom. We ate all of our dinners in and loved a rainy morning spent playing in the pool and just hanging out. \n\nThe house was probably about a 15-min drive from Hilo and we went on outings to Richardson Beach for the sea turtles, Hawaiian Brain Freeze for crazy portions of shaved ice, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, Akako Falls and the Kapoho tide pools. Nothing was more than about an hour away. \n\nMahi was helpful, responded to all of our questions promptly, and left all sorts of goodies and drinks for us, which we all appreciated! We have only good things to say and would definitely return to this house on future trips Hilo-side."},{"_id":"146812811","date":{"$date":"2017-04-23T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15285878","reviewer_id":"67260711","reviewer_name":"Marcia","comments":"Peaceful Pepeekeo Hale is where you want to enjoy your next stay while on the Hilo side.

Communicating with the owner was so easy and she was always quick to respond if we had questions. For the most part the house is fully stocked with everything you could need (beach towels, dishes, cookwear etc...) but we did find that the spices were limited and some of the cooking utensils were flimsy. If you plan to cook meals, just keep this in mind. The house is secluded in a private neighborhood, but is only a 20 minutes drive to Hilo. There is a scenic route to Hilo that starts right near the house and this made the drive into town even more enjoyable.

There was also some paper, crayons, sand buckets and pool toys that were perfect for our two 5 yo’s.   The kitchen was very well equipped and there were some basic staples and spices.  The living room had a large TV with satellite channels. It was a bonus having a washer and dryer and there was even laundry detergent that we could use.  Rooms were all clean and spacious.  Each bedroom had a king size bed and had plenty of extra linens and blankets.  It was great that there were beach towels that we could use as they are so bulky to pack.

The area is absolutely fantastic and it's within two or three blocks from all you will need: the beach (one block away!), tube station, bus stops, supermarkets, restaurants and trendy bars in the corner. The flat is lovely and is exactly as shown in the pictures (actually pretty big for a studio, and carefully decorated in an arty way). It's in the nicest area of Copacabana (30 min walk to Ipanema). While the windows face an internal patio, the flat has natural light and this is what makes it very quiet, despite being surrounded by bars and restaurants. It can get a bit hot inside, but Giovanna has just bought a new aircon which allows you to stay cool inside in spite of the 40 degrees outside. It's good to go out, though. She is the perfect host - anything you may need, she will reply within seconds via (Hidden by Airbnb) and will try to sort it out (i.e. a new iron, a toaster, a new aircon, a plug, etc). Truly recommend this studio.

There is ample sleeping space as the living room couch opens to a sleeper, and the futon in the front bedroom also opens up. We did not use the air mattress but one was available. This is in addition to the two beds. \n\nThe building security is nice as residents have to come through two locked doors to enter. Then there is the apartment door as well. \n\nThe location is wonderful. Basically a mile to Times Square, and a half mile to a mile to Broadway theaters. We saw three shows while we were there and walked to them all. There is every kind of restaurant you can think of in this area. We had great pizza and pasta at Uncle Mario's around the corner. We had great Tex Mex at El Azteca. We had great breakfast at Galaxy Diner. I was with 3 kids so we didn't try anything too fancy. \n\nCheck in with Angela's assistant Allen was easy and he showed us around the apartment. He's very friendly and available to handle any issues. \n\nThis apartment felt very safe. The front bedroom is bit noisy as it faces the street and is also near the front door of the building so you can hear everyone coming and going plus street traffic noise. It was quiet though between midnight and 6 am. The back bedroom is very quiet as is the living room. \n\nOverall this is a great place to stay. I did have some trouble reaching Angela for check in instructions in the 24 hours before my trip which made me nervous, but it all ended up working out. \n\n"},{"_id":"125960544","date":{"$date":"2017-01-08T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15309509","reviewer_id":"109663245","reviewer_name":"Tanya","comments":"Great experience"},{"_id":"127711767","date":{"$date":"2017-01-20T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15309509","reviewer_id":"102645014","reviewer_name":"Blair","comments":"Great location in Hells Kitchen, inexpensive to get anywhere with Uber or Lyft.

Our group of six stayed here for three nights (August 17-20, 2017), and worked only with Allan, Angela’s assistant. Upon our arrival, he told us if we got there early to NOT wait outside with our suitcases. Then once inside he asked during our stay that we NOT talk to the neighbors, and that if we happen to run into them – to lie and tell them we are “Angela’s friends” who were visiting. Immediately, we got the impression that the building’s management wasn’t aware they are operating Airbnb through their apartment, and felt uncomfortable. It was upon our arrival that we were also disappointed to find the space not ready or very cleanly. There were leftover bottles of alcohol in the refrigerator, dirty dishes in the dishwasher, no sheets on one of the bedroom beds (luckily there were extras in the closet), and the bathroom was the worst. The bathroom sink’s faucet was broke (so every time we turned it on it lifted off); the shower curtain was a cheap plastic one that was hard and full of soap scum and mold / mildew; and along the bathtub / bathroom floor there was also mildew. Our group had a busy itinerary while visiting NYC, and was only at the apartment to shower and sleep. We had a great trip; my only regret is that I didn’t document some of the things I noted above regarding this apartment because upon our checkout, we got a very unprofessional message from Angela (who we had never even worked with) claiming that we didn’t leave her property in the same condition as when we arrived. In her message, she not only requested / tried to charge us $250 (!!!), she also scolded us for using too many towels (again, there were six of us there for four days – what does she expect?) and wrongfully accused us of puking (?!?!) on her cheap plastic shower curtain (which was an appalling accusation, as we are adults – if someone had got sick, we would have certainly cleaned it up). Basically, we overlooked their dirtiness and then they tried to blame us for it. Our group checked out on time at noon that Sunday, 8/20, and everyone showered that morning and used their towels. Out of pure courtesy to them, we placed our wet towels in the bathtub for the cleaning people to easily access, and apparently that was a huge no-no too. From the message we received, it sounded they wanted us to wash, dry and put away the towels the towels we used before we left. If that was the case, they should have told us. Our group thoroughly cleaned the apartment’s kitchen area (ran the dishwasher and put dishes away; took out the garbage, as requested; emptied the refrigerator), made beds (and even removed the sheets from the ones that..."},{"_id":"188090599","date":{"$date":"2017-08-28T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15309509","reviewer_id":"123136379","reviewer_name":"Mary Ann","comments":"This is a great place to stay in New York City.

What I liked most about her home was the location, close to everything and walking distance to time square. When I made the reservation with Angela she was nice and answered all my questions... even though it took her a few days to respond. A few days before my trip, I did not hear from her and had to reach out to her to ask if she needed anything from me since the trip was approaching, she said her assistant Allan would check me in. Upon arriving in NY, Allan, who was really nice reached out to me via text and gave me check in time and instructions. A few hours before check in, he texted me again and said he would not be able to make it on time and sent me to another assistant who would check me in. There was a lot of back and forth with Allan and the new assistant about check-in and I did not speak to Angela at all before or during my trip , until after I returned home.\nShe sent me a message claiming we damaged her property and requested $500!!! She claimed we threw a party when there was only 6 of us, saying we broke a \"noise device\" when all we did was unplug it to plug in a phone charger, saying we broke her chair and \"kicked in\" her door when neither of those happened since we were barely there, spilling beer and \"ruining\" her couch when we only had two six packs of beer over the entire 4 days which definitely wasn't spilled, harassing me by sending me pictures and screenshots of the convos with her very unprofessional cleaner who claimed to take an EXTRA 5 hours to clean a two bedroom one bath apartment that just needed trash thrown away and sheets/towels washed. And lastly both her and her cleaner accused me of doing drugs in her apartment when it was very clearly my translucent makeup left over on the counter since there was only one mirror other than the one in the bathroom. My advice to anyone looking to reserve Angela's home: DON'T!!! And if you do make sure you take pictures of every ding and dent in her apartment because she will accuse you of \"damages\". After she accused me of damaging her property , I read a review from a previous guest who she tried to scam as well.  She is clearly running a SCAM and airbnb needs to shut down her operation."},{"_id":"198461537","date":{"$date":"2017-09-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15309509","reviewer_id":"29196025","reviewer_name":"Fei","comments":"Good location."},{"_id":"200169587","date":{"$date":"2017-10-04T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15309509","reviewer_id":"21543393","reviewer_name":"Edwina","comments":"We had a great stay in this apartment. 2 adults and 3 children and there was plenty of room.

The apartment is right in the heart of Hell's Kitchen, close to many theaters and restaurants.\nThe place is as described and can accommodate five to six guest easily. The beds are great.\nAngela's assistant was very helpful and available to come over when we needed an extra set of sheets and a couple extra towels.\n\nThe only issue was that I'd asked if we could leave the luggage before check-in. At first I was told it was a possibility, in case there were no other guests. On the day we had to check-in, the apartment was being vacated and cleaned. When we made it to Manhattan from the airport, I informed Angela's assistant that we had arrived a bit early (about two hours before check-in) and we would be waiting outside if she couldn't let us leave the bags early. \nApparently, this was a big issue, because just by waiting on a public sidewalk, we would be disturbing the tenants of the building. Just mentioning that we would be waiting outside prompted several messages from Angela that were pretty rude. \n\"My assistant told you four times already check-in is at 3 pm\" (we only wanted to leave our bags) \"Find a coffee shop or something\" and so on.

The washer and dryer had mold stains and the rug in the living room felt like it hadn't been vacuumed in a while.\nOther than this, it was a pleasant stay. \nIf you're looking for a convenient place with no frills, this is the place for you."},{"_id":"215083878","date":{"$date":"2017-11-27T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15309509","reviewer_id":"131853067","reviewer_name":"Greg","comments":"Great place to stay"},{"_id":"216558036","date":{"$date":"2017-12-04T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15309509","reviewer_id":"13479875","reviewer_name":"Ali","comments":"Great apartment in a quiet street which is easily accessible to Times Square and Central Park.

It's super clean, very comfortable and with the exception of being a little on the chilly side due to a broken heater in one of the bedrooms, it's a brilliant place to stay, at a super reasonable price. (Mind you the heater problem is probably only temporary and won't matter much once the month of May comes around, and they did supply a nice little space heater that helped take the chill out of the air) In all seriousness location is key with this place. I mean I walked everywhere, but what I really loved was having a washer and dryer! Man oh Man it's good to travel light and wash your clothes. Lastly, I can't forget the hospital of Angela's assist Allen who was our contact point for the stay and he couldn't have been better. Prompt, friendly, and just a cool guy. He even went so far as to ship me back a left behind headset the same day I left it. Thank you Allen. This is a great example of what an airbnb property should be.\n"},{"_id":"229791568","date":{"$date":"2018-01-25T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15309509","reviewer_id":"72977995","reviewer_name":"Hoang","comments":"Great location, just a few steps to Time Square.

Also, we are 15 minutes walking distance to Coogee Beach (our favourite!).\r\n\r\nAs a traveller: \r\nI prefer quiet and relaxing homes and when travelling I barely stay on my Airbnb room as I am constantly exploring. I like to chat with my hosts to find out the best places to eat and see from a local's point of view as well as building friendship with my hosts.\r\nI either travel alone or with my Italian husband Claudio.

I was in Sydney for work and needed to stay near UNSW. The location was perfect for me, walking distance to work, as well as walking distance to beautiful Coogee beach. There are a couple of nice restaurants nearby for food, as well as some nice cafe, though I only tried 22 Grams by Cindy's recommendation (and liked it so much that went there for breakfast twice more!). My room (which looks like they are turning into a home office) was small and cosy, and had all I needed. Several towels, a rack for clothes, as well as hot water bottle and a small heater that were very useful as Sydney was rather cold during my stay. The only non-pleasant point w.r.t. my stay was the very loud banging noise that was due to the construction in the building (upstairs I think). It would start rather early (sometime between 7 and 8). So if you are not a very early riser, and are booking in very near future, I recommend checking with Cindy and Claudio as to the level of noise. Otherwise, I had a great stay and highly recommend this place, specially if you want to be near Coogee as well as UNSW."},{"_id":"191824653","date":{"$date":"2017-09-09T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15312988","reviewer_id":"41918065","reviewer_name":"Henry","comments":"房间非常的干净,设备齐全,就是初到澳洲,英语不行,也没跟房东多交流交流,总体不错,好评!"},{"_id":"195555703","date":{"$date":"2017-09-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15312988","reviewer_id":"8216197","reviewer_name":"Asyurah","comments":"Everything about my stay with Cindy and Claudio had been lovely.

It's very busy in the Waikiki area, therefore lots of traffic, busses, scooters... can be loud... recommend sleeping with earplugs if you have trouble sleeping.  It has a nice big TV with cable, wifi, full size refrigerator, small 4 burner stove and small oven, micorwave, very nice dining table with 3 chairs.  One bed sleeps 2 people and the other is for 1 person.  The linens were very nice and clean, good pillows.  The view is of the neighboring apt. buildings.  It has 1 off-street covered parking place, which is an excellent asset.  If you want to be in the Waikiki area and don't want to spend a fortune at the hotels, I recommend this studio apt.

When we checked in we looked around to see what we needed to buy because there are thing's already there that you might not have to spend on. There's bath towels,  beach towels, some toiletries. Check behind the medicine cabinet, there's some sunblock and stuff. There's a first aid kit in the closet by the front door. There's beach mats, floaties, hair dryer, and more. The kitchen has dishes, cups, silverware, pots, and even a crockpot. Parking is right under the building. We felt safe and didn't  have to worry about anything. You will see people walking up and down this street and it is a one way street that drives towards the Ala Wai canal. Waikiki beach is a few blocks away. Food pantry (grocery store) and a coffee shop inside Food pantry is a block away. The bathroom is small but suffice. For the price it was great and with a friendly guy like John and his lady friend, I'm glad I got the chance to meet them.  They are both amazing!!!

It's walking distance to everything in Waikiki, really in the middle of it all so you can easily turn left to the Zoo end or right to the Hilton end. John was able to provide extra perks like snorkel sets and beach gear free of charge. You really can't get that at hotels.

You are literally down the street from an ABC store (convenience store) and just blocks away from the beach, International Market, local restaurants, shops, zoo and Alamo car rental. I do want to warn anyone that has issues with stairs though, this place has no elevators. I stayed on the third floor and had to lug everything up those stairs and lug everything down. I don’t have an issue with stairs nor the girls I traveled with since it’s just extra cardio I’m happy to add into my day, so that wasn’t an issue, but I do see it as a potential problem for old folks and people with babies with lots and lots of luggage and stuff. I mean you might as well climb those stairs because you’re saving money, just saying. Keep in mind that you’re not paying for a 5 star Ritz-Carlton so don’t be a brat. The place is older, therefore some of the things are older and the owners are trying their best to keep it in its best shape as much as possible. Such as the AC. It works just fine and we were always so happy to come back to a cool room but it does leak (our unit’s AC leaked outside anyway so it never bothered us) and the owners are aware of it, did warn us about it before hand and have plans to fix it for future guests. The honesty was appreciated. If you use a crap ton of towels like I do, then bring your own few extras because they only supply enough for the amount of guests staying. You can use the laundry downstairs for $1.50-1.75 to rewash the towels or anything else you want to wash. Which is nice because I would hate to lug everything to a local laundromat on vacation! The microwave works just fine and I’m glad they have it along with the full fridge too. We didn’t cook so didn’t use the stove and cannot comment on that but it looked really clean. They also supply dish soap, a broom and a vacuum we didn’t use. My favorite would probably be the beach toys they supplied!! OMG it was our favorite!!! There’s a cute beach umbrella, beach bags and towels, a noodle, donut, and mini surf floaty-thing and even a large Asian mat to use at the beach that’s big enough for a whole family to use as a picnic. I was so happy to see all of it because it meant we didn’t have to buy anything. Talk about being grateful for those and SAVIN. THEM. DOLLAS for other shenanigans. They have a really nice flat screen TV but we were never in the room long enough to use it. We’re in Hawaii! Why would we stay inside to watch a movie?! There’s also fast, dependable and free WiFi. Great for students that need to do some..."},{"_id":"336881336","date":{"$date":"2018-10-14T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15314458","reviewer_id":"214313707","reviewer_name":"Mimi","comments":"Hospitality is the best!

Redfern is an inner-city suburb of Sydney. Once decidedly bohemian, Redfern is in the later stages of gentrification. Situated alongside the ever-popular and fashionable Surry Hills, and just moments from the CBD, Redfern is a perfectly positioned city base.  Conveniently located close to Sydney’s CBD (Redfern station is just one stop way from Central station by train) together with a well-serviced bus network, Redfern is primed for getting around. Also in close proximity to the airport. Redfern residents are thoroughly enjoying its revival. There is a mix of young professionals, young families and mature locals enjoying the convenient lifestyle. There is a hip and creative vibe in the area. With a mix of warehouse conversions, Victorian terrace houses and new apartment buildings, it’s a vibrant and eclectic mix of architecture. People can be found enjo","notes":"","transit":"Closest train station - Redfern Station. Next stop is Central Station, which is central to all trains and a central part of the city. There are buses that go into the city also and can be found close by. These run regularly. My favourite places to go for brunch are – Bean and Berry, Baffi and Mo’s, Three Williams, Henry Lee’s, Brickfields. Great food, coffee and service. My favourite bars are – The Dock, Arcadia Liquors, The Bearded Tit, Cake Wines Lovely places to go for dinner – Pitt Street Diner, The Continental. You’ll love my place because of the coziness, location, the people, and the ambiance. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travellers, families (with kids), and big groups.","access":"Their room, lounge room, kitchen, bathrooms, courtyard.","interaction":"Certainly be able to help with anything you need.

Martha and her family were gracious hosts that made a wonderful breakfast each morning and joined us to chat about current events and the day ahead.

Non mi sono sentita più  libera di muovermi in casa.\nUltima spiacevole sorpresa è stata essere svegliata il giorno del check-out per dover lasciare la stanza in anticipo rispetto a quanto Airbnb mi aveva comunicato.\nCredevo Airbnb fosse un buon sistema per viaggiare, conoscere nuove persone, creare scambi culturali e magari rapporti con chi vive e conosce altre città, non è stato così e purtroppo non so se mi fiderò ancora di quel che è scritto negli annunci.\nCredo che  per soggiorni lunghi come il mio non sia una buona opzione, ma per vacanze di pochi giorni, stando poco in casa, questo alloggio possa andar bene, è in una buona posizione, vicino alla metro Q, efficientissima, 20 minuti a piedi da Central Park e vicina ad un altro piccolo parco lungo l'East river, adatto per correre e rilassarsi, a starbucks, sempre utile e buoni supermercati.\nBuona fortuna e viaggio a chi va a scoprire New York, città da molte sfaccettature, ma sicuro da vivere nella sua palpabile libertà.\n"},{"_id":"147995487","date":{"$date":"2017-04-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15360364","reviewer_id":"22856798","reviewer_name":"Ron","comments":"A fine, comfortable bed in a clean, convenient apartment that's a good place to just stay the night, but don't expect to want to hang around.

This place is not for everyone and you need to see if it is a suitable for you. I personally this this place is good if you:\n-Only stay for a short term and just need a cheap place to crash at\n-Do not care much for messiness\n-Do not care much for privacy\n-Can sleep easily under any circumstances\n\nBelow is the pros and cons of this place.\nPros:\n- Located in UES with many bars and restaurants around\n- Q line is only 5-10 min away on foot\n- Mattress is comfortable\n- Walk-in closet in the bedroom\n- Water pressure isn’t too bad\n- Rent is inexpensive (is it worth what it has to offer? It’s up to your expectations)\n\nCons:\n- There is no heating system for this unit; the building controls it. It’s only automatically turned on during the winter. On the chilly nights in spring/fall, they use their gas oven in the kitchen to heat the house. (Isn’t this a safety hazard? (Hidden by Airbnb) says it run the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning but they would probably say it’s been working for them well.)\n- There is no air conditioning system in the bedroom. Apparently it’s only in the living room and they were reluctant to turn it on when it was 84 degrees outside (that was 29th April (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) , you can check the weather history).\n- It is misleading that they have laundry as the amenities. The building does not have washer/dryer. You’ll need to use a laundromat open for the public outside the building. It is $3 to use a small washer and $6 for a bigger one. To use dryer, it’s a 25 cents for 7 min.\n- It is a 1-bedroom apartment. The landlord and her mom sleep on the couch outside. She told me her mom is going to stay there only for a week. I cut my stay short before verifying this is true, but based on the review below written in italian, it seems that the mom stayed there for the whole time. Given that the landlord doesn't know how the laundromat outside works because only her mom has been doing the laundry for her, her remarks are credible.\n- Bath tub and bathroom sinks were clogged. But this is easily fixable.\n- Bathroom is quite messy but I found it tolerable. It’s really up to the individual. The italian lady down there seemed to have been not OK with that.\n\nI find the description of their listing quite misleading but I do NOT have the evidence that they intentionally try to trick people on purpose. You just need to know what the place has to offer and see if the price you’re paying is worth it. Ask the right questions and have the right expectations and you will be fine."},{"_id":"193725355","date":{"$date":"2017-09-14T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15360364","reviewer_id":"12673917","reviewer_name":"Jay","comments":"Kristina was a great hostess.

However, it turned out to be a blessing in disguise. Although I checked in during the afternoon to pick up the keys and meet Kristina, a gracious, friendly host, I did not check out the bed.  As for the PROS, this place is convenient, near transpo, safe, and relatively reasonable.  As for the CONS, I discovered a very old, worn, stained bottom sheet covered with pilling that felt like sandpaper, along with an old lumpy pillow that was covered on both sides by a very stained pillowcase.  The lack of a top sheet increased my concern and discomfort for potential health hazards from countless guests who used the comforter in place of a top sheet. The air conditioner cools the living room, not the guest room (especially when closed for privacy), which only has small fan. The bathroom sink continues to drain very slowly as reported in May 2017 (I did not try the shower for the same reason). If the host secures new, comfortable sheets along with a new pillow for the guest bed and gets the drains cleared, I would definitely give this place more stars! It’s a great location if you want to get some exercise. Be prepared to climb 50+ steps from the street level to the 4th floor!"},{"_id":"262376042","date":{"$date":"2018-05-08T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15360364","reviewer_id":"30552519","reviewer_name":"Alexis","comments":"Kristina was very kind and communicated quickly.

Lots of convenient stores/restaurants and a Starbucks next door. Host provided oscillating fan in room which was a nice touch. PACK LIGHT(ish) 3 sets of narrow stairs but definitely manageable. I have suggested to the host to provide a full length mirror in the bedroom, but otherwise advise you to bring your own handheld mirror if you prefer to get ready in your bedroom versus the bathroom.

Apesar da localização ser excelente o apartamento não acomoda 3 pessoas apenas casal . Fomos eu , meu marido e minha filha de 15 anos e o apartamento apresenta apenas 1 cama de casal e a terceira acomodação era um colchão de inflar que estava furado. Imediatamente comunicamos o Daniel sobre o ocorrido e ele demorou 12 horas para nós responder e exigiu foto do colchão furado para verificar a veracidade da informação. Como era véspera de feriado de Natal nos informou que não poderia comprar um novo nem emprestar um outro colchão e que tínhamos má sorte . Ficamos lá por mais três dias nos revezando eu e minha filha num sofá de 2 lugares para não dormirmos no chão em pleno inverno canadense. Além disso não havia lavadora nem secadora de roupas como no anúncio. Recomendo o lugar apenas para casais não serve para família e Daniel não é um anfitrião confiável.

He was always very quick to reply with help on any questions we had regarding the area, such as finding suitable parking as it can be difficult at times. Daniel was kind to also check up on us mid way of our stay.\nThe loft itself is a great space for a single traveler or a couple. The area was close to many amazing local attractions and eats of downtown Montreal. We loved that many of these places were within walking distance for the added convenience.
