They checked on us regularly to make sure we didn't need anything.  They are so easy-going and flexible they let us check out late because our flight didn't leave until 11p.m.  \n\nMaalaea is very central, close to the airport, close to lahaina, close to Kihei, close to Haleakala.  very convenient and you don't have to deal with the traffic in Lahaina and Kihei.  Maalaea was also quite windy during our stay (not sure if it is that way year-round), so if you're reading this, bring some ear plugs and you will sleep like a baby! \n\nThe condo is beautiful with an astonishing waterfront view from the spacious balcony.  Modern finishings, beautiful bathroom, large king size bed and Mark even included beach towels and beach chairs for his guests to use!  The pin pad door lock was super convenient (means we didn't have to carry a key around with us).  The unit included a parking stall for our rental car, and the complex has a lovely pool if you get tired of all the snorkeling and salt water swimming on the island.    \n\nCannot say enough good things about Mark, his family, and this Air Bnb!  Highly recommend!"},{"_id":"216798457","date":{"$date":"2017-12-05T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"20872439","reviewer_id":"31610438","reviewer_name":"Natalie","comments":"*CLEAN\n*GREAT LOCATION\n*GREAT AMENITIES\n*AMAZING VIEW\n\nWe have used airbnb many times, and this was by far our favorite stay and the most transparent in terms of what was listed online. Often times, you arrive at a place and it doesn’t look as good as the photos, but this was the opposite. Photos didn’t do justice at how spacious it actually was or how great the view is. \n\nMark was beyond accommodating. Met us when we first arrived. Gave us a quick tour and assured us he is there to help us if we needed anything\n\nI loved everything about this condo. The location was wonderful. You aren’t in the crowded, overly touristy Kaanapali area, but you’re still centrally located to everything. The pool was great. Very clean. Never more than a couple of people laying out, so it was relaxing. It’s right next to the harbor, so if you want to snorkel it’s a 2 minute drive. I’d recommend snorkeling with a company who snorkels at Turtle town if you want to see sea turtles.  \n\nThe bedding was so comfortable. I slept so well. There were a few k cups for coffee, wine in the fridge, and laundry pods to do our laundry. Being able to do our laundry right in the condo was so convenient! \n\nOverall I would recommend this to anybody.  Thank you Mark. Can’t wait to visit again!"},{"_id":"218040929","date":{"$date":"2017-12-10T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"20872439","reviewer_id":"5357406","reviewer_name":"Tim","comments":"The Maalaea harbor neighborhood is quiet, relaxing, and very close to any action you might desire. Right there is an awesome beach, snorkeling, a beautiful pool and bbq, convenience store, an aquarium and shopping. But access to Kehei, Kahlahui, the north shore and the Maui Arts and Cultural Center is excellent. This collection of residences east of the harbor is the best kept secret in Maui. The digs themselves are well thought out, stylish (not just designer touches but a thoroughly conceived and accomplished feeling), and comfortable. We loved the place, the view, the ease of access and the people. It was a stunning and fulfilling five days in paradise.

The space was clean and bright. We had coffee on the balcony every morning of our stay and was able to see whales off in the distance. The area we stayed in was very quiet, and the people very friendly. Our host Mark and family greeted us, and made us feel very welcome. Mark responded promptly to any questions we had. \n\nWe had breakfast a couple of times at Maalaea General Store, which is within walking distance. The food and staff were amazing. Staff provided local tips and “must see” places. There’s only a couple of restaurants in walking distance, so renting a car is a must.

Despite leaving my phone in Canada (I was on vacation), he ensured I had all the information I needed.  Check in was easy; he gave me the parking spot number, condo number and the access code.  We had all our bags and groceries in the space when he came to check on us.  He answered all our questions clearly and immediately.\nThe space is amazing!  Mark has all the essentials including beach towels and chairs.  Every morning we watched the whales as we had our coffee and made our daily plans.   Don’t forget your binoculars so you can see the barnacles on the whales as they frolic.  Every evening we stood on the small beach and watched the turtles.   \nLocation is perfect.  The Ocean Center is a quick walk away and can be visited multiple times to get your marine questions answered.  It was a scenic drive to Ahihi-kinau natural area reserve to amazing snorkeling.  It was a short jaunt to Iao Valley State Park.  You could get groceries in Kahului after arrival at Costco or Target.  Or you can swing by Safeway in Kihei.  The harbour is very close with tours, shops and restaurants.\nThank you Mark, this was my best trip to Maui!\n"},{"_id":"230979919","date":{"$date":"2018-01-29T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"20872439","reviewer_id":"60285905","reviewer_name":"Magda","comments":"Where to begin..The place is amazing.

I really enjoyed being on the harbor. Amazing view, clean and cute condo. Easy check in, good communication with the hosts.\n\nOne tip for other guests is that it was pretty “no frills” ammenities wise. They did supply the standard towels, paper towels, kneenex, guest soap, toilet paper etc. There were two beach chairs, a beach umbrella, some kid beach toys, and some beach towels... but unfortuntely the umbrella and one chair were broken. We did enjoy the use of the beach towels though. There was no soap for the dish washer or washing machine which would have taken it to the next level for us ammenity wise (we left ours so hopefully the next guest can use it!) We also found ourselves sleeping on the pull out couch near the AC because the bedroom did get quite warm.\n\nOverall a great location, very close to Kihei and most other cities, and was a nice home base to come back to. It’s a great value so I understand why the ammenities were what they were.

The unit is in a secure building and on the top floor for great views. If you like trains, you will love it more! The kitchen has everything to make your own meals, which we did. When we arrived Alexey and Olga had a lovely bottle of wine waiting for us. Very thoughtful and considerate host. The bed was very comfortable. We used the downstairs bathroom with the large tub and shower, so convenient. The stairs are easily manageable but not for wheelchair users. The bathroom upstairs has a shower and the washer and dryer. That is such a plus for travelers. I would say we were able to enjoy our week in Sydney so much more because we rented this apartment.

A great place to stay for solo or couple travellers looking to get out and explore, or a business person (as in my case) who need quick access to the CBD paired with a clean, safe place to come home to each night."},{"_id":"218296699","date":{"$date":"2017-12-11T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"20906161","reviewer_id":"30155258","reviewer_name":"Cameron","comments":"Alexey's flat is awesome.

It’s a central location and easily accessible to the train. This place is perfect for those who have never used a train before because all trains end up at this location. The train system starts in a loop first and then branches out into the rest of the city and his place is within this loop. The place is much larger than what the pictures depict. 2 floors with 2 full bathrooms and 2 balconies. There is a very nice restaurant below. Prior to staying in the apartment we thought the noise from the trains would be a problem at night but I️ dont actually remember hearing them.  So I️ basically slept like a baby and I’m a very very light sleeper. It could be that the trains stopped running at night but I’m not actually sure. All in all, this is a great place to stay. We highly recommend it."},{"_id":"221534113","date":{"$date":"2017-12-26T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"20906161","reviewer_id":"89670873","reviewer_name":"Sunho","comments":"Very clean, Stylish decoration, Easy access to Central Main staion, Excellent communication, Good matress for traveler, My family had really good time in this double floored apartment.

The personal touches around the space with the paintings and books really made it cozy and comfortable. Complimentary Nespresso pods were also definitely a plus; however, once we discovered the breakfast place downstairs, we took every chance to order coffee from there. Seriously, some of the best food just in the next building over. Multiple other eateries and shops in walking distance. The train station is less than 3 minutes walking and Chinatown is 15 minutes walking. Usual city sounds come in from the outside but nothing loud to complain about. Would definitely stay at Alexey and Olga's place again if I ever return to Sydney.

Three balconies were incredible, great city skyline views. Very quiet building.

If you want a cheap quick eat - dominos pizza is down stairs; that was great for a sobering up recovery with my parents who visited. \n\nFor my first AIRBNB experience this house was exceptional and Alexey was very hospitable, I had planned on visiting with my partner but they broke up with me before I arrived from Melbourne. Alexey was very sweet leaving a bottle of wine for me and checking in on me to make sure I was okay. \n\nAll in all an amazing experience."},{"_id":"283916521","date":{"$date":"2018-07-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"20906161","reviewer_id":"12130009","reviewer_name":"Alicia","comments":"Amazing location!"},{"_id":"287206945","date":{"$date":"2018-07-08T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"20906161","reviewer_id":"53897338","reviewer_name":"Alyssa","comments":"The apartment was as descibed, Alexey was a responsive host. \n\nThere was something happening at Central Station in the wee hours that meant sirens were going off all night, and the construction in Chalmers St was noisy, but that didn't start til 9 am.

Though the trains seem to go through the night ( I looked if I got up) I did not hear (Email hidden by Airbnb) fortable mattress (on floor as in photos) and lounge to relax on after a long day out and about. \nI wish I’d had time to read some of those great looking books!\nVery homey and comfy and great location to get to anywhere!"},{"_id":"328330880","date":{"$date":"2018-09-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"20906161","reviewer_id":"31544275","reviewer_name":"Alexander","comments":"Alexey’s space was lovely!

The main issue we had during our stay was that the only elevator in the building was not working.

Perfect for those who want to convenience and close to some of the popular and trendy bars. \n\nQuick responses:  Alexey's response were quick which we appreciated. We had a change in date in our Airbnb and he was flexible in changing dates.\n\nCons:\n\nUnclear directions:  We would have preferred more clear direction and a step by step using AirBnB check in process. We spent (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) minutes looking for the building because the (Hidden by Airbnb) Map didn't pin point us the cab to the right location and the direction detailed was confusing. We used both Uber and 13cab and they both dropped us to the back of the building.  \n\nBroken elevators for the entire trip: We completely understand that this is out of Alexey's control. This is an old building so it was not a surprise. That said, we wish Alexey informed us about the broken elevator in advance. One of the neighbours mentioned that the elevator was broken for a few days and it's not an uncommon thing for it to happen to the building. Carrying 2 luggages + carry on to the 8th floor was extremely challenging. Please watch out if you are carrying luggages or have a small family. \n\nInitial feedback given:  When we shared with you our initial feedback about the direction, elevators and the humidity in the room, Alexey's responsive was defensive instead of finding a solution.  He subsequently suggested that we could leave to a new hotel/airbnb with a full refund with receipt. We were taken by surprise because our feedback was honest and were simply looking to help him as a host. We were surprised to have read that message without any solutions. It felt like he'd  rather have us leave so that he can avoid any possible reviews."},{"_id":"359753720","date":{"$date":"2018-12-17T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"20906161","reviewer_id":"161897255","reviewer_name":"James","comments":"Neat, tidy, stylish and convenient.

Alexey (the host) was very helpful and quick to respond to the issue, refunding the rest of our stay. The lift was fixed the next day, but by then we'd booked the hotel already. \n\nOn the upside, the apartment is as per the pics. Very clean, the mattress was comfy and lots of space in the apartment. Nice white wine on arrival too. The location is great, but do pack ear plugs if you're a light sleeper - right opposite Central train station, which is very busy.

In this street there is a city bike station which was quite useful for us to discover the city.\r\nOn the downside I would say the use of the heating system was a bit strange because there were nights that we were sweating and had to open a window. Also if you are looking for glamour this is not the place, it is clean but the furniture is there to be useful not pretty.

Die Lage der Wohnung ist top, ca. 15 Minuten zu Fuss zum Times Square und 3 Minuten zur Penn Station.\r\nObwohl die Wohnung direkt an der Strasse liegt, kann man nachts gut schlafen und es ist erstaunlich ruhig. Einzig die hereinkommenden Bewohner hört man ziemlich gut.\r\nBei unserer Ankunft war die Wohnung leider nicht gereinigt und mussten dies somit selber machen. Michael kam uns hierfür entgegen und brachte uns einen Staubsauger zur Benützung während des gesamten Aufenthalts.\r\nWir hatten zudem mehrmals Besuch von Kakerlaken.

Very basic, but it was fine for us since we didn't spend much time there. Michael was very responsive throughout the summer and checked in with me several times to make sure things were going smoothly. The building super, Tommy, was also helpful when issues came up. Would recommend to students / young adults working in the city short-term.

The only thing is the low flow toilet which clogs sometimes but Micheal will always come to help quickly when it occurred.

Having our own in suite laundry was great for a long stay and the barbecues on the roof provided a great location to relax and enjoy a sunset. That said, the showers behind the curtains could use some updating and we did have some visitor geckos for our stay inside the condo which we weren't used to.

The view was fantastic, apartment was quiet, Debbie was great with communication and it was well stocked with general kitchen amenities. We love to cook, so this was a huge bonus.\nBut by far the best part was that they had beach gear including snorkels, boogie boards, towels, beach toys and beach chairs for us to use while on vacation. \nBelow the apartment is a beach that usually has no more than 4 people on it(no tourists and not crowded) and in front of the complex is a cove(an acorns fishing cove), perfect for our whole family. Fairly shallow, protected from the waves, and full of fish and other Maui sea life. Not to mention sea turtles from morning til night. We literally swam with them every day and they easily won our hearts. \nTraditional Maui boats get launched here and I’m sure you can book a ride on them but we didn’t have time. Too busy relaxing! Nice pool but the cove was too exciting so we never tried it out.\nWe loved the location and would absolutely return (and hopefully will) in a heartbeat. \nBe sure to visit Ululani’s shave ice down the street! Best on the island. \nA true air bnb that feels like home from the minute you arrive."},{"_id":"302616090","date":{"$date":"2018-08-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"20994775","reviewer_id":"29199905","reviewer_name":"Simon","comments":"Debbie’s place was awesome!

The kids enjoyed swimming in the pool after dark. while we used the bbqs to make dinner. the shuffle board was fun too. The beach was beautiful and not many people on it we were the only ones a few times when we wanted more waves  we just drove down the beach a couple miles to charley young and kamaole beach 3 for bigger waves to body board. We have traveled around the island this trip and I have to say kehei is my favorite area, relaxed pace, great beaches, every thing you need within a mile or two. We had a couple issues with appliances and being a holiday weekend they couldn’t be resolved timely however Deb was in communication and worked hard to find solutions. Yes we would stay again, We couldn’t ask for a better Vacation spot."}]}

U can communicate with him through (Hidden by Airbnb) .. Aline was also reachable by texting, even before the trip..\nThe apt is located at Ribeira near the Douro river, so it’s close to the seafood restaurants by the river.. It’s also walkable to the Luis I Bridge..\nIf u wanna catch the hop on hop off bus, I’d suggest u go to the Ribeira stop coz it’s downhill, however Se Cathedral is also walkable, eventhough it’s uphill..\nThere r supermarkets like 3mins walk to both sides of the apt..\nThe apt itself is super nice! Modern look and clean.. The kitchenette is equipped with basic amenities.. They have hairdryer, good wifi, tea, coffee, and some other basic stuff u need for traveling..\n1 thing that can be improved, about the portable heater.. It was still winter at end of Feb, and the temp rise from night till morning, so it got a bit colder around 6 degrees.. There is a small mirror in the bathroom, but a big mirror would be a plus.. And bedroom sandal would also be a plus since it was kinda cold..\nOverall it was a really good stay and we’d recommend this place for sure!"},{"_id":"239352066","date":{"$date":"2018-03-01T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"21066228","reviewer_id":"124703567","reviewer_name":"Kris","comments":"Nice and clean apartment.

I stay in Airbnb locations a number of times a year, each of them different with their own quirkiness but this was by far the worst place I have ever stayed in on an overall experience perspective. The stay was completely unauthentic and does not represent what Airbnb means to me which is staying like a local and ability to live in a homely place with all relevant items of a home. This place was neither. Aline's apartment and 'experience' is extremely commercialised and more like staying in a hotel but with none of the benefits of a hotel. The check in with Aline was particularly difficult and to a very poor standard. Whenever I stay in an Airbnb I provide them with my mobile number in case my flight is delayed. In this instance my flight was delayed by over an hour which I text Aline to let her know of and that I would text her when we landed and also when we were on a taxi to her place. Not one message was acknowledged and no communication was received. Aline had outlined she would meet us outside the apartment. However, as I was abroad I did not have roaming and could not use the internet. We arrived at the apartment to no one there and the gate being key or code access. I then had to treck to Starbucks up the road to get into the Wi-Fi to see if anything had been received from Aline, despite my four text messages to her that day. Aline had messaged me on the code for the front door and the apartment which we were then able to gain access, after some effort. We didn't receive any communication from Aline to see if we had checked in successfully, so instead I let her know we were in. The apartment is on the second floor and has a cafe right beside the front door to the entrance. While the cafe is open the customers literally sit at the front door to the apartment block. There is no air-conditioning in the apartment and no fans either. Both nights we stayed were extremely warm and there is also no window in the bedroom to allow some air to come in. Instead we had to open the front windows to cool the apartment. The street noise was unbearable and went on til 4am both nights. Morning traffic starts again around 6am. This was two of the worst nights sleep I have ever had due to the noise and heat of the apartment. There is no oven in the apartment, only a microwave and very very limited utensiles/ items. There's 4 mugs, 4 glasses and little cooking items. This apartment has no lived in sense and seems to only have been utilised to rent out on short term stays. There is also no window in the bathroom which means a lot of..."},{"_id":"304310503","date":{"$date":"2018-08-09T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"21066228","reviewer_id":"121851","reviewer_name":"Janete","comments":"Beautiful and spacious apartment in the center of town.

This is quite clearly a serviced apartment masquerading as an Airbnb. It is not lived in and you will notice that when you arrive. It looks great in photos - and by all means does in real life too. Though the communication between myself and Aline was non existent. I spent most of my time talking to someone called Joana? She must manage the apartment for Dixos - have a look at their profile pictures they’re all the same (lol). After initially being told someone would meet us at the apartment, the day before Joana informed us that she would no longer be able to do so. The key would be waiting for us in a lockbox attached to the door. On arrival there was no key in the lockbox. Always a great start when visiting a new city. After messaging and calling the owner for 20 minutes the owner frantically responded with a variety of excuses (I couldn’t really understand). Though assured us that someone was on the way asap. 30 minutes after that a woman arrived with a key to let us in. She didn’t say hello or introduce herself - just went straight to the door and unlocked it. Asking her what had happened she laughed responding ‘I guess someone forgot to put it in’. Bizarre. Not even sure who she was.. maybe Joana? Maybe someone else. Oh well. Let’s get to the fun part - like sleeping? That’s a shame. This place is conveniently placed amongst the buzz in Porto, there’s no doubt about that. The street is a major thoroughfare for tourists and aggressive taxi drivers. This will be busy almost 24/7 during summer. During the hot weather with no fan or air conditioning, the only way to cool the apartment is by opening the windows to the street. I spent most of the night frequenting the window to cool the apartment and then having close them due to the excessive noise. This place is ridiculous. I’ve had some of the worst sleeps of my life. You’ll hear the locals yelling at each other across the street. Drunk tourists singing their favourite tunes. Taxi drivers beeping furiously at tourists trying to cross the street. I can imagine this is less of an issue during winter (maybe?). We were also pleasantly surprised with someone ringing the doorbell at 4:45am on our final night. Absolutely scared my girlfriend which was fun. Oh, and don’t be fooled by the other comments regarding the great ‘local suggestions’ either. They’ve cleaned out their local tourist center and have a bunch of pamphlets. Great right? Nah. The idea of Airbnb is that you get that ‘personal touch’ from the locals. This is everything but. Feels more like a British ex-pat trying to make some side cash from his Portuguese investment. I would suggest staying in a hotel as it’s of relative cost - you’ll essentially get the same thing PLUS air-conditioning and the bonus service..."},{"_id":"313489916","date":{"$date":"2018-08-25T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"21066228","reviewer_id":"70164941","reviewer_name":"Hiral","comments":"Great location!

The apartment itself is just lovely - very spacious and clean and the decor is fab! We loved the little balcony for eating breakfast in the morning. Communication with Aline was excellent - very quick responses and so helpful. We were also left a map inside the apartment which was marked up with places to visit and this came in really handy.

Doing the check-in and check-out was easy, and we were given plenty of information and recommendations for the city. The flat was nicely decorated and had everything we needed. The one thing we didn’t like, however, is that the apartment feels quite cold. We know it’s January, but with only a little heater it was impossible to have a warm apartment and that subtracted noticeably from our experience (the only reason we don’t put five stars).

Rainey communicated very well and we had no questions, she was proactive in letting us know everything we needed to. We honestly did not spend much time at the house because we were off adventuring during the day, but it was always nice to come \"home\" to this cozy place. She even left a bow of local fruit on the door step when we got back from the beach. As for cooking, there were plenty of utensils/plates/pots/pans for us to use AND she even had basic condiments in the fridge, which I thought was grand. We ended up leaving a bottle of champagne in the fridge because we ran out of time to drink it haha, so whoever was after us I hope you enjoyed it! Thanks for the place, Rainey.

You'll probably want a car if you stay here so you can get around the island. Although you *can* get by without there is very little to eat or do nearby other than walk down to one of the local beaches. My only *very minor* gripe is that the description somehow gave me the impression that this place was right on the beach, and that you could sit and watch the waves from the balcony. This isn't the case as the house is set and the end of a street a couple of blocks from the beach.

Here, you are clearly paying for location and not for the quality of the home itself, which is a very modest 70s/80s-era structure. That said, the place was true to its locale and, after realizing how close it was to walk to Ted's Bakery and Sunset Beach, we enjoyed our stay. We definitely prefer to be closer to windward side / Kahuku so, again, location is good. The beach photo in the ad is a bit misleading though - this home is not on the beach - but is a relatively short walk away down the street, across Kam Hwy, and through a public access lane. So, while not luxurious, it's a clean, relaxing place, near some of the most beautiful beaches on Oahu, and close to good food at Ted's (and the fabulous Brazilian food truck down the road AND Fiji market in Kahuku).

The apartment works perfectly for those on a surf safari or for a family looking to enjoy the beaches on the North Shore, we being the latter. We enjoyed a take out meal from Ted's one night, but be careful walking the busy road to the bakery at night. A great place to stay, with access to Waikiki Beach (sixty minute drive) if you want it."},{"_id":"27930829","date":{"$date":"2015-03-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"210968","reviewer_id":"27080670","reviewer_name":"Jamie","comments":"Great place, great location and great communication from Rainey.

We wanted quiet, peaceful, and relaxation, and that was exactly what we got. Everything Rainey described about her home was accurate and even better than we imagined. The walk to the beach was short, and it was amazing being on such a beautiful beach with no more than 5 people on it at a time. It was paradise. There were also other beautiful beaches a short drive away with more people, but we loved being so close to such a feeling of a \"private paradise.\" Rainey's house was also a short drive to the infamous food trucks, Food Land, the Coffee Bean, and about a 20 minute drive to downtown Haleiwa. Renting a car is definitely a necessity, but we did walk to Ted's Bakery many times and walked to the food trucks (about 3 miles) when we wanted a little more exercise. Rainey's house is also right by the bike path (about 4 miles long) which made for beautiful morning runs. Rainey provided everything we needed - beach chairs, towels, cooking utensils. She was also an amazing host as she gave us our space, but responded quickly to texts when needed!

That helped so much as we were navigating two children across the island and trying to figure out where we would be in the middle of the day. \r\n\r\nThe place made all the North Shore sites accessible and provided necessities. It was hot when we were there but Rainey provided many good fans and the place catches the breezes nicely. \r\n\r\nThere are a few quirks. The screens don't all fit perfectly and rain comes in the side windows so you have to leave them closed. We used some duct tape to close up the obvious holes and then had no problems. \r\n\r\nAs someone mentioned, the sleeping area has a low ceiling and even lower beam running the length of it. Didn't bother me but it makes the space just for sleeping, not hanging out. \r\n\r\nLoved that there was a gang of about ten children that gathered in the evening in the cul de sac and played.\r\n\r\nSandy's sandwiches (the little green truck nearby) is sometimes not there on Sundays, in case you're looking. \r\n\r\nWith young children you won't likely use the beach that you can walk to (V land?). We drove the few minutes to Waimaea and Sunset for wonderful beach days. We had a lovely stay.

Die Unterkunft war sauber. Die Küche war gut ausgestattet. Die Betten / Matratzen waren von hoher Qualität, 1+! Waschmaschine und Trockner waren sehr von Vorteil und jederzeit frei zugänglich. Die Außendusche ist ebenfalls sehr praktisch und vor allem notwendig, der hawaiianische Sand klebt immens. Rainey stellte viele Handtücher und Strandtücher zur Verfügung. Ebenso stellte sie z.B. Strandstühle, Boogie Boards, Schnorchelausrüstung, etc. zur Verfügung. Der Strand (baden, surfen) ist in drei Minuten zu Fuß erreicht. Wir fühlten uns sehr sicher in dem Haus. Die Nachbarschaft gibt typische Geräusche (Hunde, spielende Kinder, Gartenarbeiten, Müllabfuhr, etc.) her. Für uns war es fremd, dass auch am Wochenende laute Geräusche wie flexen, sägen, etc. normal sind. Nicht gefallen haben uns der Aufgang und der Balkon. Der Balkon sieht nicht mehr wie auf dem Foto aus. Er war sehr dreckig (spackig), die Boogie Boards, Strandstühle etc. nicht aufgeräumt, sondern ein Wirrwarr aus Sachen. Ein zerbrochener Stuhl nahm dort ebenfalls Platz weg. Die Treppe und der Balkon waren extrem rutschig, wenn es nass war! Keine Gummimatten oder Stopper, auch nicht auf den Stufen, das war fast schon gefährlich (die Gummimatte, die auf dem Foto zu sehen ist, gab es nicht (mehr?)).

I was able to walk to Velzyland beach at the break of dawn on a Sunday morning and it was a quick 5 minute walk! The bathroom was clean and the kitchen was well stocked (we were stoked to see that there were wine glasses, a coffee maker, and a toaster!). The beds upstairs were soft and comfy. The only thing that my friends had a slight problem with was that the wiFi was a bit spotty at times, but I never seemed to have a problem. We did not see Rainey during our stay, but she was very accommodating and was responsive to our questions. Highly recommend staying at this North Shore loft.

Muy completa, tiene hasta artículos de playa. Lo único que hay que llevar es algo de ropa y ya. La casa es amplia y cómoda.\nRainey fue siempre amable, desde antes de alojarnos hasta su saludo posterior. Además de envirte indicaciones clarísimas sobre la llegada y acceso a la casa. Incluso fue comprensiva con nosotros. Recomendable sin dudas. Y si lo que buscas es una casa para surf, esta es la opción sin dudas.

Just remember to watch your head in the loft,  as well take care when you climb the little,  windy metal stairs leading up there.  Otherwise,  a relaxing place for a getaway.

There's only one major road in and out in either direction, so expect traffic. Fortunately, there's plenty to do nearby, including snorkeling, rock jumping, surfing, and of course, swimming. The food options are of the truck and shack variety, but that can be charming. The loft itself is modest, but simple things like separate rooms and a w/d combo were much appreciated. There's no A/C, as the listing indicates, but all you have to do is open the windows and let the sea breeze take care of things.\r\n\r\nThe neighborhood was very much local, ending in a cul-de-sac with neighbors in their yards and on their porches each evening.

Walking distance to the beach (5 mins ) , just crossing the street was great for our morning walks and swimming at the beach. Close to all other famous beaches at north shore with only few minutes drive . Also conveniently close to foodland and a bakery . The house is at the back of a quiet street. House itself very simple with basic furniture for the basics. Beds are located upstairs with rather clumsy access by spiral metal stairs and ceilings are low so have to bend to walk about . Not a lot of wardrobes and furniture too. Only thing really bothered us was the fact the house had no AC units anywhere which made temperatures inside considerably hot during afternoon ( house gets afternoon sun).\nAt night we opened windows and let sea breeze in which was rather nice . Overall good cost benefit. Loved seating at front porch at night to relax after spending many hours at the beach ."},{"_id":"168595366","date":{"$date":"2017-07-09T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"210968","reviewer_id":"7905574","reviewer_name":"Sara","comments":"Rainey was an amazing host!

There is a little patio with some chairs to relax in as well as a great place to hang towels and clothes to dry after a day at the beach. \n\nI called Rainey a week before check in because another Airbnb cancelled on some of my friends who were also staying in the area for a wedding.

The Plateau is characterized by brightly colored houses, cafés, book shops, and a laissez-faire attitude. It's the location of some famous attractions on Saint Laurent Boulevard, including Schwartz's Deli (famous for its Montreal smoked meat), and a weekend street fair during the summer that sees extremely crowded streets. In 1997, Utne Reader rated it one of the 15 \"hippest\" neighborhoods in North America. The neighbourhoods of Mile End, Côte Saint-Louis, and Milton-Parc (including the McGill Ghetto) are also located in the borough. Montreal's Little Portugal neighbourhood is situated in the western portion of the borough. The borough is largely composed of the well-known Plateau neighbourhood, famous for its bohemian reputation and characteristic architecture.

Although there was hair on the toilet and in the shower the place was clean-ish, the bed was very comfortable and room very well decorated. The only complaint I have is that both nights I fell asleep early, like around 10pm and on both nights I was woken up by loud voices (mainly female) around midnight and then realized there was also a dog running around. When it happened the second night I went out to ask the hosts to please be quiet and they immediately were quiet. If I didn’t have to get up early I wouldn’t really care, but both mornings I had to wake up super early so it was a bit of a shame to have a broken sleep.

Our main issue was that we did not get any keys for our room which felt quite unsafe since there are 4 other rooms in the apartment where unknown people lived. It was unpleasant to not be able to lock the door while sleeping or being out of the house. Also we asked for the keys both via text and by calling the emergency number. We got the information that there was no keys for the room we were staying in. After checking out thogh the host contacted me to ask where I put the keys. This is not a major problem but it is very unprofessional to not provide keys for the guests and later proceed to ask them for the non-exciting keys."}]}

It's full of charming old houses, has a tram and lot's of street art. It is known as an artistic neighbourhood since many artists have their ateliers here.

Davi and me bought this big old house that needed a lot of work to be done. We renovated it completely and tried to keep it as original as possible. We did most of the work ourselves, so it took about 4 years to complete it. Since we had more space than we needed, we decided to give Airbnb a try and it's being a really good experience since. We have been lucky to have nice guests that share many common interests and have a fun time in the city.\r\n\r\nI work also with photography (artistic, street) and some graphic design. Davi works as a carpenter building furniture. Most of the house's furniture was made by him.

From there it is easy and cheap to explore the city's attractions by bus. We felt safe in the area, even if we have came home after sunset.\r\n\r\nWe spent one week at Ewa and Davi’s house and were very warmly welcomed. Both were glad to assist us in any possible way and gave us a lot of helpful informations to the city. Great was as well the small guide, written by Ewa, containing small walking tours through the quarters of Rio.\r\n\r\nThe rooms are located in an old building that has been affectionately renovated by the two. The photos in the profile give a realistic impression of the accomodation.\r\nThe rooms and the public areas were clean of great amenity value. Convenient for us was the fully equipped kitchen that we could use at any time.\r\n\r\nThe highlight of the day was the excellent breakfast. We could not even make it better. It contained the best home-baked bread, fresh fruit juices, french cheese, fruits, cereals, eggs, ... \r\nAnd even though we were there for one week, some individual components of the breakfast vary, so there was always something new to discover.\r\n\r\nWe would warmly recommend this accommodation to each of our friends and can not wait to come back ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\nDas Haus liegt zentral in dem charmanten Stadtviertel Santa Teresa. Von dort kann man gut und günstig mit dem Bus alle Sehenswürdigkeiten der Stadt erkunden. Wir haben uns in der Gegend sicher gefühlt, selbst wenn wir erst im Dunkeln nach Hause gekommen sind.\r\n\r\nWir haben eine Woche bei Ewa und Davi verbracht und wurden sehr herzlich aufgenommen. Die Beiden standen uns bei allen Fragen mit Rat und Tat zur Seite und konnten uns jede Menge hilfreicher Tipps zur Stadt geben. Toll war auch der eigens verfasste kleine Reiseführer von Ewa, mit kleinen Stadtrundgängen durch die einzelnen Viertel Rios. \r\n\r\nDie Zimmer befinden sich in einem Altbau, der von den Beiden liebevoll renoviert wurde. Die Fotos im Profil geben einen realistischen Eindruck von den Räumlichkeiten wieder.\r\nDas Zimmer, sowie die allgemeinen Räume waren von großer Aufenthaltsqualität und vorbildlich sauber. Praktisch für uns war die voll ausgestattete Küche, die wir jederzeit benutzen konnten.\r\n\r\nDas Highlight des Tages war das grandiose Frühstück. Man könnte es selbst nicht besser machen. Es gab die besten selbst gebackenen Brötchen, frische Fruchtsäfte, französischer Käse, Obst, Müsli, Eier, … Und obwohl wir eine Woche dort waren, variierten einzelne Komponenten des Frühstückes, sodass es immer wieder etwas neues zu entdecken gab.\r\n\r\nWir würden jedem unserer Freunde diese Unterkunft empfehlen und können es kaum erwarten selbst wieder zu kommen.\r\n"},{"_id":"10109869","date":{"$date":"2014-01-31T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2116352","reviewer_id":"6162503","reviewer_name":"Pete","comments":"Great place in the coolest neighbourhood.

She offered us breakfast and a chance to shower even though we had not stayed there the night before. The place looks exactly as it appeared in the photos. The design is perfect and you can tell Ewa and David put a lot of thought into it. David designed and made almost all the furniture in their place.  Our room was a good size, had a hammock that we used every day, and two big windows with amazing views. There are two bathrooms, both with brand new fixtures, and great design as well!  Breakfast was amazing! It was the best I have had in Brazil. Homemade bread, fruit, meats, cheeses, fresh juices, and other things that kind of vary day to day. Ewa also makes an amazing cup of coffee with steamed milk that she offered to us throughout the day. She also hand made books and maps highlighting cool things to do in Rio De Janeiro and Santa Teresa which we used every day we were there. Her husband David is from Rio and gave us lots of good tips and ideas about what to do as well. \nThis was our first time using Airbnb and weren't quite sure what to expect but were more than satisfied with our stay, in fact, I can't even imagine there being a better place to stay in Rio. We will definitely stay there again!\n\nThe house is located at the top of a hill in Santa Teresa. It is quite a climb to get there, but that didn't stop us from wanted to go out and do stuff. We walked around the neighborhood quite a bit actually and really enjoyed the location. We felt pretty safe too, which is a big plus. Can't say enough good things about Ewa and David's ace so I will just leave it at that!"},{"_id":"11024452","date":{"$date":"2014-03-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2116352","reviewer_id":"1727184","reviewer_name":"Matan","comments":"Among our 30 nights in Brazil, the 3 nights at Ewa's place were THE BEST! \r\nFirstly- super welcoming and friendly hospitality!\r\nThe room itself was very clean, inviting and beautifully designed (Ewa and Davi designed and built most of the furniture).\r\nBlankets and towels were super comfortable.

They are restoring a circa-1918 house in Santa Teresa, which is an artsy neighbourhood with several bars and interesting restaurants. If you love historical Brazilian/Portuguese architecture as I do, you will feel in heaven. I really enjoyed wandering the streets nearby, and there are some excellent views overlooking the city. What’s more, as other guests have noted, the included breakfast is fantastic. It includes home-made rolls, fresh juice and good coffee, tons of fruit, pao de queijo and other items. Ewa makes sure to add some variety if you are staying for longer than a few days. Ewa and Davi were happy to offer suggestions, practical advice, and any assistance really, during my stay. Ewa has produced her own mini-guides that list suggestions of sites in several of Rio’s neighbourhoods. They are doing a nice job with restoring the house, and each of the rooms look comfortable.

I chose Ewa’s place based mainly on the beautiful pictures of the place (image culture forever) on the airbnb website. \r\n\r\nI want to talk about a few things in this review: 1) Santa Teresa (aka, Ewa’s neighborhood), 2) the House (capitalized!), 3) Ewa and Davie. \r\n\r\n1) Santa Teresa. Different people who'd been recommended staying here, even though it’s much closer to the city center (Centro) than it is to Ipanema/Copacabana. It’s a beautiful neighborhood and there are small shops, restaurants, galleries, and bars, but people LIVE there, making it vibrant. It’s also VERY hilly and walking around in that neighborhood gives you a new appreciation for what I imagine taking walks in the (US) Midwest is like. But the views! Every corner there’s a new one, there’s wall-art everywhere, houses are gorgeous. Gloria is (I believe) the closest metro station and it’s a little bit of a hike ~25 minutes of leisurely walk and uphill on the way back. It’s also kind of easy to get lost because the roads turn into different roads, double back on themselves, and just in general, hilly terrain isn’t the easiest for finding your way. That being said, getting there and away was always an adventure in map-reading and you develop a feel for the directions VERY quickly (because you have to), which feels like what exploring other places is supposed to feel like. Loved Santa.\r\n\r\n2) the House. OMG THE HOUSE. It’s so beautiful, Ewa and Davie have spent so much care and time on decoration and design. The place is one of the most beautiful, thoughtful living spaces I’ve ever seen. Sounds like hyperbole. Isn’t. Both of them MADE (WITH THEIR HANDS!) the tables in the common/kitchen/living space, and Davie taught me a lot about the different types of brazilian wood (there are so many). Oh and he made the beautiful bed frames. The love that went into this place is palpable and makes the house an above and beyond great place to stay. Hammocks and fans in every room, but no AC. Not a deal breaker, just good knowledge to have going to Rio (say, if you’re sensitive and can’t sleep if the ambient temperature isn’t down to your needs).\r\n\r\n3) Ewa and Davie. So friendly, so helpful, made delicious, delicious breakfast (freshly baked bread!?). Told us lots of stories, gave us advice when we needed it, were hands-off when we wanted to fly free or just pass out in our room hammock. Basically, the perfect hosts. We weren’t the only guests while we were staying there (they have several rooms on airbnb) and that was awesome too. We chatted with the travelers over coffee at beautiful tables hand-made out of reclaimed brazilian wood. It didn’t get much better than staying with them, I’d love to do it again!

For all that they have used 'pinho de riga', a kind of wood that is rare to find  nowadays in Brasil, but of which there was plenty in the original structure of this house. The windows restoration is quite impressive, and I feel that like that, with no painting, showing their simply beautiful veins, they get to be prettier that ever - and also make a good symbol of the concept there seems do be behind every decision made to make this house rebirth. \r\nDuring our 3 days we had the sensation that Santa Teresa is a good travel destiny on its own, and spending some night and days just there could be refreshing even for a carioca."},{"_id":"23801379","date":{"$date":"2014-12-10T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2116352","reviewer_id":"2726777","reviewer_name":"Dasha","comments":"Ewa and Davi were the most wonderful hosts. When we arrived a lot later than expected on Friday night trying to figure out the address in the dark, Ewa came out onto the street and welcomed us. She offered us water and cake, we really felt right at home. The breakfast in the morning was everything we could have asked for - fresh juices, coffee, home made bread, cheeses, fruit, cereal, yogurt... amazing. Right away, Ewa was very friendly and extremely helpful with her advice. She has made special brochures for every neighbourhood in Rio worth visiting with personal recommendations of places to check out, eat at, etc. We ended up using them on daily basis and they sure came in handy. \r\nThe house is a colonial jewel, bright,clean and spacious rooms with a touch of contemporary design. So pleasant to chill at, it must have been one of the reasons we had really long breakfasts. The location  -Santa Teresa is a true find for anyone with appreciation of art and architecture. There is a myriad of local shops, bars and restaurants around that are really worth checking out, during the day and in the evening. \r\nWe originally booked for five nights as we thought it'll be sufficient for Rio, but then we liked it so much we stayed five extra nights. Ewa and Davi's home and company was definitely part of the amazing vacation feel, and I'm really thankful to them. They truly care about their guests having a great time and leaving with the best impression and memories of their magnificent city.

They are also very good in giving advise on where to go, which areas to explore and which restaurants, cafes, museums etc to visit. In the morning, Ewa prepares wonderful breakfast with self-made fresh bread rolls, fresh juice, yoghurt, eggs and everything one could hope for - honestly the best breakfast we had in a long time. Santa Teresa itself is a beautiful suburb of Rio de Janeiro, with nice little cafes, restaurants and bars. There is loads of graffiti art, colonial buildings and beautiful gardens to explore.

Davi machte uns einen verfrühten Check-in möglich, so dass wir unser Gepäck schon abstellen konnten, empfing uns mit frischgepresstem Saft und auch eine spätere Check-Out-Zeit vereinfachte uns das Reisen mit den Backpacks enorm. Davi ist Brasilianer, spricht super deutsch, backt morgens leckere, frische Brötchen, mixt tolle Fruchtsäfte , wartet mit Insider-Tipps auf und ist super entspannt und hilfsbereit.  Das Haus ist liebevoll renoviert, die Einrichtung hochwertig, noch schöner als es auf den Fotos zu sehen ist und die Betten sind ultra bequem.

The house is in Santa Teresa, a beautiful and bohemian enclave of Rio on a hill overlooking Centro and Lapa (near to all of the samba bars and clubs). Exploring the neighbourhood was fantastic and it's close to the famous Santa Teresa tram (bonde). \n\nEwa's place itself is a beautiful converted townhouse, with designer touches throughout. Amazing ceramic tiles, cool furniture and light fittings with Ewa's own photography on the wall. She lives upstairs so is always available but also gives you space if you need it. \n\nEwa was super helpful throughout; she's designed and printed her own guides to each area of Rio which were a great local's way of exploring the city. She kindly did some laundry for us at no extra cost and printed off bus tickets. Nothing was too much trouble! \n\nThe room was clean and comfortable with a hammock and pretty wooden shutters. There's a fan which made sleeping no problem. \n\nAnd then there's the breakfast! Truly unbelievable. Each morning Ewa would put out freshly baked homemade bread, cured meats, cheeses, fresh fruit and yoghurt with coffee and homemade juice. It saved us a lot of money and was truly delicious! \n\nAs you can tell I could gush about this place all day. The touristy areas of Ipanema and Copacabana are full of faceless tower blocks; staying here will give you a real taste of old Rio at a very reasonable price.

I'd definitely recommend their place for a short stay in Rio \u0026 would return myself in future.\nOne thing to note is that Santa Teresa is a bit removed from the rest of Rio.

We had no way to really contact the airline and no contact info to leave for them to reach us but Savas went above and beyond and took it upon himself to make sure my bag was delivered. He must have been on the phone with the airline for hours and kept giving us updates and finally the airline came through and delivered my bag. We were only in Istanbul 2 days before going on with the rest of the trip to Greece and without his tenacity and help with the airlines I honestly don't think I would have my bag back. The apartment is on the smaller side, but was what we had expected and is as described. I couldn't have asked for a better experience and thank you so much Savas for your help!

The guestroom is on the ground floor with large windows to the quiet road offering plenty of light. Feels clean and fresh, as recently renovated. The shower room has a nice shower with good water pressure.\r\n\r\nBuilding is a nice characterful historical townhouse, with a roof-terrace offering excellent views of the estuary and sea, and the mosque. We were met in the building by Mustafa, who was really helpful and polite. We didn't get to meet Savas, but he was really helpful during the booking process. The building has about 5 rooms, but feels private - we only met other guests twice in four days. It feels like a boutique hotel without all the restrictions of a hotel. Location is incredible - in a local-feeling residential area, about 10 minutes' walk from the Blue Mosque. Tea shop (only 1 lira a glass) and a couple of small grocery shops on the street, and friendly local people. Excellent value for money.

Highly recommend to visit the Bascillica Cistern and walk Istiklal Cadessi (from Taksim Square downhill).  If you want to experience an authentic Turkish Bath without the tourist price, catch a tram to Yusufpasa Tram Stop, find the other side of the main road past Aksaray Train St., wander up Sofula Cadessi, under the bridge and Sofula Hamam is on your right - the best (55TL + tip).

The roof deck view exceeded my expectations and it was very relaxing to spend time up there in the evening (and during the day).

Рядом магазинчики, рестораны на каждом углу. До моря 3 минуты ходьбы, можно выйти на классную набережную. Поднимитесь на крышу! Наверху открывается потрясающий вид на море и Голубую Мечеть. Наверху есть маленькая кухня, где можно сделать чай/кофе. Комната красивая, стильная, уютная, что не скажешь о кровати. Нам было крайне неудобно, матрас \"деревянный\". Во время нашего проживания случился потоп: прорвало трубу на крыше, и вся вода лилась по лестнице куда-то вниз. Хорошо, что не залила номера (не уверены насчёт номера на цокольном этаже). В здании не было никого, я звонила хозяину, отправила ему видео и сообщение. Муж метался по округе, чтобы понять, где найти кого-то, чтобы остановить потоп. Хорошо, что минут через 40 пришла женщина, которая нас заселяла и стала метаться вместо мужа. За реагирование на проблему жирный минус. Понимаем, что потоп - не вина хозяина, но вот реагирование на проблему (тем более такого масштаба) могло бы быть более быстрым. Хотя справедливости ради отмечу, что когда в ванной перестал работать слив унитаза, а также были перебои с горячей водой (её не было), я написала хозяину, к вечеру проблемы были устранены. В общем, рекомендовать не стала бы. Но если решите заезжать, берите беруши, т.к. слышимость очень хорошая. \nИтог. Плюсы: вид, комната, расположение, инфраструктура. Минусы: общение (ситуация с потопом), матрас, слышимость."},{"_id":"242538705","date":{"$date":"2018-03-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2118641","reviewer_id":"12625293","reviewer_name":"Otar","comments":"Nice location"},{"_id":"246268135","date":{"$date":"2018-03-25T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2118641","reviewer_id":"42819633","reviewer_name":"John","comments":"Very nice place in the middle of the old town."},{"_id":"248340423","date":{"$date":"2018-03-31T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2118641","reviewer_id":"138984250","reviewer_name":"Leyla","comments":"Great location, just 5-10 mins walk to blue mosque :) Nice and clean and comfy :)"},{"_id":"254835400","date":{"$date":"2018-04-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2118641","reviewer_id":"120617499","reviewer_name":"Samantha","comments":"Savas place was perfect for seeing the sights in Sultanahmet!

Appartement très bien situé dans Copacabana, à 7-8 min à pied de la plage, et à 2-3 min du Métro. Communication avec Adriano parfaite. Appartement cosy mais quelques points négatifs tout de même. \nVoici les points négatifs, une des fenêtres du salon reste en permanence ouverte, pour y laisser passer un tuyau de l'évacuation de la climatisation, bref, Isolation du bruit et du froid à l'extérieur 0/10. L'appartement se trouve au rez de chaussée, certes c'est l'idéal pour les bagages quand on arrive et pour ramener des courses, mais c'est au même endroit que se trouve un gardien (Jour et Nuit), et ils sont malheureusement un peu bruyant, donc un conseil, prenez des boules quies. La cuisine n'est vraiment pas fonctionnel, très peu de couverts, ou de verres, vraiment à renouveler. Et dernier point un peu effrayant je vous l'accorde, mais personnellement, nous aurions aimé le savoir en lisant les commentaires, il y a des cafards, et oui pas que un mais des, nous en avons trouvés 4 et pas des tout petits :-((((. Encore une fois Adriano, ce commentaire n'a rien contre vous, votre communication est parfaite, vous semblez être un gentil garçon, mais honnêtement le statut de SuperHost est à mes yeux un peu exagéré. Il y pas mal de choses à améliorer dans l'appartement.\nHere are the negatives, one of the windows of the living room is permanently open, to let pass a pipe of evacuation of the air conditioning, in short, Isolation of the noise and the cold outside 0/10. The apartment is on the ground floor, although it is ideal for luggage when arriving and to bring back shopping, but it is in the same place that there is a guard (Day and Night), and they are Unfortunately a bit noisy, so a tip, take earplugs. The kitchen is really not functional, very few cutlery, or glasses, really to renew.

Check in itself was okay. We were able to check in early which was nice but in order to do so we had to go to the company's office (nowhere near the unit) to pick up the keys. However, we did appreciate being able to get the keys early. We were told the company very recently acquired this unit so we expected it would be in good shape. Unfortunately it seemed they knew very little about the unit and it didn't seem ready for guests. The living room (and basically whole unit) smelled of smoke and burnt coal - I think it was coming from the fire place in the living room. I have no idea when it was last cleaned. We were looking forward to having a kitchen to have our own breakfast in and maybe cook dinner etc. Unfortunately the kitchen was in bad shape. It was poorly stocked, things were simply thrown into a cupboard, and the fridge smelled strongly of something rotten. Needless to say we opted not to use the kitchen. There was also poor water pressure and very unreliable hot water (ie. One minute bursts of warm to hot water followed by immediately cold water). As a plus the company was receptive when we contacted them about the fridge and water but our stay was so short and we were hardly in the unit so did not want to spend much of our vacation time dealing with these issues. The company seems good but we wouldn't recommend this unit until they fix things up a bit. Also beware the location is very suburban and quite far from the center and main sights."},{"_id":"227813871","date":{"$date":"2018-01-16T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"21201544","reviewer_id":"63593274","reviewer_name":"Luis","comments":"Apesar de já ter usado bastante o serviço airbnb desta vez fiquei totalmente desagradado com o serviço, estivemos cerca de 1h30 para dar check in, no qual apos algumas questões sobre a área a nível de supermercados, não me souberam informar, puxadores da cozinha saiam foram quando tentamos aceder ao móvel, espelhos dos interruptores da luz também caíam quando utilizamos. \n\nEnfim algo para não voltar a repetir, sem dúvida."},{"_id":"238203457","date":{"$date":"2018-02-25T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"21201544","reviewer_id":"173835146","reviewer_name":"Bruna","comments":"Estive em Leça da Palmeira, em trabalho na Exponor ficando o apartamento muito perto!

The metro was only a 5 minute walk away and the Plateau is a few miles walk each way. The kitchen has a toaster and electric kettle. If you want to cook hot meals, you would have to bring all the basics, like cooking oil and salt and pepper, but . \n\nI really liked how close the apartment was to cute coffee shops and it's right next door to an excellent little vegetarian restaurant and a small used bookshop.

The bed was comfortable, and the living room very pleasant.  I did not really cook during my stay there, but I could have, as there was everything needed.

But we were sorely disappointed with the apartment in itself. Why? Because while the pictures correspond to what we were looking for, the actual place did not: the state of renovation is far from being as good as suggested by the description and pictures (ex: there was a big hole in the bathroom door, by the doorknob, that was filled with kitchen paper, and that is just one example); the place could use a deep clean and we were greeted by a hospital smell that we could not get rid of during our stay. If you are seduced by the idea of using the pool, beware: we love swimming and were planning to use it but did not because its cleanliness was very questionable (there were for example what seemed to be dead spiders at the bottom of it). This place is for people who want a place to sleep and be on their way."},{"_id":"327865219","date":{"$date":"2018-09-24T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"21204926","reviewer_id":"32574068","reviewer_name":"Nathalie","comments":"Great location but be ready to be in student housing.

The pictures are so misleading. It looks luxurious, it is nothing but. I so wish I could add in my own pictures, the actually reality of what this place looks like, for exemple an improperly installed bathroom door knob stuffed with toilet paper, and with visible screws. Filth on the walls, on the fan. A flimsy piece of plastic/cardboard in the top part of the window were the AC unit is installed. It felt so unsafe we did not leave any valuables every time we left the Airbnb. 2 towels for 5people for 3days 2nights (that includes the hand towel and then there is no mat for coming out of the shower, so basically that leaves no towels for showers, we used our own towels we’d brought for swimming) and when I asked for more towels that did nothappen , I was ignored completely on that request. But we ended up using our own towels, because we saw a beautiful pool in the pictures. Well turns out the pool wasn’t as expected at all. It was too cold to swim and the place looked like it was in need of repairs (holes in the ceiling) just bad! \nThe dresser had a broken drawer bottom, when I attempted to open the closet in the bedroom the knob came off in my hand, the closet door wasn’t on right and difficult to manage. The toilet didn’t flush properly, the bathroom sink was leaking and the caulking in the bathroom was coming apart and either dirty or moldy. The walls were filthy, I could see where posters had been on those walls in the past. Gross. \n\nThis is so dishonest. This is not right. \nAwful. Awful. Awful. \nYou want to rent your place, that’s fine. Don’t need to steal from honest people. Just sell what you have to offer, don’t mislead people and on top of it bully them into giving you a five star 5 rating. I paid. Therefor I have paid my right to say my honest opinion and I don’t want anyone else to get ripped off by you."},{"_id":"331796756","date":{"$date":"2018-10-03T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"21204926","reviewer_id":"215902982","reviewer_name":"Maggie","comments":"It is a clean and comfortable place to live and the host reply the message very fast.\nEspecially the location is very convenient to travel most of the tourist spot.

Carl was very helpful in providing us with suggestions on places to visit/dine, and responded fast to calls and texts! Furniture was nice, one bedroom with a bed and couch, living room with pull out couch, tv, and dining table, kitchen and patio available. The infrastructure of apartment and building was a bit old.

For the location (close to McGill) and the price point, I'm not surprised. It's an old building that desperately needs updating. Some fairly simple repairs are neglected in favour of shoving plastic bags and toilet paper into crevices or hiding them behind paintings. If you're only worried about location and price, it's a decent place to stay (maybe not in winter though).

If you’re looking for a beach holiday without sacrificing proximity to the city, This may be your best choice of Sydney accommodation. The beach stretches 1.8 kilometres, offering plenty of space for both locals and holidaymakers. This gorgeous shoreline is a mecca for couples and families alike with shower facilities, barbecues, a childrens' playground and terrific surfing conditions. The Dee Why SLSC patrol the beach each day. A fantastic bushwalk over the headland provides some sweeping views across the Tasman. If you need a break from the beach sun, head across the street and grab a table at any one of the many local restaurants or cafés with a great view of the surf instead. The beach’s promenade is also a fantastic place for a walk in the evenings.","notes":"The flat is best suited to a single or a couple, but within the flat there is a small, somewhat scruffy back storage room with a built-in single bed (listed here as 'bedroom 2', for lack of a better description).

Transportation was super easy; I’d recommend taking the bus early morning or late at night, otherwise, there’s lots of traffic. The line 1 (train/subway) is only a couple blocks away, which takes you pretty much anywhere in a short time (15-20 min). Also, there’s a park by the Hudson River also couple blocks away. \nWe really liked staying here as it gave us a better sense of the regular daily lives of residents rather than just seeing the craziness of NYC. \nErika was super kind and easy to reach via text. The only minor “complaint” is that the room is facing the street and it can get pretty loud, having us wake up in the middle of the night. I stayed with my mom, so we were home by midnight, but if you are out and about later than that, maybe the noise from outside won’t be an issue. \n\nThank you Erika!"},{"_id":"273283737","date":{"$date":"2018-06-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"21264297","reviewer_id":"19638945","reviewer_name":"Gretchen","comments":"I loved staying here.

It was such a treat for us to get into town using the ferry; we took the ferry to Barangaroo and Watson Bay for lunch and my son was over the moon.\n\nBen was also great organising things we needed for our baby, like a cot and baby booster seat, and provided little touches like toys, hair dryer, candles, heater in the bathroom etc.  (winter when we were there). It was also great that he stocked up! We arrived so late and were so hungry the first night we were grateful there were lots to eat in the fridge and snacks too!\n\nThe entertainment in this place is awesome, also large sofas great for entertaining if you have people over.  I love this location with options of cafes, restaurants, parks and the ferry close by.  We treated ourselves to Catalina on the last night and it was so romantic.  The only thing I wished for is a coffee machine for some good coffee.\n \nWe slept fine through the night, but for light sleepers the slight traffic noise is not ideal.  \n\nAll in all a great stay!"},{"_id":"325255038","date":{"$date":"2018-09-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"21281467","reviewer_id":"204094354","reviewer_name":"Elizabeth","comments":"The host canceled this reservation 8 days before arrival.

Here were some of the things that made it great: ocean view w balcony, fully stocked kitchen, 5 minute walk from 3 great beaches, awesome breakfast spot and the best grocery store on the island within walking distance, beach supplies included - umbrella, cooler, chairs and towels, the property is meticulously maintained and the 2 pools, BBQs and tennis courts are really nice.

I'm so glad I chose this instead of staying at the resorts in Lahaina. Property was very clean and comfortable. Location is close to beaches and restaurants. There is a conditioner in the unit but it is located in the living room so while it does a great job cooling that space, the air doesn't make it to the bedroom. We had the ceiling fan and table fan on all night and still found ourselves waking up sweating. I'm assuming this is the typical layout of apartments in Maui so just want to give everyone a heads up. Also, you may need to purchase more toilet paper. We stayed for 6 nights and ran out of toilet paper by the 3rd. Not because we used excessive amounts, but that there wasn't enough. Overall, I would definitely stay here again! Check-in was a breeze and did not run into any major problems.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The rental was both spacious and clean. The entire complex was kept up and we always felt safe. Your condo is in a perfect location. The beach located across the street was beautiful and not too crowded. It was within walking distance to some of the best eateries in town. The only suggestion we would make is to place an a/c in the bedroom. It was too warm for us to sleep in. With the only a/c being at the front of the condo and the bedroom being in the far back, we felt there was no other option than to both sleep on the fold out from the couch in the living room. We are from Texas where we're used to the heat, but this was too much to be able to sleep comfortably. On the plus side, we found the foldout to be more comfortable than we imagined. That was a nice surprise and helped the non use of the bedroom a little more tolerable. We found the beach towels, iron, blow dryer and such to be extremely helpful. Thank you for thinking of those little touches that made our stay a wonderful one. We hope to be back someday.

We saw lots of turtles there and the snorkeling gear that they provide at the condo helped to see them even closer.   At the 6th floor, you can perfectly see the sunset from the balcony.  My mom was worried that the room would be too hot at night because of reviews saying that the air conditioned didn't cool the room but Maui's wind not only let us sleep well, it made the condo so comfortable that we never opened the air conditioning of our trip.

I actually felt bad, thinking I woke him up. Overall, you will feel right at home in this place.

Terrible coordination, intentional misinformation, and lack of sleep is what you gonna get staying here.\n\nThe place is a typical student den. Disgusting bathroom, stains, hair everywhere, the rug on the floor is permanently soaking wet and smelly, the toilet is often left filthy even though there's a brush right next to it. Selim barely speaks English, so we could only communicate through a translator app. That's all fine though, pretty much expected when traveling on a tight budget, that's not the worst part.\n\nThe worst part is all the random people snooping around, moving in and out without notice, and being loud during the nighttime. Before booking I specifically asked who else lives in the flat, and Selim said there's only him and his girlfriend. The reality is, neither is ever present (I believe we've seen each other 4-5 times during my month long stay), and the rest of the flat appears to be rented out separately (it is, see PS), meaning that you're left dealing with a bunch of strangers on your own.\n\nAdmittedly, most of the visitors were nice and considerate, but the last week I've had the pleasure sharing the flat with four guys, cramped together in the other room, drinking, leaving food rotting in the kitchen for days, using my soap and towels, arguing at 3am, slamming doors, and being completely unresponsive to numerous requests to keep it quiet at night. Selim didn't do anything meaningful to handle the situation. Either he's too shy to keep his guests' act in check, or simply didn't care, since he's almost never around anyway. So I had to resort to talking sense into them myself, which is a pretty awkward thing to do being a guest on someone else's premises, if you think about it.\n\nEventually we ended up installing door locks, so at least now it's possible to go outside and not worry about your stuff being stolen or messed with.\n\nPS: There's another listing circulating in the Similar Places section, 'Comfortable and Nice Room in a Good Location', posted by Erinç, Selim's friend, per his own words. Be careful because it's the same flat, just a different room. In fact I stayed in that one, judging by the photos. Didn't mind it though, it's a better room."},{"_id":"298988441","date":{"$date":"2018-07-30T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"21382912","reviewer_id":"39782399","reviewer_name":"Cyril","comments":"Quiet and useful place, close to subway and restaurant.

From Mui Wu ferries to Hong Kong city (20min bus, 30-50min Ferry ride - some ferries are fast ferries, and to outlying islands like Cheng Chau.  The village is surrounded by bush land with walking paths everywhere, a swimmable beach and if you like exploring waterfall pools.  Old buildings and the occasional shrine with incense helps imagine what this place was like a long time ago - this place exceeded our expectations."},{"_id":"337899206","date":{"$date":"2018-10-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"21406716","reviewer_id":"20351193","reviewer_name":"Jules","comments":"I had a very pleasant stay at Marc's place, the apartment is gorgeous, really easy to access from the Cheung Sha Ha Tsuen bus station, and is literally 200 ft from the beach!\nAll the people in Cheung Sha beach were super friendly and welcoming, there are a few shops and restaurants around and it's a perfect getaway from the intensity of downtown Hong Kong.

You have found the right place and the right person =) everything went excellently well during our stay.  We were a bit worried before our flight since we were so busy at that time that we forgot to confirm with Carlyn our arrival, but hopefully Carlyn and her roomates (Hilary, Hannah, and CJ) have been so kind and helpful that we arrived without any inconvenience!  Carlyn even managed to host my additional friend with only 2 days prior-notice! She is also very responsive and dedicated to ensure your comfort even at her busiest times (since she usually works late, such a hard worker!), so I'll give her two thumbs up for being able to manage everything so well and also all the good attention that she gave us. Note: pls be aware of the tempting dessert/food that you may find in the kitchen! since Carlyn loves to bake and cook, you may probably find (sometimes) a light scent of vainilla cinnamon brown sugar in the house, which we found it completly lovely! Thank you Carlyn for being part of our first fantastic experience in NY! =)"},{"_id":"48410690","date":{"$date":"2015-09-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2141667","reviewer_id":"41863400","reviewer_name":"Nadia","comments":"My sister and I stayed with Carly and her roommates for 2 nights in September to attend a cousins wedding.

We had a great first impression: the apartament was so big, clean and organized and looked exactly as shown in the pictures. Carlyn was not there to receive us, but her (Hidden by Airbnb) welcomed us warmly and explained to us what we needed to know to feel just like home. I must give special thanks to Hannah, who was so dear and gentle, always carrying a smile on her face and prompt to help us at any request. The house has all it takes to make you feel comfortable. The fact that it has two bathrooms made things a lot easier and the kitchen is well equipped, even though we did not use it often. By the way, the bathrooms are so good! The shower was awesome! There is a metro station just at the end of the street, that takes you easily to downton. The location is still good, but don't expect to be in the heart of Manhattan. It takes around 20 minutes in subway to midtown and 30 to 40 to downtown. Our room was big, with enough room for the suitcases and we had a comfy bed. The lack of curtains with a blackout bothered me a bit, since i like to sleep in a complete dark. If you are a night person, or if you have light sleep you may have a bit of a problem, thus you can experience some noise from the outside. The fact that you have to cross the living room to walk to the bathroom is also something that bothered me a bit, because sometimes you don't want to be seen in pijamas or in a towel, or as a sleepwalk in the morning, lol. What i surely can say is that we felt like home and our hosts were awesome! Despite those small details that i mentioned, they were easily overcome by the gentleness of Carlyn and the other hosts. I would definitely stay there again. I left very early, without the chance to say goodbye and to thank you for our pleasant stay in NYC. Please don't think that i was indifferent to all your care toward us and i truly hope that you all get my message and sincere gratitude.

You can have a glimpse of the Hudson river from the bedroom, a luxury in New York city.\r\nRoom: Room is spacious and tastefully decorated. Carlyn had towels and toiletries and even medicine for fever that saved me during our stay. Everything about the room was thoughtful and smartly done. Carolyn has an amazing collection of books and I enjoyed reading one of her books. It will be a unique memory of my stay there.\r\nHouse: The living room is spacious and great to relax at the end of a tiring day in NY. \r\n\r\nWatch out for:\r\nYou need to walk past the living room to go to the shared bathrooms (yes there are two). Although it was slightly uncomfortable for us to begin with, we got used to it.\r\nThere is not enough space to keep your stuff in the bedroom.

Alle voorzieningen WIFI ea waren er, ruime living waar je even kan zitten. Carlyn volgt alles super snel op en denkt mee na. De kamer waar wij sliepen was niet zo groot maar voldoende omdat je toch meer in de stad bent. Kleine details maken het fijn zoals leuke boeken en kleine verzorgingsproducten. Heel goed bed met goeie matras. Directe metro verbinding naar het centrum wel rekenen op een half uur transport tot Times Square. Veilige buurt met toch wat omgevingslawaai zeker zaterdagavond is het salsa feestje gezellig.

They are without a doubt the nicest people you will find on AirBnB. If you're open to it, Carlyn and Dave will treat you like family. And they take making you experience as positive as possible very seriously.\n\nAnd when it comes to the room itself, it is spotless. Everything is very clean, all throughout the bedroom and the apartment. There is an extra bed set and towels, an open closet with hangers, a bookshelf with all sorts of interesting reads and reference materials for your stay in NYC, and most importantly for my stay during the height of summer, a fully functional and powerful air conditioner.\n\nThe bathroom was always clean, and best of all it is right next to the bedroom! Super convenient.\n\nThe living room and kitchen area is super roomy, and if you're so inclined you can even use the kitchen as you see fit. Just remember to clean up after yourself folks! A nice tv with a great selection of streaming services through Amazon, including Netflix!! So many nights spent watching that.\n\nAs for the location, there is just so much to do in the area. There are several parks right within walking distance, including Riverside Park across the street. There are also plenty of restaurants and bars along Broadway, or a short 15 minute walk to Central Harlem. Both City College and Columbia University are decent walk away. But best of all, the 1 subway train is right on the same block as the apartment, which really unlocks easy access to much of Downtown.\n\nAll in all, my stay was a great experience, and I would highly recommend anybody looking to visit NYC to do the same and stay with Carlyn and Dave."},{"_id":"181903129","date":{"$date":"2017-08-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2141667","reviewer_id":"129987392","reviewer_name":"Antonio","comments":"Padrisimo lugar, gran experiencia"},{"_id":"187208066","date":{"$date":"2017-08-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2141667","reviewer_id":"1403125","reviewer_name":"Elizabeth","comments":"Carlyn's place is a great place to stay.

Bed was comfortable for two and the A/C was working. Check-in was easy and we were able to let ourselves in and out throughout our stay. So incredibly close to the 1 subway train! Carlyn was not home when we stayed--only her roommates. Bathroom was very pretty but the shower handle is sensitive and switches between very hot or cold water. If you are a light sleeper, warning: there is constant loud music playing from cars or neighbors on this street. Another negative was that there was no 'parking on premises'. Difficult to find a spot to park near the home and please beware not to park near fire hydrants! We received a parking ticket for being 8 feet away from a fire hydrant in front of the home (supposed to be 10ft away). We are from Oregon and usually those things are painted or a sign is posted. Be sure to bring your measuring tape in case you want to be safe. We highly recommend Carlyn change the amenity status from 'parking on premises' to just 'street parking.'"},{"_id":"192076043","date":{"$date":"2017-09-09T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2141667","reviewer_id":"142303648","reviewer_name":"Fabrício","comments":"Acomodação muito boa!

That’s a bit of an unfortunate reputation because the folk that live around here know just how charming and spectacular the booming area can be. By the water there’s newly developed park land that shows off the Sydney’s incredible sandstone cliffs and high-end dining establishments that feed the city’s power offices (both (Hidden by Airbnb) and Fairfax are in the wharfs). Further inland there’s hip cafes like Clementine’s and Miam and a surprisingly multicultural food scene - try Kopitiam for Malaysian, Vic’s Meats for American barbecue, and Willis Canteen for Indonesian.       Then there’s the big draws, the Fish Markets and the Casino itself – not for gambling though, simply because it contains some of best restaurants in Sydney.","notes":"Late check-out and early check-in is available where possible.

The check in did not go well as we weren't told which apartment it was and the key had to be collected from another location over 1km away which we didn't know either until we got there, and had sent the uber off.  The listing says there is a key safe but they didn't use it for us.  The host wasn't contactable either despite calling the 24 hr number a couple of times and leaving messages, so the whole process took about an hour and a half.  The apartment is tiny and is more of a bedsit rather than having a separate bedroom.

There is no view to speak of but we only slept there so that wasn't such a big deal. Quiet street. Great washer/dryer for use. Good amenities. Beware of the footboard on the bed- it sticks out beyond the mattress and loves to bite your shins. The biggest headache was the check in process; we arrived a bit late and had to check in at a hotel that was kind of far away - especially when dragging our luggage uphill most of the way late at night. Also, do NOT get on the elevator - in our jet lagged state we failed to notice the lettered-wing and got on the elevator only to get stuck for 10 minutes... especially concerning as the emergency button didn't seem to work. You'll be on the first floor; door was open and unlocked when we arrived but for the rest of the visit it was locked when arrived to add to security."},{"_id":"217328699","date":{"$date":"2017-12-08T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"21421463","reviewer_id":"58079911","reviewer_name":"Renee","comments":"Great comfortable little apartment for a business trip.

So privacy has to be managed, but for a couple this is not an issue.\nThe bathroom is new, modern, roomy and has a larger cnr shower.\nEverything was provided from toiletries, towels, milk, bikkies, even spare batteries for the remotes.\nThis property is 1 min walk to Star Casino, 3 mins to a full-sized Coles supermarket, 5 mins to Darling Harbour and 15 mins the the city of Sydney.  This was all walking times, not driving.\nI rented a car from AVIS in the casino and they let me park it for free in the casino for 3 days as well.\nThis is a super apartment for a couple or 2 individuals.  It is very quiet - like dead quiet, but the city noise is heard when the windows and balcony doors are open.  I love that noise, but you hear nothing when they are closed.\nThe pool is large at 30m long, but it is on the opp side of the complex."},{"_id":"347799111","date":{"$date":"2018-11-11T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"21421463","reviewer_id":"46602162","reviewer_name":"Kate","comments":"Great location and cute apartment.

James is a wonderful host, and communications with him is quick and easy.  Kitchen is truly fully equipped, and pools at the complex are great! \nTwo minor downsides are 1. Noise from the complex easily gets in (cars park right outside the bedroom window, and kids run in the hallways)\n2. The front desk staff are very rude and uncooperative because they don't get any profits from owners like James. We asked if we could leave one luggage with them for 1 hour, and they said they will charge us $75, and rambled on for 15 minutes on why they'd have to charge a rediculous amount. This brings me to my 3rd minor downside (I know, I said there were 2, because this is apparently everywhere on Maui, and not necessarily Old Lahaina area where James condo is at: It is not safe to leave any belongings in the car. We saw a car with a shattered window on the street in front of the complex, so leaving your luggage in the car if you arrive earlier than check-in time or leave later than check-out time is not wise."},{"_id":"130717340","date":{"$date":"2017-02-07T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2142754","reviewer_id":"84937802","reviewer_name":"Eric","comments":"James has done a nice job making this a very comfortable unit.

What a prince :)\n\nA few highlights were the two pools and pagodas; comfortable living room; fantastic king bed with excellent linens; washer / dryer; sleepy laid back complex.\n\nCouple of notes if you’re staying:\n\n- Baby Beach is a 15 min walk north! Beautiful, calm waters if you’re there with young kids. Easy to get to with an umbrella stroller!\n\n- Local supermarket is an easy walk for essentials. If you’re there for a week it’s worth the trip to Safeway or Costco en route as their produce and options are better. \n\n- 1 min walk to the bus. You definitely don’t need a car when staying at Jame’s place. The bus loop to Kaanapali is a 1 min walk. $2 and runs every hour (30 min trip). Try the Hula Grill in Kaanapali - the food is fantastic.\n\n- Fab coffee shop 2 min walk from the apartment called Banana Bread and Coffee Co. Great coffee and excellent breakfast sandwiches and wraps. \n\nJame’s place is an exceptional deal and won’t disappoint! Thanks again James :)"}]}
