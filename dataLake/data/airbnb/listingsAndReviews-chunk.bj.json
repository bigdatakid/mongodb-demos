The entire downtown, in fact much of Istanbul is hilly with steep roads.\n\nHe waited for almost two hours after my decided check in to receive me, and he was also accommodating to keep my extra luggage safe with him while I tour the rest of Turkey. These little things matter the most to me. \n\nI wish I'd gotten to spend time with the host and gotten to know him but I know it's not the last I will see of him and his place. \n\nCan't thank Bora enough.

No need for A/C or heaters.  Use Palolo ave from Waialae straight up to house for best view/drive. My 88 year old mom who is very picky approved highly! The roosters are just part of Hawaii and ear plugs were provided but I didn’t use them!

Also a good price.  It is up a valley, right next to a main road.  Jessica and Sarah were great hosts.  They communicated well.  The house was spotless; very clean.  We were left by ourselves, which was nice.  We met Sarah when we first arrived, and she was very nice.  They did lots of little things to make us feel like we were in a real hotel.  The house is pretty spacious - it has 2 bedrooms, 2 private toilets and a nice big shower.  The living room is also nice. There was one issue, my wife could not sleep on the back bed, because it dipped low.  We moved to the front room and slept there."},{"_id":"357824847","date":{"$date":"2018-12-11T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"28339807","reviewer_id":"226429194","reviewer_name":"Vlad","comments":"Great place, clean, and close to beaches.

It indeed is breezy full with Hawaiian aloha air.  It is great for those guests  that need a base in  quiet safe neighborhood area from where your can go into adventures by car and HW 1  is very near. Quiet means quiet so not for those that plan to party or be loud late in the night as quiet time is after 10 pm and sound spreads easily in those plantation type houses on the hill.  It is 20 min drive from the Waikiki and that is what we did not realize when looking at the map so our personal preference next time would be to be closer to the beach so that you can walk to it rather then drive and struggle finding parking.  Jess was available for questions any time and responded very quickly.  Checking in and out went very smoothly."}]}

It was wonderful to have such a short walk to the beach and most of our time was spent here.  The kitchen is extremely well stocked and we really enjoyed being able to use the BBQ and spend time out on the balcony.  The local’s guide was really useful in planning our trip and our communication with the host was fast, easy and reliable.  I highly recommend this apartment and can’t wait to stay again."},{"_id":"359455275","date":{"$date":"2018-12-17T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"28345512","reviewer_id":"224153857","reviewer_name":"Natacha","comments":"Don t hesitate. It s a wonderful place to stay.\nVery good situation in front of the beach, close to supermarkets, restaurants and bus stops.\nThe appartement is spacious, fully equipped, very clean  and quiet.\nYou arrive there, you unpack your bags and you are home.\nIf you have questions, you just give a phone call and Jodie gives you the answer.\nNo private parking but personally I had no problem to find a place for my car in the appartement street .\nMy family and I were there for 4 days. If one day I come back to Sydney, without hesitation I will stay at Lyn’s place.\nNatacha"},{"_id":"367472738","date":{"$date":"2019-01-05T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"28345512","reviewer_id":"113009881","reviewer_name":"Callie","comments":"A bright \u0026 airy apartment with everything you need to have a relaxing beach holiday.

Miranda is a suburb in southern Sydney, located 24 kilometres south of the Sydney central business district. You can look up local information on the internet for  'CRONULLA' + 'Royal National Park' to see some of the excellent Tourist Attractions nearby. The 'Sutherland Shire' is one of the cleanest, safest places to live in Sydney. The area is full of trees and therefore native birds. As this is a residential area, it is less cluttered than the city area. Parks and bushland are in close proximity to Miranda, so when you are back from exploring Sydney, you will be able to relax in peace. Miranda also has a huge shopping centre on The Kingsway. There's a smaller shopping centre with a Superbarn supermarket and various grocery shops located in Gymea right near the train station.

She is a very kind woman who will make you feel comfortable and at peace when staying at her home, giving you a chance to really experience what Australian hospitality is truly like. She was helpful in guiding me towards the shopping center as well as highlighting the bus schedule for me, which definitely came in hand. I can't say enough about her and the willingness of help she gives. Whether it's locating sights to see, helping with jobs, or just making you feel safe and at home while staying with her you cannot go wrong choosing Rhonda when looking for accommodation. The area is pleasant, quite, and beautiful. It's very close to the shops and train station, there is also a bus stop outside the house across the street. Not only is Rhonda a gem but her son is very kind and helpful as well. Honestly if you're going to stay in the Shire of Sydney, Australia and you want to save cash doing so while getting a remarkable aweinspiring experience Rhonda's lovely granny flat is the way to go.

She went the extra mile to ensure I was well looked after and was comfortable with my stay. I had an early departure flight and was up at 4am, but so was Rhonda as there was a power cut in the night in Sydney and she was concerned that my alarm clock may have reset! Very thoughtful.. Her home and the sleep out with great privacy for us guests was nice and spacious, very well maintained, nicely scented and very comfortable. Gymea is a great wee part of Sydney with good vibes, great people and offers a side of Sydney very different if travellers have only encountered the commercialness of the CBD/Darling Harbour etc. This was one of the best Airbnbs I have ever stayed at and will continue to use each time I attend transformative workshops in Gymea - Thanks Rhonda!"},{"_id":"211705805","date":{"$date":"2017-11-13T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2838442","reviewer_id":"142738088","reviewer_name":"Jack","comments":"Highly recommend!

The Holuakoa Gardens  is a wonderful, farm to table restaurant in a lovely outdoor setting.  You will enjoy strolling the different art galleries and shops and if your stay happens to be on the first Friday of the month, don’t miss Holualoa’s  First Friday event when the village comes alive with food booths and music from 5 to 8pm. The drive to Kona town is about 15 minutes. The Airport is a 20 minute drive away. The  closet beach is Magic Sands, about 10 minutes away.","notes":"This home is very open with mostly screens for windows and no locks on the doors .

I have been a Superhost in San Francisco for more than 6 years with more than 500 guests coming to stay with me.  I try to get to know many of my guests as that is one of the main reasons I host.  Our experience with Lulie and John was absolutely amazing as we really got to know them and become friends in such a short period of time.  They are truly wonderful, warm, friendly and open people.  \n\nThe place is a very warm home with two separate bedrooms each with a real bed (no cots or pull outs).  That is a rarity and really nice for stays like ours.  There are no windows only screens but it is higher in the hills above Kona so the temperature in the evenings was nice and cool and great for sleeping.  \n\nThe shared bathroom was huge and it had a great shower.  \n\nI also wanted to point out that I have a pretty severe allergy to cats and the listing mentioned they have two cats but they are outside.  I can attest to seeing the cute cats outside and also can state that I had zero symptoms of allergies during my stay which means they do indeed stay and remain outside and not in the unit.\n\nTheir dogs, Bam Bam and Zorro, are very friendly and welcoming, often running up to your car to greet you as you arrive.  Bam Bam loves to be picked up and my daughter fell in love!\n\nLulie told us about all sorts of great places to visit around the island and perhaps if we all are lucky, she may decide to lead an Airbnb Adventure to some of those places.\n\nAll in all, this is an incredible Airbnb and I can highly recommend it to any independent traveler to the Big Island."},{"_id":"333882748","date":{"$date":"2018-10-07T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"28387985","reviewer_id":"68542211","reviewer_name":"Amber","comments":"This place is super cute!

The coqui frogs serenade through the night and the beds are comfortable.

Close to Kona and all the beaches and coffee farms but in a fun, artsy town just up the \"hill\" with its own amazing restaurant. Hawaiian breezes fill the open air home.

When arriving in the eve we were greeted by their pets who are super friendly and love being cuddled. If you follow Lulies instructions on how to get there it is easy to find, while being a little way off the centre of town. It is a hidden gem and you will be surrounded by scenic views and banana, avocado and citrus trees. The house is beautiful and the interior is cosy, and decorated with love and a lot of taste. You can tell they have put so much love into it. If you love pets, staying there is a must! We loved hanging out with Zorro, Bam Bam and their two cats.\nThey gave us great tips on the best places to eat, hike and go snorkelling.  And sharing the bathroom was never an issue at all. Absolutely recommend and wish we had stayed longer. Mahalo Lulie and John for being such lovely hosts!

The warm wooden planks, the way the soft light hits, the contrasting textures, color (Website hidden by Airbnb) all very cohesive with an authentic energy - oftentimes it's the vibe city shops and restaurants will aim for, but fall short on. The accommodations are very comfortable and cozy - it just feels like home. The peaceful yet highly amusing pets add an air of satisfaction as you enjoy your morning coffee on the porch outside. \n\nThe hosts themselves are very personable, calm, and friendly -- sharing the space felt intuitive. They afford you plenty of privacy while also sharing pockets of companionship. \n\nI'd definitely stay here again, and leave with plenty of inspiration to model my future off of. Thank you, Lulie and John!"}]}

So we reached out to the host, and voila- within one hour we were on our way to the Mango House, where a heated hot-tub was already waiting for us :) The communication with the host was as easy as it gets: they were extremely accommodating, to the point of driving to the property to confirm its cleanliness prior to our arrival (and that is at 9pm on a Friday night!). The house greeted us with calming sounds of the nature, bedroom hammock to relax, and breathtaking views of the stars.

Lovely place all around."},{"_id":"405860003","date":{"$date":"2019-01-27T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"28407128","reviewer_id":"143048730","reviewer_name":"Susan","comments":"We have just thoroughly enjoyed 12 days in the Mango House. It’s a beautiful and comfortable home with a huge lanai, hot tub, sauna, outdoor shower and peek a boo ocean view through the lush foliage. The farm environment was perfect for us although the odd rooster confused a bright moon with dawn on occasion LOL.  We found the location great with short drives to a grocery store, fruit stands, snorkel spots/beaches and excellent restaurants.  Initially it felt like our neighbours were very close (we live on a ranch with a 1 mile access road to give you some perspective)  however we found we had excellent privacy and minimal noise. Listening to the crickets, frogs and the waves on the shores below in the evening and at night was wonderful.  Our hosts were great, very accommodating and anxious to ensure we had everything we needed. We had  fresh fruit on arrival as well as more offerings half way through our trip. There is a great little stash of beach equipment we were free to use including snorkel equipment, chairs, cooler etc available on a first come basis.  The beds were comfortable and linens were great. WiFi was excellent. Kitchen equipment, stove, fridge, dishwasher all great. We made fantastic smoothies everyday.  For us, this was a perfect place to stay. Oh yes, the 2 friendly kitties were an added bonus along with a small supply of free eggs from free range wild chickens laid on the lanai.  Avoid Gypsea Gelato - it’s addictive. You’ll end up scheduling your day trips around making sure you get to the Gelato place before 8.30pm LOL."},{"_id":"406739871","date":{"$date":"2019-01-30T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"28407128","reviewer_id":"49583138","reviewer_name":"Jennifer","comments":"What can we say about The Mango Farm?  This is an amazing property, and the caretakers were so generous and gracious with their time to show us around the farm and get to know this wonderful place.  The location is so convenient for spending time at Manini Beach or the pier.  The house itself is beautiful and appointed with everything you need, or could even want.  We spent many happy hours on the lanai and soaking in the cedar hot tub, enjoying the relaxed vibe of the farm.

Beautiful, spacious spot in South Kona with stunning cedar hot tub enveloped by beautiful jungle-like plants.  Very stylishly decorated with a zen decor and everything was super clean / spotless when we arrived.  For those who like to cook, the kitchen is super equipped with everything you need.  And for those traveling w/ babies like us, not only did they have a pack 'n play, but they also had a pretty baby-proofed spot (e.g. latches in kitchen cabinets)  The owners also leave extensive local tips of things to do both nearby and for day trips -- don't miss Manini beach at sunset and we thought Kua Bay was also worth a day trip for a stunning beach.   The only considerations would be that you have to drive almost everywhere from here since the main road nearby doesn't have sidewalks (true for a lot of the Big Island I think), and as others have noted the birds and roosters are pretty loud so bring ear plugs if you're a light sleeper.   Right now not too many plants are producing, but all the more reason to return soon :)  Overall, a beautiful stay and we hope to be back."},{"_id":"409427750","date":{"$date":"2019-02-07T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"28407128","reviewer_id":"25710616","reviewer_name":"Kristin","comments":"This house was a really special place to stay on the big island.

It’s a unique property - so if you’re looking for a big home that is away from it all, this fits the bill. Our daughter (and us) loved the property cats, the chickens (one of whom laid eggs on our porch), and geckos (yes - they are harmless if you’ve never encountered them.) The hot tub was perfect for the evenings, and we never closed the porch doors because of the breeze. Dawn, Paul and Heather promptly answered all of questions - whether by message or when we saw them in person - and were gracious enough to leave us citrus and bananas. The kitchen is well stocked with dishes, utensils and anything you need to cook. We ate many meals at home, grocery shopping or getting take out in Captain Cook. We would absolutely come back and recommend the property."},{"_id":"415111792","date":{"$date":"2019-02-21T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"28407128","reviewer_id":"82005297","reviewer_name":"Youlee","comments":"A sweet spot in Captain Cook!

There are a couple of other rental properties onsite, but because this is a top-floor unit, it still seems very private. This is in the jungle, so it is inevitable that a couple of critters will make their way in (small geckos and bugs), but we just kept the windows closed after we got there and did not have any issues. The condo is about 15 minutes from the town of Paia and less than 10 from Mamas Fish House and Ho'okipa beach. What was also great is that this place is right at the beginning of the Road to Hana.

As we were there for the holiday season and the first of the New Year, there was miscommunication with the cleaning services. The cleaning/concierge woman was the one that met us, gave us the keys, cleaned the apartment and such. She was late, there were no maps included, the apartment was dirty when we arrived in the afternoon so we had to leave for a few hours to give her time to clean. For the first night we did not have clean towels or bed sheets. There were not enough pillows. The hosts (we never met) and the concierge woman were very nice and tried to make the best out of the situation. I do believe the miscommunications could have been technological or a language barrier (Although I speak Spanish) however the apartment should not have been open for these dates if the holiday prevented an adequate stay.

We loved sitting on the terrace when the sun was shining. Arriving and departing was trouble free and we found the location really convenient for sightseeing and exploring.\r\n\r\nThere were a couple of minor things that bothered us while we were there... The fitted sheets aren't the right size for the beds so they would pop off during the night and we would end up sleeping directly on the scratchy mattress. The kitchen doesn't have bowls so we ended up eating our cereal out of mugs. We booked and paid for 5 people to stay but on arrival the bed wasn't made up for the 5th person and we couldn't find enough bedding to fully make up his bed - he ended up using a couch cushion for a pillow. \r\n\r\nOther than those few points, it suited us well!"},{"_id":"69971801","date":{"$date":"2016-04-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2843976","reviewer_id":"62289143","reviewer_name":"Sabine","comments":"Très bon séjour, l appartement est agréable et maguy est fort sympathique.

Spacious, clean, safe, bright, well-located, aesthetically pleasing, comfortable, new appliances, thoughtful lighting, and quiet.  I was visiting with my wife and our 4 year old daughter (and my 70 year old mother for the first night.  This was our third AirBnB in Spain this trip and it was exactly what we desired.  Eberhard\u0026Aurélie are architects and they certainly brought their professional understanding of space and light to the design of the unit. Everything is thoughtful and the lighting allowed us to create a calm, blissful home base. Great daylight during the day, too. The AC worked very well.  We did not meet Eberhard\u0026Aurélie as they were out of town but we did meet Jamie, their awesome property manager/host who let us in and showed us how the place works. Jamie was fantastic and a huge help; not only did he arrive exactly as planned but he arranged taxis for us to get back to the airport as well.  This place was a great base to visit the Sagrada Familia but also awesome for walking through the Eixample area which is pretty coo; a great 20 minute walk not only passed a subway station but also landed us in the shopping district along Passeig de Gràcia.  The neighbourhood around the apartment is quiet and residential but there are still lots of restaurants and bars nearby.  This place is highly recommended.

Our flight was delayed and Jaime charged us a very absurd price due to the small delay, also there is a very sketchy \"new turist rule\" that he also charged per person as soon as we got in the apartment that ended up being more than 60 euros. Our stay ended up getting extremely pricey and was not worth the money, since Jaime was also very rude as a host. He did an unappropriate comentary to me refering at my profile picture when we were getting to see the apartment.

Not super close to public transit/the center of Barcelona, so there wasn't much to do around there. On a nice day it was a nice walk to the Gothic quarter through Parc de la Ciutadella. Clean apartment with enough for basic cooking. There was a bit of noise from the inner courtyard (smaller room) at night as we had to sleep with the windows open (we didn't test out the A/C, but it was too warm in early November to sleep without the window open). Middle room (with the small pullout couch) is in an awkward place, given the glass-block window facing the shower. Would be pretty awkward to sleep there and have someone else showering (the glass blocks don't block much, to say the least)."},{"_id":"212928703","date":{"$date":"2017-11-19T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2843976","reviewer_id":"1780600","reviewer_name":"Ale \u0026 Laura","comments":"The apartment is very nice and clean and big enough to accomodate us (2 families with 4 adults and 3 babies). \n\nThe area is quite but very well served (including supermarkets within 200 meters from the apartment) and walking distance to the Sagrada Familia. \n\nAbsolutely recommended."},{"_id":"238594962","date":{"$date":"2018-02-26T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2843976","reviewer_id":"99540974","reviewer_name":"Claudio","comments":"Buen departamente reciclado a nuevo cerca del metro , bien ubicado , y maggi nos evacuo todas las dudas"},{"_id":"240179069","date":{"$date":"2018-03-04T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2843976","reviewer_id":"168242642","reviewer_name":"Sam","comments":"My group had a tremendous experience renting out his flat.

What an experience! \nThe check-in was easy and our hosts were flexible when we had trouble getting our bags and ended up being late. You will find everything you need in the kitchen to cook, but bring your own food supplies, as this apartment was spotlessly clean without a speck of food, apart from a little sugar, coffee and oil. There's plenty of shops and restaurants in the area to stock up with so there won't be trouble finding what you need. \nI cannot recommend this place enough.

However the location is aprox 20mins walk from the beach and the apartment is located up a very steep hill. Personally I am fond of hiking so this was fine for me. You can cab it up the hill but you'll have to hail a cab for a quick pickup which can be tough during rush hour. There is also a garage should you want to rent a car while you are there however several Carioca's suggested against due to crazy traffic and regular DUI stops. \r\n\r\nDeborah is very responsive to texts. Deborah manages the listing remotely and has Rosana directly manage the apartment. Rosanna was wonderful and always immediately responds to texts. The apartment truly felt like home and was well maintained. It's perfect for a couple.  \r\n\r\nThe Internet worked very well as well as all the appliances and there is a great big fridge for all your Brahma beer. The door men were always courteous and kept a close eye on everything.

O ar do quarto principal faz um barulho muito alto e não tem condições de ligar. Esperávamos chegar e ter uma casa de casal e um beliche como mas fotos, mas nesse segundo só havia um colchão, e por estarmos em três, tivemos que dormir junto na cama de casal. Por último, no airbnb está descrito que o checkout é até as 20:00 mas fomos comunicados na noite anterior que teríamos que sair até as 12:00. Adiantamos o voo e fomos embora, sem problema.

We camped and loved the special touches with lighting, a private fire pit, and mangos hand picked and given to us from a tree right next to our tent.\n\nAll of the things are needed to make it easy. Jason provided shampoo/conditioner, towels, wifi, and an outdoor shower \u0026 bathroom. \n\nDon't  worry about bringing sleeping bags or your own sheets. That is included. \n\nWe were given great local tips for dining and adventure. Dinner was good and the ocean 2 miles away was beautiful.\n\nKeep in mind, you are camping and it's a nice version of roughing it. You are camping in a mango orchard and  there are a few farm animals on the property (chickens/roosters and goats).\n\n Roosters start announcing the new day long before sunrise.

Out of the city on the west coast which is very nice! Love the outdoor shower-nature at it's finest, and the hosts are very friendly. Bed was very comfortable and the air mattress was pretty great as well. \nCons: 5 miles away from 2 active gun ranges and could hear the gun fire. Not super loud but you can hear it for sure. You are on a farm tons of wildlife and roosters around (if you're sleeping outside in Oahu you won't find a quiet sleep-not a biggie but just a note), the ant problem is huge- I live off grid in BC and don't experience nearly this big of insect issues. We packed all our food away but maybe this issue was from past campers who left the tent doors open? Since there wasn't just one or two, expect to have some small insects around you. \nWhen we arrived there was one camping tent set up on either side of us, (about 30 ft away) with people camping in them. So wasn't nearly as private as we were expecting. These people did leave the next morning. \n\nThanks for hosting!

Jason and Rasika were so helpful and hospitable that it made me as a solo traveler feel so taken care of. The glamping space was so cute and fun and everything I expected it to be. The bed was super comfortable and I greatly enjoyed it.\n\nThe community aspect of the whole property was a nice added touch I didn’t expect. Being able to meet other travelers and find cool ways to connect is something that was so unique. The first night I was here, I came back from having dinner in town and the family made a campfire in a fire pit and invited me to join. We roasted marshmallows, Jason had a guitar out, and it was just a really awesome way to set the tone for my stay. I got to talk to other guests and learn about the hosts. It was so nice!\n\nThe mango I received from Jason ruined mangoes for me forever. Best mango I’ve ever had!\n\nI would absolutely love to come back to Kapila Gardens and spend more time with Jason, Rasika, and their lovely family."},{"_id":"348440831","date":{"$date":"2018-11-13T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"28516771","reviewer_id":"26188980","reviewer_name":"Charles","comments":"We really enjoyed our stay at Kapila Gardens.

The bed was comfortable and the tent was nice! Jason communicated well and gave me great tips on places to explore. \n\nThe part I didn’t quite expect was how noisy the neighborhood was. I was expecting a sort of peaceful farm vibe, but it was more like camping in someone’s big yard. There were loud dog fights (it sounded like) from neighboring properties, music being blasted from neighbors, and the property itself is rough. I wouldn’t call it glamping. Im glad I got to see that part of the island, and glad the bed was nice, but I didn’t want to spend any time there relaxing as I expected I would. \n\nOverall I’d recommend it for a no-frills low-budget place to sleep immersed in a local neighborhood, but not for any kind of super relaxing nature vibes."},{"_id":"355803658","date":{"$date":"2018-12-05T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"28516771","reviewer_id":"68369717","reviewer_name":"Dan","comments":"I have never been a camping type of person but still spent 3 weeks Glamping and think it is an incredible value for the level of comfort.

Location is quiet and in the more chill part of town which suits the laid back Hawaiin lifestyle. We had rented an expensive car for the one day for fun. Jason was able to make sure that it is parked in a safe area.  The tent fits the definition of Glamping for sure - humble and chic. Highly recommended. Although they did provide the mosquito spray, I brought my own mosquito coils just in case. I am more prone to mosquito bites.

Check-out is at 8am (we noticed this last minute, unfortunately). \n\n2. The mango “orchard” isn’t much of an orchard from what we experienced. Though we did get a few mangos upon arrival :)\n\n3. EXTREMELY loud music in the middle of the night (12/29/18) that kept us up. Granted it was Saturday night of New Years week, so that was probably the reason for the loud music. But it was unexpected and did make our experience less enjoyable.\n\nThat all being said....\n\nThis place is pretty cool. You are surrounded by beautiful Hawai’i cliffs in the country, with a very welcoming family there to greet you. The mini-yurt, as we deemed it, was nice and worth the price (arguably). Ultimately, it’s a lot cheaper than most places people stay on the island. As avid travelers/backpackers/campers, this stay was fair comparable to other places. We LOVE how environmentally-friendly Jason’s family is, and their place reflects that (e.g. be prepared to use a compost toilet). Great place, amazing family, few complaints, and a great time."},{"_id":"367005083","date":{"$date":"2019-01-03T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"28516771","reviewer_id":"158868791","reviewer_name":"Kendall","comments":"My husband and I absolutely loved our stay here.

Also quite close to the blue mosque and not too far to walk to Taksin Square and the Grand Bazaar. He answered all of my questions and even responded to an email late because I had lost his address and needed it to get home. Also, he, himself, got up to take me to the airport at 5 am. I head back to Istanbul in 3 days and am hoping to stay with him again."},{"_id":"20938458","date":{"$date":"2014-10-07T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2856208","reviewer_id":"1438113","reviewer_name":"Jeff","comments":"This was my second stay with Metin.

The 'Blue Mosque' is no more than 5 minutes walk, whilst trams (to the metro/Airport connections or to Galata) and the main rail station and ferry routes (for Marmary/crossing to Asia side) are also extremely close. \r\nThe area is served by abundant restaurants and cafe's and we were able to experience the sights and sounds of the historic centre of Old Istanbul at our leisure, without needing to worry about long journeys to and from our accomodation.\r\nThere was a little noise from the cafe outside the appartment, but certainly not enough to trouble us after many full days exploring the City we slept soundly each night!\r\nMy daughter and I would certainly go back and Metin's ayasofya house would be our first choice location!"},{"_id":"59614519","date":{"$date":"2016-01-12T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2856208","reviewer_id":"48430542","reviewer_name":"Helen","comments":"Perfect location and very helpful landlord.

Amazing location, located exactly behind Hagia Sophia and sharing the same wall with Topkapi Palace. It's located in one of a historical and famous street in Sultanahmet called Soğukçeşme (you even can find it in Wikipedia). A very decent and safe neighborhood. 24/7 there will be polices and security guards in the neighborhood, given that it is in the museum, historical and touristic area. We were given the bigger room with no extra charge. You definitely can explore Sultanahmet area (Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, Topkapi Palace, Gulhane Park, Basilica Cistern, etc) simply by walking, even it's closer than the famous hotel you can find in the area. We (me and wife) loved this place so much! We stayed there comfortably. Highly recommended. Metin was a very kind and good host. Communication was quick and simple. He helped us a lot, such as providing and fixing an electricity plug converter, lent us a temporary simcard, and also his nephew who happened to work in the cafe besides the place was really helpful. \n\nPlease note, that Sogukcesme street is only for pedestrian most of the time. I think its only at late night up to early morning, cars are allowed to pass. Also, you need to climb up to the house a little bit through the stairs (from the entrance of the house), which  was just one floor up. So with these, if you have a lot and big luggages, you might want to consider this. We personally had quite big luggages with us, it wasn't that big deal, since it just happened once during the checkin and Haroon (Metin's nephew) and Metin himself helped us carrying the luggages up to our room.\n\nAt night, we did hear some music played from the cafe next to the house like what other reviewers said, but it was not a disturbance to us at all.\n\nOverall, fantastic place and host! We loved it and will definitely be back."},{"_id":"175968716","date":{"$date":"2017-07-30T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2856208","reviewer_id":"86811451","reviewer_name":"Daniel","comments":"Great location!

Marie-Jose responded to all my inquiries very promptly prior to my stay. I loved that they were so flexible and accommodating with the check-in and check-out times as this greatly helped with our travel plans. \n\nTheir place is conveniently located in Lasalle close to the waterfront. The home has a contemporary design yet preserves its historic feel. We didn’t have a chance to enjoy their backyard but it truly looked like an oasis with beautiful flowers and a lush garden. \n\nThe room was spacious and has lots of natural light. It was nice to have the bathroom in the bedroom which truly made it feel like our own private suite. Loved the little touches in the room like the phone chargers. \n\nThe highlight of our stay was hands down Marie-Jose’s breakfast! There were homemade muffins on the table, freshly brewed coffee and a selection of teas, a chia yogurt concoction (amazing!), delicious cheese and apple crepes, and home cultivated honey. My mouth is still watering from the breakfast. \n\nMarie-Jose and Jacques made us feel right at home and part of the family yet we had our space to come and go as we pleased. I honestly can’t wait to book with them again for our next stay in Montreal.

Using the cables on hand I was even \r\nable to plug in the computer to the large TV screen in the living room. I \r\nclosed the blinds and watched hours of soccer over the course of 2 days \r\nwith excellent quality. I know that the WiFi was also able to perform well \r\nfor other tasks even while I was streaming the video.\r\n\r\nIt really rocked to have ATT wireless in and around the house.\r\n\r\nAnother outstanding benefit was the large selection of healing services in \r\nthe area. I was able to select from a long list of massage therapists and \r\nthe provider came to the house for the session I booked. The bodywork was \r\nexcellent and it was so nice to be able to just relax at the house after \r\nthe treatment\r\n\r\nThis is a great place to stay centrally located in a fabulous area. Mary \r\nLove is a wonderfully warm host and happy to share her vast knowledge of \r\nHawaiian culture and history and the many attractions on Hawaii Island.\r\n\r\nI'm definitely looking forward to returning to the area and hopefully there \r\nwill be space available at Hale Puulena.\r\n"},{"_id":"15539686","date":{"$date":"2014-07-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2868441","reviewer_id":"16443240","reviewer_name":"Nate","comments":"Mary Love's home is one of the most relaxing and inviting spaces I've had the privilege to experience. Located in a quiet, cool area, the only surrounding noise is provided by nature. The community in this area is very tight knit, open and welcoming. Every gathering we explored was full of warm people who were full of stories and hospitality.\r\n\r\nThough located in a very rural area, most of the modern conveniences we are accustomed to are available, such as top notch appliances, comfy furniture and internet (if you have time to use it after all the community events).\r\n\r\nThere are so many interesting places nearby to visit that I wish I had booked more time for my trip! This island is quite large in comparison to the others, and I found it very helpful to be staying in an area closer to many of the natural attractions around the island than either of the developed cities.\r\n\r\nThe Big Island is unique in that there is very little light from the ground at night (by street lights and the like), which allows an immersion into activities like stargazing and just being present with the environment around us.\r\n\r\nI will definitely be returning :)\r\n"},{"_id":"16369245","date":{"$date":"2014-07-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2868441","reviewer_id":"17984111","reviewer_name":"Maria","comments":"The only thing lovelier than  Hale Puulena is the heart of our host, Mary Love. She is a kind and generous soul, sincerely interested in our joy and well-being. We felt nourished and peaceful as we relaxed in her tasteful, elegant, comfortable home. The journey to Hale Puulena sets the tone as one travels the mystically beautiful red road, passing rich lava beds, enchanted tree tunnels, hanging jungle vines, extraordinary plant life, and the ocean that beats wildly at the Lower Puna coast line. The Seaview neighborhood, where the home is located, is easily accepting of new visitors, making one feel welcome and at home. There is an instant feeling of tranquility, supported by the sounds of nature, gentle breezes, and the vibrant star filled sky at night. The home itself is recently renovated, sporting all the amenities that one would expect of a luxury property, but at an affordable price. It allowed us to take advantage of the restorative Kalani spa, the warm ponds, magical Wai'opae tide pools, stunning Mackenzie State park, charming farmer's markets, and various other natural wonders and delights. This place is ideal for those that want to get off the beaten track, relax, and take in paradise at a slow and leisurely pace. Get ready to fall in love and return to harmony."},{"_id":"21328696","date":{"$date":"2014-10-14T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2868441","reviewer_id":"5341425","reviewer_name":"Cleo","comments":"Mary is a very friendly and professional host and her lovely place make you think you're comming home.

We felt like that we were touring like the locals instead of tourists.  Marylove provided beach gears and sand toys so we could get the full experience. One thing that is impressive about Marylove is that she is unbelievably responsive. Almost every time I sent her a message, I got her reply right away! Since we stayed at two different houses (the other in Kailua Kona) during this trip and the beds at the other house were not very comfortable, I think it is important to mention that the beds at Marylove's house were very comfortable.

We had a great time in the city with what we wanted to do and found the location of the apartment excellent. Carey was very accomodating and helped us get settled and showed us around her apartment. Her apartment is very tiny but was all we really needed (about the same as a hotel). The bed was comfortable, the AC adequate, bathroom and kitchen facilities were just right. The one drawback was lack of comfortable seating and TV which I didn't realize beforehand. There was a radio which was helpful. The apartment was quiet for the most part except the upstairs neighbor was a little noisy. There is a parking garage on the same street that we used and the worker Luis was helpful in giving us a good rate for two days.  For those who are pet friendly, Carey's cat was there and she was as sweet as can be. She kept us company and never bothered us. We ate at the 44th SW Restaurant for lunch and had a great Caesar salad and excellent pizza. Another restaurant was Westway Diner on 9th Ave. which was good. In the evening we walked to the pier on 12th Ave. which has a restaurant with outside seating and we enjoyed a drink there. The pier has many seating areas and some grassy areas to relax on. It is a nice quiet space when you want to get away from the noise. Overall we had a great trip, got to go to Times Square, Central Park, Carnegie Deli, Juniors Restaurant, and saw the Naked Cowboy. We did it all by walking too!"},{"_id":"2131726","date":{"$date":"2012-08-28T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"287408","reviewer_id":"3173610","reviewer_name":"Cristina","comments":"The reservation was canceled 2 days before arrival.

Carey is so sweet and easy to coordinate with. She made us feel comfortable using Airbnb for the first time :) The place is so charming and homey and was very clean and comfortable. The location could not be any (Website hidden by Airbnb) is very central to everything and the subway is only a few blocks away. It is 2 blocks from Times Square but you do not hear all of the hustle and bustle! You can actually hear the birds chirping in the morning in the courtyard outside the window. It was a very peaceful retreat after a long day of walking and sightseeing. \r\n\r\nThe neighborhood is also wonderful! We felt very safe the whole time. Its located right next to Restaurant \u0026 Theater Row :) We frequented 5 Napkin Burger (corner of 9th and 45th) which was delicious and went to a few different diners for breakfast: Galaxy Diner (9th \u0026 46th), Westway Diner (9th \u0026 44th) \u0026 our favorite; Theater Row Diner (42nd \u0026 Dyer)...all were a great start to the day.  I also frequented Smiler Deli \u0026 Smoothie on the (9th \u0026 45th)...The smoothies are great and they have lots of other groceries you might need. You also have to try the cookies at 'Schmackary's' (9th \u0026 45th). As for entertainment in the neighborhood we tried out 'Don't Tell Mama' Piano Bar which was really fun (46th Btwn 8th \u0026 9th). All of the bartenders are performers and have amazing voices! Swing 46 was great as well...wonderful Jazz bands and swing dancers :)\r\n\r\nOverall our trip was amazing and Carey's studio made it that much nicer to recharge for the next day.

The location is great, around the corner from 9th Ave with all the restaurants and bars and close to Broadway and Central Park. We definitely would come back another time."},{"_id":"21382865","date":{"$date":"2014-10-16T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"287408","reviewer_id":"20268399","reviewer_name":"Lucienne","comments":"Primeira vez que estive em NY e a localização do apartamento nos ajudou muito na locomoção. Muito perto de várias linhas de metro e a 2 ou 3 quadras dos teatros da Broadway e da Times Square. Encontramos diversas opções para comer, desde de fast food a excelentes restaurantes.\r\nA Carey responde muito rápido a todas as perguntas e gentilmente aceitou que deixássemos as malas no apartamento de manhã bem cedo. O local é bem pequeno, mas o espaço é suficiente para um casal que só precisa tomar um banho e descansar depois de um dia inteiro andando por NY.  As janelas estão viradas para um tipo de quintal e não tivemos problemas com o barulho da rua nem dos vizinhos."},{"_id":"21977274","date":{"$date":"2014-10-27T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"287408","reviewer_id":"21888569","reviewer_name":"Liesa","comments":"Carey's studio is really adorable.

Carey's apartment is tidy, cozy and a perfect place to use as a home base to explore this busy area of Manhattan. The apartment is very much Carey's home, and it is charming. \n\nA couple notes:\n\nThis apartment is on a relatively quiet street but it is a very busy part of the city and you will hear some street noise (which is to be expected). \n\nThere is a main subway hub a few blocks away, but it can be very busy as a lot of Times Square/Broadway traffic comes through there. Be prepared for crowds at certain parts of the day, or take one of the many plentiful cabs. \n\n"},{"_id":"30688524","date":{"$date":"2015-04-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"287408","reviewer_id":"14692499","reviewer_name":"Darcie","comments":"Carey's place is just as pictured.

I didn't get to meet Marcos because he was away during our stay but he was very responsive to my messages. His partner was there and was also very helpful to us whenever we needed anything.
