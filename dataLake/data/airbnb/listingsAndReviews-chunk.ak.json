Patrick has a very spacious, nicely decorated apartment, that is in a great neighborhood close to the metro.  The directions on how to arrive to apartment using public transportation was fantastic.  Patrick has a busy work schedule but I was able to enjoy a chat with him and having something to eat together.  Would definitely recommend Patrick as a host to travelers going to Montreal.

Appena arrivati abbiamo subito informato Miguel della scarsa pulizia del bagno e ci ha detto che avrebbe mandato di nuovo la signora delle pulizie anche se non fu necessario. \nLa casa è molto carina ma a mio parere non è adatta per un lungo soggiorno dato che il riscaldamento è elettrico e l' angolo cucina è sacrificato, manca l' essenziale come sale, olio ecc. Nella casa si può trovare detersivo per piatti, spugna, bagnoschiuma, phon, carta da cucina e da bagno (anche se per 4 persone in un soggiorno di 5 giorni ci vorrebbero più di 2 rotoli).\nNel nostro caso erano giorni piovosi e le finestre di legno non sono molto isolanti quindi la casa rimaneva umida. \nIl frigorifero è di quelli piccoli,  non so se si fosse rotto però le cose fresche si sono rovinate. \nDetto questo la casa rimane un buon compromesso perché si trova in una posizione strategica a pochi passi dal centro e supermercati."},{"_id":"274528009","date":{"$date":"2018-06-09T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15384713","reviewer_id":"191379203","reviewer_name":"Gonçalo","comments":"Bom local, confortável apesar de alguns contra-tempos."},{"_id":"280890330","date":{"$date":"2018-06-24T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15384713","reviewer_id":"193731677","reviewer_name":"John","comments":"Great location, nice spot, very nice host.

When we arrived we were told we had been 'upgraded' and were given a different apartment to the one we had booked. The apartment we were given was sadly not yet fully operational / suitable for guest rental. Issues included exposed wiring in a bathroom powerpoint which was a potentially dangerous situation given that the bathroom floor was extremely wet due to inadequate shower drainage.  When this powerpoint was used it shorted the household power. Other issues included water leaking from the kitchen wall, inadequate heating, security issues (apartment could be entered via a hole in the wall and through a locked cupboard door), no hot water in the kitchen. I let Miguel know in detail the issues we encountered, but he was out of town until late in the evening, however he did come by the following morning but was unable to resolve the issues during our stay.  Once these issues are resolved this apartment certainly has the potential to be a great place to stay. It has a lovely ambience, is well furnished and is in a great location."}]}

Pero, por eso, el local donde hay uno de los sofá camas en el sótano, no tiene ventanas y es un poco más frío que las otras habitaciones. Y por eso también, el piso no tiene mucha luz natural (los vidrios de las ventanas no son completamente transparentes lo que es bueno para la privacidad, pero no tan bueno para la iluminación).\nTuvimos un problema con una de las dos duchas pero Francisco estuvo siempre accesible por mensaje y vino cambiar la manguera desde que posible.\nEl barrio del Poble-Sec es perfecto, con mucha vida, bares, restaurantes, se hace todo a pie y tampoco está lejos del casco antiguo.

It accommodated ten people comfortably and was as pictured. \n\nFor some reason Francisco had only made the bed for eight people, there was no hand soap in the 2nd bathroom and he hardly spoke a word of English - which was fine since I could manage in Spanish, but I don't envy those who have no Spanish and will try to work out the check-in details with him over the phone. On that note, Francisco was very insisting - to the point of being rude - that I don't call him again until I'm outside the apartment: 'don't call me on your way, don't call me around the corner, just call me when you're in front of the house.' That would've been fine if he would've been inside waiting, but after I called it took him twenty minutes to come over and open (he said five).\n\nThere were ten of us on our way to an all-night festival so I was surprised that Francisco only had two sets of keys (and only one alarm-disarmer). When I asked if it was possible to have more sets he arrogantly told me it was an impossibility (when of course he can have more keys cut) and that he had rented the place to a group of friends, not ten individuals. While that is true, it still over-complicated things for us and when you're renting such a big place I think an investment in one or two more sets would really please your guests.

Unfortunately there were several issues when we first arrived including cleanliness issues as well as ripped and dirty furniture not represented by the photos shown in the listing.  These were brought up to the host and he responded promptly and had folks out to fix things like a broken bed, missing linens, broken railing, moldy bathroom, missing glass door on the shower, etc within 1-2 days.  We had booked the flat with the description stating that it can fit 10... long story short... it can fit 10, but not comfortably and with 2 keys total, it is very hard to make plans with a larger group.  Additionally, it's important to note that some of the \"rooms\" which sleep 2 each are not rooms so privacy can also be a concern.  1 of the rooms is in the basement which does not have AC to it, so this could also be an issue if the weather is warm.  While we were in town, the weather was warm so we had to run the AC... which we were messaged that it was too loud for the neighbors a few days in to our stay.  Additionally, like other guests have stated, the hot water heater accommodates about 2 showers at a time, so with a group of 10, this makes getting ready for the day very difficult.  We had 1 of our group members leave after the first night due to some cleanliness, privacy and difficulties with the 2 key issues.  Overall, it's in a great location, so if you have a small group or if you don't care about showering or having only 2 keys, it is wonderful!

You came at 10:40 when we were still getting dressed and you tried to get in. you came back at 10:50, you said that we only have 5 minutes and you entered inside while the girls were almost naked. This is called harassement. Until now we stayed polite because we are all well educated and came to Barcelona to enjoy our weekend not to create problems even if your attitude was very rude, you don’t know what is apologizing and what is tourism.\nAt 11:02, you started screaming and threatening us that we won’t have our money back( the change from the taxes + late check in)  because we had 2 minutes delay which is extremely annoying. Until now we didn’t say anything we just got off the house without even checking if we didn’t forget anything because it was 11:02 and you seemed very impatient and agressive toward all of us while we were just asking for our money back( the change from taxes) \nThis being said, let’s come back to how things happened during this weekend:\n1- the communication to retrieve the keys was extremely bad, we spent around 2 hours to succeed to reach you. The person that was supposed to give us the keys didn’t answer our call for one hour and then my friend waited for 30 minutes before she came!!!!! And she didn’t have the change and still we didn’t say anything even if it was cold and dangerous. As we are regular travelers we learned to be indulgent and to be human in our exchanges which is not your case.\n2- The pictures on airbnb don’t look like reality, they are fake as we didn’t have the same furnitures, the house is very dusty and dirty, we even found a cockroach!!!!  The beds are very thin and uncomfortable. And above all, the house is very noisy we hear everything when we are sleeping from outside.\n3- Let’s now talk about the neighborhood, what about these guys who sit in front of your house all the day smoking weed, drinking and talking aggressively to us?? What about these neighbors who threw eggs on us because we were talking from 8:00 pm to 9:00 pm(from 10:00 pm we were at the restaurant, with proof)?? Your house is  insecure. \n4- Even inside the house, it’s dangerous:\n- electrical plugs not covered and my friend got hurt\n- no electricity in one room\n- insects in the ceiling and on the table\n- the entrance door is very fragile and we were very afraid that the guys on the step in front of the door got in because they were knocking at the door.\nUltimately, it seems very enigmatic for us how there were some old good comments as this is the worse Airbnb experience for the 10 of us. We are very disappointed of your agressive attitude and we intend to take the necessary measures to make sure that this bad experience won’t occur for other travelers and to restore justice for all of us."},{"_id":"347920428","date":{"$date":"2018-11-12T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15386249","reviewer_id":"82046438","reviewer_name":"Lucy","comments":"Thank you for allowing us to stay at your home.

Bed is a double which makes it a tight fit with two grown adults but it does the job.\n- The location is definitely A+ and you will be extremely happy. It is walking distance to a plethora of restaurants, shopping as well as misc. stores (Shoppers Drugmart, Convinience, etc).\n- Bixi bikes are within 20 ft of the entrance / exit making it that much more enjoyable to ride a bike throughout Montreal\n- Uber to and from this space is extremely accessible and I didn't spend more than $20 to get from the bnb to the casino, schwartz deli, old montreal, etc.\n- Host provided us with towels, cleaning supplies, soap, etc. for our stay although we did use our own\n- Pictures in the listing are 100% accurate and you won't see any surprises\n- Wifi is also available at this location as well for those who rack up data usage.\n\nOverall, I give this space a 5/5. This was my first airbnb stay as well as first time in Montreal and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Will be booking this space in the future if I do come back to Montreal soon.\n\nTHANK YOU!"},{"_id":"179720495","date":{"$date":"2017-08-08T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15400061","reviewer_id":"96426723","reviewer_name":"Holly","comments":"Excellent location for access to restaurants and metro."},{"_id":"182450127","date":{"$date":"2017-08-14T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15400061","reviewer_id":"39599563","reviewer_name":"Sarah","comments":"Great communication!

The furniture is quite old, worn out, the bed sheets were clean but had holes in them, mattresses were really dirty.. The bathroom looks unclean mainly because it is oldish as well and the worst thing was a very bad smell that we had during the whole stay and couldn't find where it came from.

She offered coffee, toast and jam for breakfasts, although I ended up buying food and making my own--she left me space in the fridge. \r\n\r\nAir conditioning took the edge off the heat; there was a fan in the bedroom and a small stereo as well as TV. I wasn't always comfortable in the Living Room as her bedroom and office were right off it, and she was often there, so I mostly kept to my room. Guests should note that while the room profile shows a washing machine, her notes say she will wash your clothes for 8 euros per load. \r\n\r\nThe location was very good, just a couple blocks from the subway and within extended walking distance of several key sites. I was given keys so I could come and go as I pleased. I appreciated the quietness of the space.

She gave me very useful tips and ideas a couple of time I interacted with her during my stay. The flat/room are exactly as shown in the photos. I tend to be private person, so when I was siesting or having to work, I tended to stay in my room. When she says she will leave you alone, she means it:) She let me have my much-needed space without making me feel weird about it. I really like the location. It is within walking distance to tourist attraction and the tourist busses. Two busses (right in front of her building) take you to the Placa Catalunya (sp), which you can use to A) take the bus to the airport and B) to start your walk down Las Ramblas. Another couple of buses, about two  blocks away, go down Las Ramblas (from which you can turn off to Bari Gothic), one of those two going along the coast of La Barceloneta (sp). The Metro, which is two blocks away, is but 3 stops from La Sagrada Familia. I liked how I could get to everything but wasn't in a neighborhood of tourists (I do think I noticed other airbnb-ers in the barrio though!). The neighborhood was nondescript yet pleasant...

Some of visitors were too tall for the bed but with my 155cm height, I had no problem sleeping on it.  Hot water from shower was abundant. The view of skyscrapers from windows was good. I could even partly see New Years fireworks from windows. \n\nApartment concierges were at a ground floor 24 hours. They open the entrance door when you come home. Some of them can communicate in English. They are all kind and helpful.\n\nCarmen was super kind and communicative host. Her indication was accurate and helpful. She kindly left an octopus card for visitors to charge and use. \n\nThere is a washing machine in a listing but HongKong was too humid to dry laundry fast.  You can use a laundry shop next to the apartment. They wash and clean your laundry in a day.\n\nThe location was only a few minutes from a tram station. \nWalkable distance from Central and Causeway Bay. \n\nThere are many towns in HongKong but I am totally satisfied with staying in Wanchai. \nWanchai has modern skyscrapers, hipster attractions, and daily local markets and small restaurants.  St Francis street looked very sophisticated and I didn’t feel unsafe. In front of the apartment, there are rainbow stairs which looks like an Instagram shooting spot and a lot of foreign people were taking photos. If you are a vegetarian, I strongly recommend a restaurant “天然齋 Green Veggie” 15min from the apartment."}]}

Culture Beyond the glass and steel of Hong Kong’s commercial persona, the city also boasts a vibrant cultural scene that features the eclectic influences of its Chinese roots, colonial connections and a wondrous pool of homegrown talent. Here, you’re just as likely to find yourself applauding at Asia’s top film festival as joining in dawn taichi or reading the couplets of a local poet to the drumbeat of a dragon boat. Culture could also mean indie music under the stars, a classy art walk, your first Cantonese opera – not to mention the exhibitions and events staged year-round at the many museums and concert halls. Why I Love Hong Kong I love Hong Kong because it has a complexity that eludes definition, sometimes even by its own people. I can be soul-searching near the Chinese border, lunching with Sikhs at a Sikh temple, splurging on a set of kitchen kniv","notes":"Please note that not every neighbor is happy about the New Sharing Economy. If we want them to understand the 21st century :-) we should respect normal house rules like: -no party after 10pm -be quiet in the staircase/hallway -don't ring at neighbours bell because you cannot find the key in your handbag -don't throw things out of the window, eg.  Although, the apartment is on a very high standard and equipped like a serviced apartment, I am still a private host but not a hotel with fully employed staff and a front desk. Me and my team are always happy to assist but can take time to follow your not so urgent request (like 1 more towel).  Well, in case that shiny Hotel style entrances and hallways are more important to you than an airbnb Hong Kong LOCAL apartment in a Hong Kong usual residential style apartment - you might want to look elsewhere. There is 24/7 video surveillance and the lifts are operating 24/7.  Just keep in mind it's NOT a new building but the building and environment ","transit":"HOW TO GET TO KOWLOON: By ferry The Kowloon waterfront at Tsim Sha Tsui Riding the Star Ferry from Central or Wan Chai ferry piers is considered a \"must-do\" for any traveller to Hong Kong. Not only is this the cheapest way to traverse the harbour, it's also the finest way to go sight-seeing, particularly at night, where you're surrounded by a wall of lights and skyscrapers on both sides. If you're feeling posh, you can pay fractionally more and travel as an upper-deck passenger. Alternatively, you can travel steerage and maybe get a glimpse into the noisy engine room. By train The Airport Express takes you to Kowloon MTR station in just 20 minutes. Most of Hong Kong's rail lines converge on Kowloon. If you are travelling from Hong Kong island, change at Admirality on the Island Line for the MTR to Tsim Sha Tsui from Hong Kong island. The MTR to Tsim Sha Tsui offers a faster service and is the most popular choice for commuters, so avoid Admiralty interchange during the rush hour (5 PM t","access":"The entire apartment with all amenities is accessible for my guests.

Detergents for washing machine and dish washer are provided for a stay of 3 nights.

The location is wonderful, with lots of great hole-in-the-wall restaurants nearby (which offer some relief from Hong Kong's crazy prices!). If you stay here, be sure to check out Dim Dim Sum and the Biang Biang noodles at Yau Yuen Siu Tsui (a michelin guide restaurant just across the street from the apartment)-- the best noodles I've ever eaten. \n\nThe apartment is small but nicely furnished. Very clean. One thing to note is that the small kitchen has a stovetop and microwave, but no oven. Perfect for cooking a simple breakfast, but not really set up to cook an elaborate meal.\n\nI'd definitely recommend this apartment as a great place to stay in Hong Kong, especially if you're looking for a less touristy location.

We bought Octopus cards for the public transport.\nWe found shops and restaurants around the corner and for products we looked for Tsim Sha Tsui nearby and a few subway stations away Mongkok with its open markets \nand focused shops. Like running shoes, clothes, photo equipments - whatever we looked for we found it. Then there is the Star Ferry or subway to Hongkong island, with shops, ware houses, Victoria Peak,  and a lot more to experience.\nThere are also a number of fine trekking paths on Hongkong island for example. We tried out the Dragon Back which is beautiful and somewhat demanding (if you are 80 like me).\nIn all, I can just highly recommend Jessa Marie's apartment! (And airbnb!)\nAnd get some good walking shoes! Hongkong is worth it. I'd like to come back.\n/Christer Ekman, Sweden"},{"_id":"369011671","date":{"$date":"2019-01-09T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15488401","reviewer_id":"61606505","reviewer_name":"Soratach","comments":"Great place!

The location is excellent, very close to the train station, restaurants, and shops. The apartment itself was exceptionally clean. Wifi worked well, TV had several cable options to choose from,  bathroom was spacious, and there was plenty of hot water for showering. Andreia was easy to reach through the Airbnb app for communication leading up to our stay. If I can make two recommendations for the future, I would suggest making the bed a bit more comfortable, it felt like we were sleeping on a pull-out couch; which is fine for a few nights, but over time this may not be ideal for longer stays. Secondly, while we appreciated having the nice amenity to make coffee in the mornings with the espresso maker, we were only given a few 'pods' to make coffee, so we were not able to use this amenity for the duration of our stay. Other than that, this is a wonderful, convenient, and accessible apartment to stay in, and enjoy the city of Porto!"},{"_id":"349412231","date":{"$date":"2018-11-17T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15498188","reviewer_id":"40397242","reviewer_name":"Natan","comments":"O apartamento é excelente e muito bem localizado!

We are also a month away from giving birth to our second child, so comfort, safety, cleanliness, and familiarity were the most important to us.  Martha and her family made us feel welcome, as if we had been their neighbors for years, and anything we needed (which was very little) was attended to almost instantly.  It was exactly the experience we needed to help us through that very stressful time, and though we are grateful to almost be back to our house, I will honestly say we will miss staying here.  And we hope to run into Martha's family in the neighborhood while we are strolling about.  No doubt if I ever need a place to stay in Park Slope again, I will check this and rebook without hesitation.  In fact I may do it once in a while just to use the luxurious and refreshing shower, which was amazing!  Thank you Martha and family!

There was no way that I was going to stay in a place without a tv! But the icing on the cake was the washer and dryer that Martha also made available to guests. Really over the top, which I so appreciated! Martha's apartment has all of the comforts of home. Park Slope is a safe neighborhood which offers lots of restaurants and shops for visitors, in addition to beautiful Prospect Park, where people of all ages can enjoy being outdoors.

Also the front door has a gate that you can lock while keeping the front door open. However some moths and the ocassional mosquito can get in. There is a screen on the sliding glass door in the back and a privacy shade that you can pull down. \r\n\r\nYou can walk to the Napili bay beach from the condo, about 10 mins, it's better than trying to find parking. There is a weird beeping noise right outside the bathroom window. You can hear it very clearly from the bed at night. This was distracting sometimes as I am a writer so it was hard to focus. I did most of my writing at the coffee shop which as described does have Wi-Fi and is very good. \r\n\r\nThere are two beach towels in the closet and a mini cooler for the beach. The condo unit is small, so there is no living space to hang out. But most of your day you will be out and about or at the beach all day. So you really only need this place for some cooking and sleeping. \r\n\r\nI did not use the TV. I turned it on once and couldn't figure out the cable so I didn't bother with it. The host is very helpful, just text if you need anything. \r\n\r\nThere is a specific parking spot. Use the parking decal provided and stay in that spot. The trash is located at the entrance to the property. I did not check out the pool area as the beach was amazing and took up all my time. Also 5 mins away from Spa Montage. If you get a day pass for $55 you can hang out at the spa all day between the pool, hot tubs, and hydrocircuit.  It was a fun way for me to kill half a day and read in the relaxation lounge. \r\n\r\nFrom Lahaina harbor you can get day trips on a ferry over to lanai or Molokai islands as well. I heard the snorkeling at Kaanapali was a little clearer, but I noticed the currents were much stronger there. I prefer Napili bay. Give the shower pull thing a jiggle if it doesn't make the water go all the way up."},{"_id":"111560865","date":{"$date":"2016-10-31T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15535000","reviewer_id":"69995198","reviewer_name":"Carolyn","comments":"Clean, quiet, comfortable!!!"},{"_id":"121157685","date":{"$date":"2016-12-14T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15535000","reviewer_id":"101255711","reviewer_name":"Ed","comments":"Debra's place is very clean, quiet, comfy, and easy to get were ever you want to go.

Lahaina is a 10 min drive and has all kinds of shops, restaurants, and tours. If you need good quality and well priced snorkeling/dive equipment, I recommend Boss Frog's right next to The Coffee Store in Napili.

The kitchen is nice to look at but is a little dysfunctional for cooking anything more than light meals (but who cooks on vacation in Maui anyway?)

I had booked other accommodation but had a creepy incident that caused me to leave abruptly. I was able to message and confirm booking with Debra all within an hour on a Saturday night which is amazing. THANK YOU DEBRA! \n\nThe apartment was very clean and had good add-ons for going to the beach (cooler, beach towels, snorkel mask). \n\nMy major feedback:\n\n1. The apartment gets hot at night unless you're comfortable sleeping with the sliding door glass open. Coming from my creepy situation, I did not feel comfortable sleeping with it open and there are not other windows in the sleeping/common area. Debra mentions something along these lines in her posting so take that seriously. \n\n2. You can hear your neighbors. One neighbor was up at 5am and it sounded like they were literally on my patio. The other neighbor upstairs had a young baby that I heard crying. The apartment is also under the stairs so you can hear people walking up/down the stairs when it's extra quiet at night. I'll admit that I was a little harder to please than usual -- I was more jumpy to noises since my space had been violated at the other accommodation. Also, you're in Maui. If you're up at 5am it's not the worst thing in the world. \n\n3) I paid $200/night total w/ fees and it felt slightly overpriced. Small things that made me feel that way -- no dish towels (I think?),  a rusty shower head + dingy shower curtain, no place to leave wet things (you're warned that you'll be fined if you leave clutter or beach gear on the patio or walk way) All that said, perspective! We're in Maui and $200 night was some of the cheapest accommodation I could find. It's all relative. \n\nOverall, the place was safe, clean, and convent to driving Route 30 south/north to the other towns beyond Napili. There's a grocery store and some great happy hours nearby. Really grateful I had a roof over my head, a comfy bed to collapse into and a door that locked. Thank you Debra.

We traveled all over Maui and felt this was a great base. Though it’s a 20 min drive at minimum if you want to explore outside of Kapalua/Napili, the drive goes by fast. Coming home to this area and the condo was great. We had no interaction with the host until we had an issue with WiFi, in which she responded within seconds. A sun blind was pulled down on our Lana’i which we assumed was her but was never notified so not sure. Nice people in the area. Great coffee shop and market nearby. Our favorite beach ended up being Kapalua bay which is a 20min walk from the condo. Best snorkeling!

Debra's place is nice and quiet, but is close enough to Napili Plaza for good coffee, food, exercise and groceries.  Or if you're feeling like taking a drive to Lahaina, you have 1st rate shopping and dining experiences.  Debra's place is also just a short walk away from a great beach, Napili Bay, and some amazing snorkeling in Honokeana Cove.  You really can't beat the location of Debra's condo on Maui.  \n\nDebra's place was also clean and well maintained.

I was far enough from major hotels to not feel overwhelmed and so close to amazing beautiful beaches that were inhabited by turtle and fish that always reminded me where I was. The place is very quaint and intimate. Is was really cleans when I arrived and included everything you would need for basic meals. I utilized most amenities in the kitchen. There is a large storage closet that you can store luggage and hang clothes in. She has an iron and ironing board and a few pool noodles stored there as well. There is a grocery store just right down the road and some cool places to eat. I advice renting a car if staying here if not just expect high Uber/Lyft prices but I’m sure that’s anywhere on the island. She stocks you up on the basics that you’ll need, garbage bags, plates, silverware, cooking essentials, etc.  Debra is amazing at communicating and responds so quickly! She also leaves so many resources for not only exploring the studio but exploring the island as well. I would definitely stay here again!"},{"_id":"310710838","date":{"$date":"2018-08-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15535000","reviewer_id":"74699268","reviewer_name":"Cassandra","comments":"Debra’s place was cute and very clean. Cleanliness is my number one and I felt comfortable here. We had a wedding nearby, so the location worked well for us. Unfortunately, there aren’t many sidewalks around (not Debra’s fault!) so walking to beaches and restaurants can be challenging. If you have a car and you’re ok with driving, the location will not be an issue. It’s very close to the resort area, so lots of pretty beaches around. \nThe lockbox was jammed upon check-in, but Debra responded immediately and we were let in. The prompt response was greatly appreciated!\nThe lack of air conditioning didn’t bother me - we kept the windows and screen door open and the breeze felt nice. \nThe apartment complex was quiet and I felt very safe. \nThanks, Debra!"},{"_id":"318906392","date":{"$date":"2018-09-04T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15535000","reviewer_id":"48676010","reviewer_name":"Paula","comments":"I have to start by saying that Debra was a great host. She communicated quickly and was willing to help with issues. Unfortunately her apartment was not right for me and my husband. We found it to be extremely warm and difficult to sleep with the sliding door open since it is merely feet away from the complex walkway. There was a portable fan but it did not work and the overhead fan was not enough.  The apartment is also very bright at night which made sleeping extremely difficult. Overall, I would highly suggest renting from Debra as a host because she was kind and helpful, but this apartment was not right for us."},{"_id":"319975992","date":{"$date":"2018-09-07T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15535000","reviewer_id":"31647829","reviewer_name":"Kalani","comments":"Gorgeous apartment!!

He was flexible about check in and check out and also easy going about me extending my stay. He also left a laundry card for the buildings laundry for me to use, which was a big help and was very generous with his itunes account on the apple tv (there's no tv channels, but there is netflix and itunes) on which i downloaded an awful film!\r\n\r\nThe apartment itself was exactly as it appeared in the photos. Great vintage furniture, interesting plants, comfortable kitchen, nice lamps, lots of lovely bits and pieces. The living room is a little darker than you'd think maybe, especially in the morning when the bedroom gets flooded with light. Good for early risers!\r\n\r\nThe heaters worked well during the cold snap of my stay. They're a little noisy for night time maybe, but they definitely get the place warm when you need them to!  \r\n\r\nTheres a couple of things to get the hang of in the bathroom and I did find that there was some noise from adjoining apartments at various times of the day and night. It was nothing especially outrageous, just dogs and music and coming and going. People living their lives in close proximity, but it seemed worthy of mention here. I guess its part of the exciting location which is great both for exploring Williamsburg itself and getting into manhattan. \r\n\r\nAll in all I really enjoyed my first time staying in Williamsburg and found Paul to be an excellent host. \r\n\r\n"},{"_id":"153066095","date":{"$date":"2017-05-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15550900","reviewer_id":"5054123","reviewer_name":"Caro","comments":"Paul's apartment looks exactly as the photos.

It looked much nicer in the inside than out. Probably the best condo there. It's small but big enough for two people. Clean and provided towels/toiletries/blankets. I let my buddy have the bed and I slept in on the couch. My only complaint is that there was someone that stayed a couple nights before we did, the extra comforter wasn't cleaned. It smelled like the last person who used it. However I'm sure sheets on the bed were clean.

I can walk to the famous cookie company: Big Island Candies about 7~8minutes. This villa must be so famous when built, appearance's maintenance is not perfect right now.

It is in the Waiakea Villas. The building exterior was a bit rough looking and the sound insulation was poor. Some of the tenants/guests acted in ways that made us uncomfortable. We didn't have anything bad happen to us, but as a Waiakea Villas tenant wrote in her review of the complex in 2016 on TripAdvisor, \"It wouldn't be a bad idea to be a little careful around here.\""},{"_id":"182095639","date":{"$date":"2017-08-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15567275","reviewer_id":"138062165","reviewer_name":"Roger","comments":"Perfect place for the weekend"},{"_id":"185105955","date":{"$date":"2017-08-20T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15567275","reviewer_id":"91136655","reviewer_name":"Shari Ann","comments":"Comfy, cozy and quaint"},{"_id":"188246844","date":{"$date":"2017-08-28T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15567275","reviewer_id":"98739139","reviewer_name":"Belinda","comments":"This was a very clean and organised unit.

The location of the unit within the complex meant we had a great view of the pool and it was a nice relaxing place to sit and enjoy dinner and a drink. We were not able to walk to local places from this unit (shops and restaurants), but we had a car so it was not a problem to drive to wherever we needed to go.

It is one room with a kitchen in the one corner and bed and couch on the other side. The kitchen is fully equipped with enough pots, pans, glasses, spices, teas etc. Convenient if you want to cook for yourself. There is a separate laundry room down the hallway where you can wash your laundry and dry it for $2 each (meaning a wash and a dry will cost $4). Enough washing liquid were left for our use during our stay. The bathroom is around the corner equipped with a shower in the bath, toilet and basin. Enough toilet paper for nearly our whole stay were left for us as well as shampoo etc. Before the bathroom is a small wardrobe where we could unpack some of our clothes. Conveniently an umbrella was also left in the condo, as we were unfortunate with the weather. Wifi was excellent and we could work on our cloud server without any hick-ups. \n\nThe location is good, we love to walk so it was no problem for us to walk into the centre of town to the restaurants etc. Although I do think it might be too far for some people or if you travel with small children. There were also 3 restaurants a little bit closer where we enjoyed good food. More than enough parking space outside the condo. \n\nThe only negative which happens to be a big negative for us. The upstairs neighbour and her grown up sons. We were staying for 10 nights and without an exception we were woken up each morning around 5:30am by their loud walking. After that they switched on the television, sometimes so loud we struggled to have a conversation on the balcony with each other. Not to mention them swearing, coughing, smoking weed and spitting over the balcony in our view. It really spoiled our stay. This normally continued until noon after which it quieted down. Perhaps if we have stayed a shorter period it wouldn't have affected us that much, but this was our dream holiday and last thing we needed on a daily basis.\n\nOur booking was 90% based on the good reviews and some people did mention the noisy neighbours. Perhaps we just really had it unlucky, I don't know. In all honestly the owner did offer (after our stay) to refund some of the money. Unfortunately nothing can give us the time back we have lost or change our memories of our stay. \n\nI will recommend this condo for shorter stays to explore the Hilo area and volcanoes. After that move on and stay in different places around the island to make the most of your stay."},{"_id":"242417080","date":{"$date":"2018-03-11T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15567275","reviewer_id":"51204906","reviewer_name":"Nicholas","comments":"A really lovely apartment with friendly and helpful hosts.

The condo is in a good location, close to the airport and downtown. Area is nice, no safety/security issues. The condo bathroom was not the cleanest but the rest of the unit was very clean. The condo is on the second floor of a three-floor building that is made out of wood and is probably 20-30 years old. To say that this building is loud is an understatement. Read the other reviews here and you'll notice a theme that it can be very loud, particularly the upstairs neighbour. We were optimistic and positive when we got there, but it was the loudest condo we've ever rented. The upstairs neighbour was up at 5:30am on Sunday morning rearranging furniture and generally was extremely loud, although we weren't sure if the noise was the neighbour specifically or just the building's wooden construction and age. \n\nThe television is pretty much worthless. No cable, no dvd's but if you bring your own there is a dvd player. The apple tv did not work when we were there and we called the owner (Jeffrey) four times over our two day stay with no response from him. In all fairness, we did not leave voicemail messages, but we did call multiple times over a 2-day period. The air conditioner was ridiculously underpowered and if you arrive on a warm day or in the summer it could be an issue. We got there at 7pm on an unusually warm/humid September day and the air conditioner is so small and underpowered that it took 6 hours to cool the unit down enough to sleep. Overall, I would say that the biggest disappointments were the completely unresponsive owner and the extent of the noise from the upstairs neighbour at late/early hours of the day. You get what you pay for, and we will definitely not be staying here again."},{"_id":"332646521","date":{"$date":"2018-10-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15567275","reviewer_id":"21431564","reviewer_name":"Jeanette","comments":"Nice studio!

The outside lanai is spacious and has a couch, coffee table and dining table, which we used rather than the indoor foldout table.

Downtown is like 5 min drive away and most trails are like 15 min car ride away. This studio has the full kitchen with refrigerator and stove. It came equipped with cooking utensils and knives. My complaint is that the knives are not sharp at all. The scissor was the best knife. I was here for a week and there wasn’t enough toilet paper in stock. This place is small and better suited for a single person or a couple who don’t mind noises. I understand that this is an apartment complex and it is inevitable that you will hear your neighbors since you share walls. However, The upstairs has a large dog that you can hear running around and loud neighbors who were arguing at 6am when I was trying to sleep. They are so loud and it’s non stop. The noise is at all hours and they make the walls shake so the picture frames move side ways. I contacted the host about it and he said it was a known issue and he would contact someone. Unfortunately, The noise only stopped for a few hours... also, the shower pressure sucks. If the upstairs neighbor didn’t wake me up so early everyday than I think I would enjoy my vacation/stay more."},{"_id":"401202861","date":{"$date":"2019-01-13T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15567275","reviewer_id":"110286509","reviewer_name":"Yahshua","comments":"Very responsive and very friendly"},{"_id":"401745931","date":{"$date":"2019-01-15T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15567275","reviewer_id":"142827123","reviewer_name":"Shasta Alpenglow","comments":"This is a residential complex and very loud at times.

The condo was a good size with large, well equipped kitchen.  The kitchen had a good set of utensils and even a nice selection of food items.  The apartment was clean, well organized, and nicely decorated.  The bathroom was clean and also well stocked with towels and other items.  The living room area had a nice sofa, and on the deck was a comfortable love-seat and dining table.  We really liked the location and surroundings of this airbnb.  For example, we were happily awaken by bull frogs and birds in the morning \u0026 surprised to see friendly chicken \u0026 ducks around lagoon. The location of this airbnb is very convenient.  There are so many nice restaurants nearby ( we had a rental car) \u0026 a couple of great lunch takeout lined with locals. We walked around several nice state parks \u0026 local beaches just within 20min drive. We also enjoyed volcanic NP about an hour drive.  We felt safe in the area, and the people in the apartment complex were friendly.  For example, a neighbor was nice to make the change for us when we needed it to do laundry.  The only negative we experienced is that the  neighbor in the upstairs apartment were noisy.  Between 6  and 8 am, and again in the evening the neighbors made a lot of noise furiously stomping back and forth.  There also appeared to be a big dog that stomped around all day.   These negatives  were far outweighed by its positives.  In summary,  we had a great time stay at this apt as  different environment."},{"_id":"404365506","date":{"$date":"2019-01-23T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15567275","reviewer_id":"49799363","reviewer_name":"Cortney","comments":"Jeffrey’s place is near everything.

We had one issue when we were in the room and a host accidentally opened the door without notice as he was about to check in another couple into our room by mistake (he apologised profusely after).

The neighbour kept leaf blowing which made the pool dirty but without me even asking the entire household went to so much effort to clean it before my guests arrived for the event despite having a broken cleaner! It was so sweet. The only thing that was a little tricky is that I didn't realise the private space did not have a kitchen, and the door kept falling off it's hinges. Luckily Sarah let me do my cooking in her family space so all was well. An amazing happy go-lucky host who deserves more appreciation! thank you so much! I hope to stay again :)"},{"_id":"203327042","date":{"$date":"2017-10-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15650737","reviewer_id":"92246744","reviewer_name":"Kurtis","comments":"Stunning place with a fantastic location, very friendly hosts and extremely well maintained house"},{"_id":"203887658","date":{"$date":"2017-10-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15650737","reviewer_id":"20005497","reviewer_name":"Susan","comments":"Sarah was a very thoughtful and friendly host.

L'appart était mieux que sur les photos.

Il y a un four, du lave-vaisselle, une laveuse, sécheuse (qui sont simples à faire fonctionner) et c'était assez grand. Il y a des rideaux métalliques qui se descendent avec un interrupteur et qui coupent complètement le soleil le matin. Un petit lit de bébé nous y attendait aussi pour notre bébé de 6 mois. C'était très bien décoré. Par contre, si vous avez de jeunes enfants qui aiment toucher à tout, faire bien attention à ranger les décorations pour éviter qu'ils ne les cassent! Il y a un stationnement privé pour l'appart en arrière. On est à côté d'un petit café qui fait des lattés incroyables pour 1 euro, sur le chemin du métro. Aussi, on est à 4 minutes à pied de l'épicerie (Pingo Doce).

Apartments is big and clean.\n2. It is conveniently located, close to the Metro station an to the city center.\n3. There is big, comfortable car parking on premises.\n4. Sonia was very responsible when we had a small issue with the bathroom sinks. The issue was resolved very quickly.\n5. Our flight from Porto was later in the evening and Sonia was very nice to let us check out of the apartment an hour later.\n\nThe checking-in issue:\nWe called Sonia a day before our arrival to Porto to let her know that we will be coming to the appointment late in the evening the next day and to get instructions on how to check-in.\nSonia asked us to call her 30 minutes before our arrival.\nThe next day we were driving from Lisbon to Porto. We called Sonia about 5 times between the hours of 7 and 10 pm and did get any response.\nWe checked an email in 7pm and found an email from Sonia sent from Airbnb at 18:34 where she was asking us to come to her house to pick up the apartment's keys. We sent her SMS, that we will do that and asked for her house's address. After that we did not get any response from Sonia until we actually arrived to the apartment at 10:15 pm. At that time Sonia called us and sent the address of her house.\nIt took us additional 1.5 hour to go there, meet Sonia, get all the instructions, drive back and finally get into the apartment.\nThis was rather unpleasant experience after 4 hours drive from Lisbon.\nOne more, hopfuly, temporary problem. Some distant neighbour started consruction at 9am both morning and woke me up. Earplugs were solution for it.\nStill, overall, our stay in Sonia's apartment was pretty good and we enjoyed our time in Porto."},{"_id":"342026408","date":{"$date":"2018-10-28T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15653247","reviewer_id":"16642935","reviewer_name":"Roxanne","comments":"Well located apartment that is stylish, sparkling clean, and new.

Two messages the day of check-in were unanswered, finally we phoned and were told we would be met at 4 p.m.  No-one came, so phoned again, and were told there in 5 minutes. Still no-one came but then an assistant called to say there in 5 minutes. It was much longer than that. We wound up waiting outside the door for almost an hour unable to go anywhere because we were supposedly going to be met right away. \nThe second problem was when we were finally in it was obvious the place hadn't been cleaned since the last guests. Used towels were on the bathroom floor and beds had not been made; the cleaners arrived relatively quickly but this was still inconvenient.\nOn top of that were a number of smaller annoyances that added up. The assistant told us the heating radiators worked but they didn't. There were air conditioning units that we could use for heat but not in all rooms and they were hard to operate and to have even heat. The standing lamp shown in the living room photo in the ad was without a bulb and its broken cord was wrapped around it. The filter coffee maker was missing a carafe and the pods supplied didn't fit the other coffee maker which required a particular brand. There was not enough toilet paper supplied for four guests for three nights. The toilet paper and coffee pod issue was finally resolved just before the third night. The host also provided a few goodies at that time to try to make up for the issues. She assured us this didn't usually happen but we hope in future she will be more consistent with devoting attention to preparing the apartment for guests."},{"_id":"356866167","date":{"$date":"2018-12-09T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15653247","reviewer_id":"224193362","reviewer_name":"Hugo","comments":"Todo muy bien y veraz"},{"_id":"363279128","date":{"$date":"2018-12-28T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15653247","reviewer_id":"667230","reviewer_name":"Ines","comments":"O apartamento é bem localizado, tem uma boa divisão de espaços, todos os equipamentos necessários, além de ser muito bem decorado.

The Master Bedroom is huge and lovely.  The gas fireplace was my favorite feature as I had thought I preferred wood-burning fireplaces...that is until Hale Ohia converted me to the ease and instant warmth of the gas fireplace!  We spent all three days exploring the Volcano National Park, discovered a charming restaurant in Volcano Village called Ohelo Cafe (5 stars on (Hidden by Airbnb) ), the fun Thai Food Truck at the Cooper Center and more!  The cleanliness of this house was outstanding and had all the creature comforts you can dream of.  Every morning we awoke to the sounds of native birds chirping and enjoyed the cool, brisk morning air during our morning walks.  I could go on and on and on...I loved this place that much!

Our family (5 grown up) loves the backyard, very tranquil.  We were from Florida and spent 7 nights at Honolulu before flying to Hilo.  We spent two nights and extended a late checkout for the third day as we took the red-eye home.   We were so glad we paid a little more for the extension, as we can relax our last day of vacation and had a bite before heading to the airport.  The house is very clean, comfortable beds and well equipped, provided everything like a hotel plus more.  They even provided beach mats and cooler, barbecue grill and coal.  Coffee and tea are also available.  The full size washer and dryer is a bonus so we even can have clean laundry going home.  The owner Jeff is very responsive, every time I asked a questions, I pretty much got an answer within minutes.  Not sure how he did it as we have 6 hours different in our time zone.

The living room was very cozy with the fireplace there to warm up as it does cool down a little bit in the evenings. The house was a bit chilly so if you get cold easily you might want to bundle up and put an extra blanket on. (And there were extra blankets!)\n\nThe kitchen was incredibly well-equipped. We even brought things that we didn’t really need such as oil and salt and pepper and some basics for cooking. There were  even extra water bottles that we were able to borrow when we went hiking in the park. Everything was thought of. Definitely the perfect place to stay for those people who are spending time in the park and (Website hidden by Airbnb) was perfect for the kids and ourselves. \n\nThe only drawback is that in Volcano Village there really isn’t much around. You need to make sure that you have purchased groceries before you arrive. We did our shopping in Kona and in a small town on our way to Volcano. If you are coming from Hilo you will want to do your groceries there before you get to Volcano.\n\nI highly recommend this place.

The accommodation in the city of Porto is subject to the payment of a Municipal Tourist Tax of € 2 per night / per person up to a maximum of 7 consecutive nights (from the age of 13 inclusive).

The room is same as it is shown on the photos.Alexandre is a lovely host and to start with he picked me up from the airport even though my flight was very delayed and arrived close to midnight. He even gave me local currency for immediate use till I could change my US dollars. He was always available on a mobile call and attended all the issues like shopping requirements. He also gave a lovely trip to the tijuca national forest in his car. He is like a loyal local guardian and extremely reliable. Though the location is close to all the party zone still you do not get any disturbance while in the apartment.  It is on the 10th floor.

El punto débil también es la ubicación: calle con tráfico, con bares y restaurantes (aunque con las ventanas cerradas no se oye mucho).\nLa atención de Lara y Antonio genial, siempre atentos y tratando de solventar cualquier incidencia. El wifi no funcionaba muy bien al principio, pero cambiaron la instalación y ahora va súper bien. A los 15 días enviaron a una persona para cambiar sábanas, toallas y limpió un poco todo el apartamento. Esto en otros sitios no lo hacen, así que es de agradecer mucho.\nEl piso es lo que se ve en las fotos, un espacio suficiente para vivir: sofá, cama, cocina, baño. La cama es cómoda, el sofá también, la cocina tiene un poco de todo. La ducha es verdad que es muy pequeña, pero no hay espacio para una ducha más grande; quizás se podría poner una mampara de vidrio en vez de una cortina que se pega al cuerpo."},{"_id":"212265596","date":{"$date":"2017-11-17T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15744249","reviewer_id":"93552342","reviewer_name":"Jeremy","comments":"Loved staying here, amazing place in an amazing location!

With a car the apartment is about 10-15 mins away from town and it is also convenient to head to other tourist attractions. There's also a train station nearby if i'm not wrong. Mohit was really responsive to queries during the stay and they managed to arrange for a slightly earlier check-in as our flight was early. They met us for the check-in and explained everything about the apartment which was good. It was unfortunate that we met with bad weather during our trip but the apartment was great overall!

Although they couldn't find the password for the wifi but it didn't bother them because they were out most the time anyway. I could've contacted him and asked him about the password but I was so busy myself with my other relatives so I am very happy that my relatives were happy too. The location was very ideal for people who want to go sightseeing around the city area or to go to train station and bus stop. It's very closed to The Grounds of Alexandria where my daughter's wedding reception was. I can highly recommend their apartment and him and Priya who were very professional, friendly and approachable.\n\nMohit and Priya, thank you very much for being amazing hosts and kindness and everything.\n\nI can only say nice things about the apartment and the hosts.

Firstly, the security and private car park were unexpected and very reassuring. The apartment was spotlessly clean, spacious, comfortable and modern, and included a lot of personal touches. The beds were great and the couches are actually large enough to really relax in. The facilities are brilliant - laundry in the apartment, IGA downstairs, Coles Express and chemist across the road, and Dan Murphy's down the block. We were amazed at how quiet the apartment was considering its location, which was so important to us. It's close to the airport but there was no aircraft or traffic noise.

The playground is perfect for young children with plenty of shaded areas \u0026 in easy access of local take always for meals in the park (we had pizza \u0026 fish \u0026 chips most evenings in the park with the kids).\nAccessing the city is easy with buses directly to Bondi junction then train to city.\nIf you are thinking of visiting hectic Sydney as a family - Catherine’s home makes it a relaxing, thoroughly enjoyable experience.\nThank you again.

We'd have to fiddle with the knobs to get hot water for a minute or so, then fiddle with the knobs again.  This was the only negative part about our stay.\n\nThe location was quiet from other people and cars.  It was accurately described.  We had water, electric, a mini fridge, and a cooking plate if we needed it.  There was just enough space for what we needed.  We did not use the wifi so unsure how it was.\n\nWe also arrived later and during a rain storm so it was hard to see where we were going and Erik came right away to get us with no hassle.  \n\nDo not leave any food outside of the fridge though or you will get ants!  We realized that the first day and once we made sure to not leave anything out it was no issue at all.  No wrappers, candy, or food could be left out.  \n\nThis was a bargain for what we were looking for.  If you do not require all of the usual comforts of a hotel room, definitely give these guys a shot.  We did not get to spend any time talking to Erik as we were gone and busy.  What we learned during our tour was he was a friendly really mellow guy =)\n\nWe would definitely stay here again and will probably do so in the future.

Full size refrigerator to stock up on food (but no microwave, and the portable stove seemed really unused and unkempt).

The nearby town of Haleiwa has plenty of local food options.

Everyday we awoke to birds chirping and beautiful views of mountains. Refrigerator, hot plate for cooking, a pot and small frying pan with some utensils for cooking and eating, sink, a decently comfy bed with clean linens, small coffee pot, outdoor shower which was super refreshing with great pressure and plenty of hot water, small table inside plus outside patio set and a picnic table for eating and relaxing. No AC but we found that the fan and open windows were plenty to keep cool during the nights ( stayed end of Sept) Beach access is not far from the farm nor are great hiking trails and town for shopping and eating. Erik gave us a farm tour along with some fresh fruits and avocado which were amazing. Make sure to stop into their bakery for wonderful sandwiches, smoothies and cookies also that they use their farm produce to make. If you like peacefulness and don't require high end amenities I highly recommend Erik's farm fresh bungalow. We would defiantly return for a stay!!!!"},{"_id":"331484839","date":{"$date":"2018-10-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15748933","reviewer_id":"152169119","reviewer_name":"Juan","comments":"Excellent location."},{"_id":"337307336","date":{"$date":"2018-10-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15748933","reviewer_id":"35185299","reviewer_name":"Charlotte","comments":"Great little place to stay.

Al llegar se nos cobró el impuesto turístico en efectivo, algo que no estaba reflejado en el anuncio y que asumimos incluido en el precio.\nEl piso estaba muy limpio y bien localizado, pero fue una lástima que no contara con jabón de manos, gel de ducha, jabón para fregar o detergente para el lavavajillas. Me hubiera gustado dejarlo tan limpio como lo encontré.\nEl agua caliente funciona muy bien y la ducha es muy cómoda. \nEl piso en sí está bastante bien, aunque es más pequeño de lo que parece en las fotos. Además, las fotos 5 y 7 son de la misma habitación con las camas individuales juntas. No hay cama doble, sí sofá cama (bastante cómodo, como las 4 camas individuales). Las habitaciones cuentan con radiador, que funciona perfectamente.\nEchamos en falta horno y tijeras en la cocina y tener más de un rollo de papel higiénico para 5 personas en las 2 noches que estuvimos. La vitrocerámica y el extractor funcinaron muy bien y había suficiente vajilla como para no necesitar fregar.\nFinalmente, es un piso en el que se oye todo. Una vecina se quejó del ruido cuando solo teníamos encendida la tele a un volumen bastante normal. La tele, por cierto, tiene conexión HDMI.\nEn resumen, el piso está bien pero fallaron los detalles."},{"_id":"141068703","date":{"$date":"2017-04-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15762813","reviewer_id":"119379730","reviewer_name":"Gregory","comments":"Super week-end appart nickel emplacement parfait c'est vraiment du sérieux"},{"_id":"143514323","date":{"$date":"2017-04-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15762813","reviewer_id":"40794656","reviewer_name":"Benoit","comments":"Très bon accueil d'Albert qui nous a aidé à nous repérer dans la ville et à gardé nos bagages les jours d'arrivée et de depart pour que nous profitions pleinement de notre séjour à Barcelone!\nL'appartement est idéalement situé à proximité de la Sagrada familia et des transports en commun (métro, bus...); on y trouve une petite supérette ouverte jusque plus de 00h tous les jours, sans oublier les autres commerçants dans le quartier.

From the very beginning, communication was always very quick and she gave clear instructions for check in – it is only a single bus ride and then a short walk to arrive from the airport. Before I arrived, I asked her about a sim card and she helped me buy one locally for much cheaper than the data cards you find at the airport for travellers. She showed me how to use the stuff around the house and also provided me with a bottle of water when I arrived. We had great conversations when we were around at the same time, she invited me to join her in some excursions since I said I didn't really have an itinerary in mind, and lent me an old phone to use for two days when mine unfortunately needed a repair. The location of the place is very convenient; it is within walking distance of the MTRs and lots of good food just out the door, and there are also very nice security guards in the lobby who helped me with my luggage and greeted me every time I came in and out. The apartment is a bit small, as is the norm for apartments in HK, but the room has more than sufficient space for 1-2 people, depending on how much luggage you have. My only note is that the place could have been cleaner overall, but I personally was not bothered during my stay."},{"_id":"236976575","date":{"$date":"2018-02-21T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15771501","reviewer_id":"129557437","reviewer_name":"Lily","comments":"The host canceled this reservation 9 days before arrival.

On arrival I spent a substantial amount of time cleaning so we could feel a bit more comfortable. A few items just need to be replaced. Mike is aware that his place isn't currently up to par and we found it frustrating that he rented it to us knowing its condition. The neighbors are quite noisy. Additionally there was construction next door, and Mike also had three loads of soil dumped in the back yard during our stay. Communication was lacking.

I love Haiku. This place is walking distance to the best restaurants on the island. Maui Kombucha, The Greek Oven and Nuka can't be missed as well as yoga and fitness studios, massage, chiropractic, mountain biking rentals and shops. It's also a great location to get to all the less touristy and beautiful parts of the island. If I came back, this is the area I'd stay in again. Getting to the house is easy and check in was simple. The place itself is simple and small, but comfy enough for a family of 3 or 4. Loved the gas stove and great water pressure in the shower. Also great to have a washer and dryer to use on our longer stay. Also we didn't need it, but there is a baby crib there. It's also pretty quiet for an in-town location. As long as your neighbors in the hale next door are quiet, you should be fine. Ours were. \n\nThe Cons and Neutrals -  The beds were hard and springy, making it difficult to sleep, especially with someone else in the bed. If you crash easy, this may not bother you. The place is a bit dusty, something that could be fixed immeditaly with a more comprehensive cleaning. We tend to cook in a lot with a kiddo, so the kitchen tools were lacking for us. The knives were too dull to use and the cookware was mostly scratched up teflon. We bought a good knife and cast iron pan at Target to use while we were there that fixed the problem for us and just paid to ship them home. There was only one beach towel (we left one, so now two) and no beach toys for kids, but you can buy some for cheap at the store. There is a cooler and two beach chairs at the house. \n\nFor me, this would be a five star stay with better beds, new kitchen supplies and a good thorough cleaning."},{"_id":"229308149","date":{"$date":"2018-01-22T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15787147","reviewer_id":"163224522","reviewer_name":"Dustin","comments":"too much or too litttle"},{"_id":"232879288","date":{"$date":"2018-02-06T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15787147","reviewer_id":"52594844","reviewer_name":"Maggie","comments":"After staying an a camper for five days in Paia, a tent for four days in Hana, this place was heaven for the final leg of our trip!

Paia , Mamas fishhouse, and beaches and the famous Hookipa lookout with turtles on the beach just 5-10 min drive away.\nWe really enjoyed our stay here. Everything was closeby - Hana,  you can drive to the airport in 20 mins, south of the island 40 mins and west of the island to Lahaina about an hour. The volcano national park is about 30 mins drive away."},{"_id":"240471856","date":{"$date":"2018-03-04T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15787147","reviewer_id":"32876940","reviewer_name":"Karley","comments":"Mike's place was amazing!

There is no air conditioning, but sufficient fans (ceiling and oscillating) to be very comfortable. There is a market and restaurant/food trucks across the street. The prices at the market are VERY high, suggest traveling approx 25 minutes to Kahului and hitting Target or Wal-Mart for groceries/necessities (as much as I LOVE supporting locals, we just couldn’t do it the entire trip). \nThanks for the amazing place, Mike!"},{"_id":"248166820","date":{"$date":"2018-03-30T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15787147","reviewer_id":"24461246","reviewer_name":"Jim","comments":"Awesome location in a cool little town with great proximity to beaches, airport and rest of the island.

If you want to swim, find the \"baby beach\" ;).\n\nThe cottage is nice. As other guests have noted, it was very clean (with the exception of some plates, which previous guests probably didn't wash properly). Somewhat annoying were the neighbors in the run-down house/backyard on the right side (not the other cottage). One night a woman was screaming at a dog, the other night a man was berating a woman (I've never heard anyone scream the f-word that many times). There was also a nearby alarm somewhere in the neighborhood that went off for like 10-20 seconds some of the nights (never figured out where it came from).

The hosts are very kind and helpful! \n\nThe location is on Staten Island, about a 2 minute walk to bus stops leading to Manhattan/other parts of NYC, and about a 15 minute walk to the Staten Island Railway, which leads directly to a free 24/7 ferry between Staten and Manhattan. mass transit is much cheaper than taxis/ubers, so be sure to get a Metrocard for your trip. look into the price of a 7 day unlimited bus+subway pass, it is most likely the best option if you plan on taking the bus/train more than once a day.\n\nThe place is clean, comfortable, and fairly convenient. You do have to take a ~40 minute bus ride or a hour long rail+ferry ride to get to Manhattan, but I happily sat through the commute knowing that I saved a good chunk of money staying here, and that I was staying in comfort.

After spending 3 nights i can confidently tell you this apartment is full of character, depth, complexity and fun. It was as if I was living inside an oil painting. Every room felt like it had something refreshingly different to offer. I couldn’t help but appreciate the degree of comfort and creativity this place offered me as a guest.\n\nCommunication: 5/5\nFrom basic inquiries on the AirBNB platform to the exchanges we had via texts. Responses were immediate.\n\nAmenities: 5/5\nThere was nothing additional I could’ve thought to ask for outside what was already listed. Everything/Anything else was a pleasant surprise. \n\nCleanliness: 5/5\nNo complaints. Not one. Because the designs, colors, shapes, etc. cause you to take in the atmosphere it’s quite easy to see if there were areas of concern. I couldn’t find one.\n\nLocation: 5/5\nDependent on what you’re looking for or where you’re trying to go, this may vary. For my girlfriend and I, It was perfect. Restaurants are in walking distance. Ubereats is always an option. CVS is literally a min away. It was ideal.\n\nHost: I love Ella. 10/10\nBe it today’s social climate where people’s sentiment toward one another appear to be easily swayed because of political views, sexual orientation, etc. or the simple fact that you never know who you’ll meet or how they’ll treat you. As a black couple, we couldn’t help but feel like Ella was an extension of our own family.

We were immediately taken away by Anita’s incredible hospitality and generous assistance getting us acquainted with the place as well as the local surroundings. \n\nWe were instantly amazed by the ocean views seen from the kitchen window. Many of our mornings were spent waking to watch the sunrise over breakfast. The building is just a staircase away from the sand, couldn’t be more convenient. \n\nOur stay was made much more enjoyable having this place to call “home” during our time in Bondi, would highly recommend to anyone visiting Bondi!

Anita was very helpful.  We did not meet as she was off on a weekend trip as well, but that did not stop her from answering questions and being helpful.  The studio is everything that it states on the advert.  I think Anita has taken pains to show the view is partially blocked by the wall in one of the pictures.  Although the main picture in the advert must have been taken from hanging out the side window.  \n\nIf you move you bed just right - you can sit on the bed and watch the beach (or move a chair to the right spot).  It is not a vista, but you do get a view of the beach.\n\nOne thing I missed is that there is no air con.  It does not state that there is air con, but I just assumed that there would be.  There is a powerful fan that we did not have to turn on higher than the first setting.\n\nThe TV reception was really bad.  I am sure that if Anita had been around, she would have been able to sort it out.  She said that it was not a problem in the past.  At her suggestion we used the casting function to the TV.  We tried that with both our phones and laptop.  The result was a lag in the picture to the sound.  We did advise Anita that it was not a huge issue, and it wasn't.  \n\nThe studio is really close to everything and the place is cosy but not cluttered.  The location is just perfect and Anita was very helpful and accommodating.  We had a great time and unreservedly recommend this place.

Kai was very helpful when little things came up (dead garage battery in remote- he texted and gave replacement right away)\n\nPros: \n-clean \u0026 accurate descriptions\n-Super close to highway/and located within 15-45 min of all attractions of Oahu\n-Nice view of downtown from windows\n-Perfect for couples, family of 3 (2 adults/1 child), family of 4 (2 adults and 2 small children) - 4 adults is 'do-able' (like we experienced) but not recommended per listing\n-Communication prior \u0026 during stay was amazing. Kai was super nice and detailed in his instructions.\n\nCons:\n-small/difficult parking. One can find it difficult if you have little/no experience backing into a tight space (not an issue for us but I can imagine others would)\n-can be a little noisy (if all windows are open) since its near highway. Can't hear anything with windows shut :)\n-Not much access to many cooking items (not an issue unless you plan to cook a lot)\n\nGreat for small families \u003c 4, great value for location\n\nNot recommended for those who enjoy cooking a lot.

And this was a perfect base to explore the island as a tourist with a small rental car; the garage was too tight for the mid-full sized cars but it was FREE and big enough for my cute little Mini Roadster. FYI, you have to walk up the stairs and carry the luggages to your room. It’s no big deal as long as you’re not disabled. Not far from the highways, airport, downtown, Ala Moana Shopping Centre and Waikiki. I would stay here again given the opportunities.

The full size appliances was a great bonus. \n\nI’m originally from the island \u0026 came home for a family wedding. We needed a place to stay that was close enough to town for all the wedding activities.  It was a perfect place for my family of 3 (2 adults \u0026 a 6yo) to stay. It was close enough to downtown Honolulu \u0026 Waikiki AND Hawaii Kai, without being right in the city. It does overlook the freeway, but the windows are so wonderful that we hardly heard the noise. \n\nThe condo was very clean \u0026 the pull out couch was perfect for our little guy. It would be a perfect place for a business traveler or a family like ours that really just needs a great place to sleep \u0026 eat an occasional meal. It does have a steep staircase, but Kai \u0026 Tiffany make every attempt to make it safe by having a gate at the top of the stairs - still some parents of real little ones may feel a bit uncomfortable with it. We had no issues at all. Also, definitely head the recommendation to rent the smallest car possible. It’s a very tight turn around \u0026 the garage is tiny. We had requested an economy size, but were give a Pathfinder. My husband is a firefighter \u0026 is quite experienced parking big rigs, but I didn’t dare try. \n\nIf we ever find the need to rent another Airbnb while visiting my home town, we would not hesitate to stay here again."},{"_id":"287986377","date":{"$date":"2018-07-08T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15808180","reviewer_id":"180731583","reviewer_name":"Shanelle","comments":"Tiffany’s studio was very stylish \u0026 cute.

Tiffany has considered everything: there is a coffee maker, filters, and coffee in the kitchen (which is really important after a long flight!) and other items too like an iron, wash towels, beach towels, shampoo, sun screen, that are super thoughtful. We found it helpful to close the bedroom door to keep the cool air from the mini-split upstairs. There is a coin-operated washer and dryer in the garage if you need them. The Ford Versa we rented from Budget was a little tight, but my husband is an expert 'backer-upper.'  I usually got out of the car before he put it in the garage. Though, we didn't need to drive everywhere.  Some of the great places we walked to are Foster Botanical Garden, Liliʻuokalani Botanical Garden, Honolulu Beer Works, and Aloha Brewing Company.

Also no elevator, no problem for me, but might be for elderly. If you're looking for a palace, look else where. But if you need a quiet place to sleep that has clean bedding and a proper bathroom, then the value of this place is great. For the price it's a great deal. You'll be happy.

The apartment is a very short walk to the Lapa metro station, which is about 30 minutes away from the airport, though note that the airport metro is quite infrequent and can get very full, so factor in that wait time.\n\nThere are plenty of coffee shops, a bakery, and restaurants around to have a nice breakfast before you go out for a day of sight-seeing. And if you're late risers like us, you can't beat the €4.50 fixed price lunch you can get, for instance, at the restaurants on Rua do Paraiso nearby. Also, if you're feeling like a glass of wine or port or a cup of tea after a long day of walking and sight-seeing, we highly recommend a place called BUuh!, at Praça da República 164 (on the way home from city centre). Amazingly cozy atmosphere, with beautiful mid-20th century antique furniture, playing 60s and 70s rock music, and a wide selection of teas and pastries.\n\nOur host, João, was very nice and communicative.

Depois de termos combinado os detalhes da nossa estadia (check-out, etc.), o João ainda teve tempo para nos dar informações úteis para os próximos dias. Explicou-nos qual a melhor cave de Vinho do Porto, os pontos mais interessantes da cidade, etc. Mesmo já conhecendo a cidade do Porto, aprendemos detalhes importantes e viemos a conhecer lugares que desconhecíamos anteriormente. Muito obrigado, João!     \nO apartamento fica perto da estação Faria Guimarães. Mesmo havendo estações menos distantes, vale a pena ter em conta o aviso do João para sair em Faria Guimarães. :D Apesar de o apartamento não ficar muito longe do centro, é importante notar que demora mais ou menos 15 minutos para chegar a pé à Avenida dos Aliados e a outros sítios importantes da cidade. \nO apartamento é bastante giro e bem organizado (com uma decoração muita moderna). Não temos queixa de nada. Pois, encontrámos tudo aquilo que necessitávamos. Fica na zona histórica do bairro da Lapa que é uma zona muito tranquila e bonita com cafés e restaurantes tradicionais.

He also made sure we were comfortable, especially since we are traveling with our 4 month old baby girl (we all shared the rather large bed and were quite fine).

Easy to get to and from the Ribeira area (aside from all the hills). The only 2 things that could’ve been better is the wifi in the bedroom and the noise above us - from about 11PM there is a lot of stomping and while we stayed here there was hammering and drilling for 2 mornings on the row - but obviously this may not be the case when you stay here.

Great location, 3-4 minute walk to Wan Chai metro, easy to commute pretty much anywhere in HK. Lots of stores and restaurants right outside the building.\r\nCarlos is a great host, even though you might not see him much, he'll do everything to make you comfortable. Took care of all little details (adapter, bath towel, laundry advice etc.) and it's very easy to communicate with him. Highly recommend the place to stay, if you're not too picky about room space, but there's so much to do in HK, it's not worth sitting in the room. I spent here 20 days without any issues and will definitely come back if I'm in HK again.\r\nThank you!\r\nMiko"},{"_id":"126701973","date":{"$date":"2017-01-13T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15834431","reviewer_id":"6353866","reviewer_name":"Klaas-Harm","comments":"Carlos was very helpful and the studio was exactly what I needed.

After two nights I requested to move to another room so that I can sleep. The other room was smaller but had no dripping sound. I slept better but if it was hot and I had to switch on the aircon, it makes a loud humming sound. This room is cleaner but the toilet light was not working.

This place met all of our wishes. There is plenty of street parking and the neighborhood feels safe enough. It's not the fanciest neighborhood, but we were very comfortable and felt like locals. The house was very clean and decorated well. The beds were comfortable, but more on the firm side, FYI. The kitchen had all the necessary tools and every appliance worked well. The bathroom was clean and the shower had strong water pressure. There is a washer and dryer that works well, but we only used it once since Marylu had left plenty of linens and towels for us. There is a large Safeway grocery store about a mile away, and a liquor store and gas station just a couple blocks down the street.\r\n\r\nMarylu was very quick to respond to my emails and was very accommodating even though we didn't need anything else or have any complaints.  \r\n\r\nWe had an amazing time and a big reason was this cottage.

We fit a group of seven comfortably when we were in town for a friend's wedding.  The well-supplied kitchen meant we could save money by preparing several meals at the house.  But the house is also close to the beach (~20 min. walk) and several good places to eat, including the delicious Side Street Inn.  \r\n\r\nI loved reading and barbecuing in the yard.  There were plenty of towels and beach supplies for everyone.  Besides the bathroom being a bit busy with seven people, it was very clean and the shower pressure and temperature level were great.  The welcome package was a nice touch.  \r\n\r\nAs others have mentioned, the only issue we had was with noise.  There's not much sound insulation between the house and the street or the neighboring houses.  I would suggest bringing earplugs if you're a light sleeper.  Also, the neighbors stopped by one night to ask that we keep the conversation down after 10 so that's good to keep in mind in advance.  \r\n\r\nAlso, a lot of the outlets are two-prong.  It could be useful to bring a 3-prong to 2-prong adapter.  \r\n\r\nWe'd all definitely stay again - thanks so much!  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"_id":"12781082","date":{"$date":"2014-05-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1583670","reviewer_id":"480447","reviewer_name":"Derek","comments":"The house was better than expected!

If I had any questions Marylu would respond quickly. She also made the check in and check out process easy.\r\nRental:\r\nThe location of the house is ideal for a visit to Honolulu. It is literally 8-10 mins away from everything you need; Waikiki beach, restaurants, Safeway, Starbucks and bars. We would take a cab to most of these places and the fare was always less than $10. the house has many beds. I think it can fit up to a group of 10 people. There is no A/C but the windows and ceiling fans through out made the house cooler. Marylu also provided extra towels and bed sheets which were very helpful. We were unable to get the washer machine to work and had to go to the laundry mat near by. Instructions on the machine would have helped. Also there is no microwave only a stove, coffee maker, fridge and dishwasher. A microwave would have definitely been used and appreciated.\r\n\r\nOverall the experience was great and I would definitely stay at Marylu's house again."},{"_id":"22358110","date":{"$date":"2014-11-04T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1583670","reviewer_id":"19544379","reviewer_name":"Machiko","comments":"3回目のﾊﾜｲで､ﾎﾃﾙ滞在に飽きだしていたのでこちらの宿を借りましたが､とても良かったです｡\n目の前の通りは意外と車が通り､音はそれなりに気になりましたが､60歳の父は､自然の風が適度に入ってくるﾘﾋﾞﾝｸﾞで気持ち良さそうに昼寝していましたし､浮輪やｼｭﾉｰｹﾙやﾎﾞﾃﾞｨｰﾎﾞｰﾄﾞなども借りれて､息子もとても喜んでいました｡\n徒歩5分位歩くと､有名なｶﾌｪやﾊﾝﾊﾞｰｶﾞｰｼｮｯﾌﾟ､軽食を買えるお店もあります｡また､近隣の家々も､ｵｰﾙﾄﾞﾊﾜｲ的な素敵な家が多く､歩いていてとても楽しかったです｡\n海までは､子連れだと少し距離を感じたので､自転車か車があったらﾍﾞｽﾄかもしれません｡"},{"_id":"23203502","date":{"$date":"2014-11-25T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1583670","reviewer_id":"1161380","reviewer_name":"Roopa","comments":"This cute house was great for our group of 6!

We cooked and just felt we had a home in sydney ! \n\nThe suit is so spacious and comfortable that i could stay for the whole day doing nothing. But sitting in my sun room watching the breath taking view from the window. We spent a lot of time on the beach and walked up to the golf club. We didn't swim but still there is a nice pool from where you can see far into the great ocean. There is even dive boat every friday for people to go diving !\n\nIt is close to everywhere. Less than 15 minutes drive to city and almost 1 hour drive to all the southern  attractions.

They were there if we needed anything, but also gave us our space.  The home is as advertised in their description.  Bus service just a few steps from your front door.  Strong WiFi signal.  \r\n\r\nYou will find that the bed isn't as comfortable as the one you may have at home, but we slept very well with the ocean breeze cooling the apartment.  \r\n\r\nLaundry Room is around back of the Main House so be prepared to walk back and forth to manage your laundry.\r\n\r\nBeach Cafe nearby is open everyday for Breakfast and Lunch but is only open for dinner on Friday and Saturday from 500-830.  Excellent food.\r\n\r\nGroceries can best be found in Maroubra at Woolies or Coles.  There are also freshmarkets and meat shops there as well.  Great place to stock up if you are cooking for yourselves.\r\n\r\nBus Service.  The 399 is the main bus you will use for most trips you make.  End of the line is Circular Quay in the CBD with no transfers.  Recommend getting an Opal Card to make travel quicker and easier.   **TIP** You will need an Opal Card for each traveller, you cannot share them for multiple riders.\r\n\r\nAirport Travel.  Take the 400 to Maroubra near PIcadilly Place and transfer to the 399 Little Bay.  $3.50 per person vs $40 taxi ride.\r\n\r\nBeach Walks.  We took the walk from the apartment to Coogee, about 4 miles.  Beautiful walk, but the 1st 1/3 of the walk you are cutting across neighborhoods and parks as the boardwalk isn't complete to Malabar yet.  Bondi to Coogee was very easy to navigate.  You should do both!\r\n\r\nOverall - We would highly recommend this location for Couples or a small familyon Holiday.  You will feel very \"local\" staying here, but the CBD and action of Sydney is only a 45 minute bus ride away with no transfers.\r\n\r\nThanks Fred and Bernadette for starting our Australian tour off with a bang!"},{"_id":"23990494","date":{"$date":"2014-12-16T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1584102","reviewer_id":"21574461","reviewer_name":"Stephen","comments":"Beautiful setting and very comfortable accommodation.

We thought we knew Sydney pretty well but this area will become one of our favourite new spots.  My (then partner and now) wife Karen stayed here with her bridal party as we searched for accommodation that would allow us to be close to where we would marry the next day.  Fred greeted us warmly on arrival which included a lovely celebratory champagne bottle, a congratulations card, and the most yummy chocolate slices (that were demolished on sight!) - such a thoughtful touch and greatly appreciated.  The accommodation itself was even better than we'd hoped.  Immaculately furnished, clean to a tee, very spacious, with super comfy beds and living area - just what you want when you're   wanting to chillax inside and out.  This was our equal first airbnb experience (Karen stayed here and I was 5 minutes away in other accommodation), and this sets the highest bar for all future bookings.  Bernie was really easy to deal with during the booking experience and accommodating and flexible to any particular requests we put forward. Great hosts but even better people.  Really, everything you needed was there at your fingertips.

Fred/Bernadette provided us with a detailed book on how to get around, where to go for food, best spots in Sydney, and even nearby attractions. They made the arrival process very easy by providing us very good details on how to get to the house. \r\n\r\nThe house itself had a 12/10 view! It really is spectacular to see the coast across the street when you wake up in the morning. The house had plenty of amenities and we did not want for anything.

It was very convenient to go to the beach by foot and it was a good beach for a little one. Be aware that depending on weather conditions the beach can be quite dirty, but it is cleaned very regularly so we just had this once. It was easy to take the bus into town: it is not running very often (twice per hour) but it is just on the door step. Same to reach a small shopping center, 10-15 minutes away by bus (+ waiting time). With one change, you reach Maroubra or other beaches or a big shopping center. We cooked in the apartment, no problem for basics. The kitchen is quite new and has enough space. We appreciate the large fridge, freezer and dishwasher. The laundry is to be shared with the owner and you can usually dry the clothes in the sun. We appreciated the big shower, hot and stable temperature and the bathroom in general. The flat is airy even on hot days, except the main sleeping room. We did not need the provided fans. In the sun room you can let the door open and hear the waves at night (but then also a bit of traffic). The sun room couch bed is very soft (flabby?). For one person just ok. But I wouldn't want to share it. We appreciated the moskito nets everywhere. Kitchen and bath were very clean but the floors and shelves could have need a bit more care. Bernadette and Fred were welcoming and very reactive as we had a problem. It was a very nice, laid-back beach accommodation. With possibility to enjoy a few days in Sydney downtown. A good compromise with a child."},{"_id":"236926608","date":{"$date":"2018-02-20T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1584102","reviewer_id":"30887766","reviewer_name":"Mary","comments":"What a great place!\nWonderful location, perfect hosts and excellent facilities.\nWe received a warm welcome with fresh juice and milk in the fridge together with a delicious home made cake on arrival.\nWould recommend to anyone looking for a lovely peaceful place which is within really easy access of the city and other areas of Sydney."},{"_id":"238503831","date":{"$date":"2018-02-25T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1584102","reviewer_id":"40899994","reviewer_name":"Richard","comments":"What a great place and a fantastic location!

Considering the night life in the neighbourhood, it's not a completely tranquil place - the bedroom faces a small residential street near the corner of one of the main drags (Avenue Mont-Royal) but you can still get a good night's rest if you're not hypersensitive to occasional outdoor acoustics. Both Collin and i had busy schedules, so we didn't coincide on a daily basis, but one night we shared a fantastic meal whose ingredients had been grown organically on urban rooftops in Montreal.

Colin was really helpful providing us with excellent places to eat and go out. We didn't have much of a plan coming to Montreal and he was quick to fill us with ideas! His place is cozy so it can feel a little cramped with more than 3 people. The only area to hangout is the kitchen or the bedroom but if you plan on just using the  apartment as a place to crash then its great!

They are both beyond friendly and helpful in making your way around the city :) The flat is in a beautiful area of the city, surrounded by cafes and boutiques. All the rest of the hustle and bustle is within walking distance or biking distance, as I opted for. There is a bixi bike stand just around the corner from Colin's place and this made it super convenient to come and go. The room and bathroom were clean!! This was a huge test for me...and I was grateful for the cleanliness factor. The apartment was hot while I was there (outside temp of +37 with the humidity) but there is a fan in the room which allowed me to sleep well at night.  I suggest ear plugs if you are a light sleeper, I go everywhere with mine, but I know I would have struggled with the outdoor traffic and creeky floors if I didn't have them :)\r\n\r\nI couldn't have asked for a better experience, thanks you guys!

The photos of the room and space on airbnb are accurate - it's nice and cozy, faces a relatively quiet street so you have peace at night, but best of all, it's in a fantastic neighborhood. We loved that it's close to the metro, steps away from one of the best bakeries and excellent restaurants...just a fabulous way to soak Montreal in.\n\nThis being our first time, my husband was super nervous about \"staying in someone's home.\" But it really felt so much more personal than being in a hotel, especially with their gorgeous \"cloud-like\" cat Chippie!

It felt unsafe at first (quite a few people suffering from addictions) but we had no problems at all. Fairly quick subway ride into lower Manhattan. Some loud banging, clanging neighborhood noises in the morning on two occasions. Jed was very hospitable and kind enough to stay up late for us as our flight into NYC was delayed.

He definitely isn't kidding when he forewarns his guests that on Friday and Saturday nights the party is popping off in the living room. We didn't mind at all and either slept right through it or joined in on the fun! Jed is a superhost for sure: fast response times, super friendly but gives privacy, and is happy to give you hot neighborhood tips. The location is spectacular, you could throw a rock and hit the JMZ. Perfect for tourists who want a taste of Brooklyn, but do want to go to Manhattan a lot to do touristy things.

Additionally the last three nights were completely disastrous, the host arrived two days in a row at 4 am with a lot of people to continue the party until dawn, obviously the noise of the people talking and the music did not let us sleep, the last night It was not better either because he stayed until 2 in the morning walking, cooking and slaming doors, which also did not let us sleep. Even though he knew that we should wake up very early to take our flight back.

The room was small and comfortable, but the hospitality was sub-par. The host had strict check-in and out times between 4p and 11am, when the key was actually in a drop box waiting. We weren’t told where to find the key, and had to message multiple times, and then finally call to get those instructions.  She said she sent me a message, but on my end I did not receive anything. When we came back after midnight from seeing a show, the host forgot we were there and locked us out with the indoor chain lock. We stood outside banging on the door and ringing the doorbell until she opened it and said she “forgot.” There wasn’t much said after that except for a goodbye in the morning. The room was fine for the cost and the bed was nice, but it wasn’t welcoming and ended up creating more headache.

Nora was very nice in our communication and gave us her contact details to contact her at any time.\n\nWhen I look at booking airbnb or any kind of place to stay, I would like to read reviews that are honest and useful and therefore intend to do the same for others. \n\nThe location of the apartment is good, close to a subway and surrounded by nice places to eat, conveince stores and feels like a safe neigbourhood. Wifi works fine. \n\nThe bathroom has a shower and is not the one shown, at the current time, on the photos. The shower and bathroom floor was very dirty in my opinion (e.g. greasy, mouldy) and compared to any other any air bnb we have stayed at. Especially when you look at paying a cleaning fee.\n\nThe bed is not very comfortable, and I dont think I would be able to stay there for more than one night. The door handles' latch does not work and for that reason also not the door lock. \n\nIn my opinion, this was fine for one night however taking into consideration that you have to pay for a service and cleaning fee, its cheaper to stay for more than one night.

And good art, there's some good art too.  The kitchen is very nice and you can use it, so you don't have to go out for coffee in the morning.  The room I stayed in was clean, private, and comfortable and it has an en suite bathroom.  Oh, one thing: there's no full length mirror so if you're going somewhere, you won't know what you look like, so I'd advise checking your outfit carefully before you leave on your trip.  Or I guess you could just not stress about it, that would be an option too.   There's a private entrance to the room so if you come in late (or whatever) you don't have to go through the house, and there's dedicated parking right next to the room's door, so you don't have to worry about whether you're parked in someone's space.  You're not.  Except that I accidentally ran over a tool box that was sitting in the driveway one day, since I'm short and couldn't see over the Jeep's dash, so that's something to be aware of.   I saw some gorgeous wild turkeys in the area and a lot of very cute wild chickens.  I tried feeding the chickens but they were supremely disinterested in me and my stupid food, so don't bother wasting your bread on them, they think you're an asshole.  Or maybe it was just me.   Let's see, what else... Stephen and his friend Kate were super helpful, providing me with driving information and hints about cool places to go, and without Stephen's advice I probably would have wasted time trying to go places (such as forest refuges) that are accessible only on certain, very limited days.   So if anyone has read this far and they're thinking of visiting a forest refuge during their stay, I'd advise you to check the schedule right now, before you leave, so you can plan accordingly.   So this has become a little verbose, but in closing let me just add that I had a very nice stay at Stephen's and I felt like I got a very good deal for the price.

Like so many other reviewers I too had a great experience of generosity and good conversation; swapping stories, cracking jokes. I felt at ease almost immediately; welcomed and included. Stephen was also very helpful with travel tips as were his housemates. I will be going back most definitely.\n Though the property is about 15 minutes high above town it does get you away from all the touristy stuff with the added bonus of a deck with  sweeping  views.

Right away we got great friendly vibes from them and their roommates staying there too. The room is a great size and the bed is comfortable. Leaving the windows open listening to the sounds of the night was such a great way to sleep and be awoken each morning. The house is beautifully made, wood everywhere, they have 100s of records for listening and a comfortable sectional that face toward a beautiful ocean view. They have a massive lanai that is great for having all your meals or just your morning coffee. \n\nSteve made great recommendations of places to go and things to do from the Kona area. He supplied us with a Hawaii revealed travel book and set us up for a whole day of activities. Kua Bay is a really nice beach area close by. It's a great starting point to make the drive to Mauna Kea observatory, although the road to the summit was closed for our stay due to snow/ice, we enjoyed the sunset from a peak near the visitor centre. \n\nWould love to go back and visit Steve and Kate again."},{"_id":"234710645","date":{"$date":"2018-02-13T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15902696","reviewer_id":"158227680","reviewer_name":"Alan","comments":"Highly recommended!

It was close to a bunch of places to eat and about a 5-10min walk to the beach. The big TV was nice and it was also great to have a fridge for food. Ala Mona Shopping Center and Royal Hawaiian Center are both within walking distance.\n\nMy biggest complaint was that there is only one key and elevator fob; meaning that whenever my partner had to go to work I had to get up to let him out, and make sure I was available when he needed to get back in. You can't even go down the elevator without it. \n\nAlso due to circumstances outside Oleksandr's control the sink was clogged when we arrived. We had two different people come and look at it over a two day period. It was inconvenient because we wanted to be in the room while someone was there. While out to eat one evening the plumber did show up without our knowledge, which we had hoped to have some notice before anyone came."},{"_id":"129578146","date":{"$date":"2017-01-31T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15904149","reviewer_id":"57336926","reviewer_name":"Kyungae","comments":"Great owner great room condition great location\nOleksandr was always quick responser.

This apartment was just right for us mostly because of the PRICE! You will not find a deal like this anywhere on Oahu. The apartment was clean and well stocked. Very accurate. Great location. Anywhere in Waikiki is going to be impossible to find cheap parking. You can park in the building over night for $20 but have to be out by 7 am, or you can park in the coffee house parking garage and that's $15 over night. But honestly this place was a really good deal so I didn't mind paying the parking fees. AC, TV, WIFI, shower, lanai, check in, check out, SO GREAT, SO EASY and SO simple and the second I booked, Oleksandr communicated on everything we needed to know. I have stayed at probably five places on Oahu with Airbnb and this is the first time every instruction and detail was 100% right and everything went smooth. We had zero problems. For those of you visiting our island, don't spend big bucks on a super fancy tropical ocean front hotel room. You're coming here to explore Hawaii not look at the water from your window. Just get somewhere to sleep and spend your days enjoying our island. Trust me, you will save HUGE! The food is already expensive enough, you don't need to pay $300+ a night to sleep somewhere in the exact same area as this perfect little inexpensive condo.

The beds are clean and comfortable, and the kitchen is stocked with plates, bowls, cutlery, and a full-sized fridge. Basics such as bath towels and bed linens, but be aware that you must bring your own tissues, shampoo/body soap, coat/clothes hangers, and beach towels. The air-con is very helpful, especially in summer! The building has excellent washing machines and dryers, but make sure you have your own laundry liquid (not powder!) and a credit card to swipe in order to use them. The apartment is an easy 10-minute walk from the lagoon, and an easy 20-25 minute walk to Waikiki Beach. It's also close to many bus stops that take you further afield to places such as Diamondhead, Ala Moana Mall, downtown Honolulu, etc. Max provides clear instructions so check-in procedures are very easy, but only one key and elevator card is provided, which can sometimes be inconvenient if you and your travel buddy leave and enter the apartment at different times (but not a problem if you're going to stick together). The wifi is strong, and Max is quick to reply to messages. All in all, a great apartment if you want to enjoy a comfortable holiday in Honolulu!"},{"_id":"176425054","date":{"$date":"2017-07-30T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15904149","reviewer_id":"51677860","reviewer_name":"Evgeny","comments":"The apartment has a nice location and the windows overlook the inner yard, so it's very calm at night. And in general it's very close to the beaches, but it's around 20mins by foot away from the more vivid area with bars and restaurants. The size of the room is really small and there is no wardrobe for clothes, only a couple of shelves. It's fine for a budget staying, but the main issue was that, although the apartment has two beds for two people, there is only one key available!

The apartment is on the 9th floor with a decent view of some other buildings and a chill patio where you can see some of the mountains in the distance. There was plenty of room for the 3 of us and were able to quickly feel right at home. If you're looking for a place to store your stuff and relax/sleep, then this is perfect. If you expect luxury or would consider yourself picky, then you probably won't like the place.

This is an old fashioned family area with respectful residents... it is a blending of the old and the new, both the family generations and their homes. This is most definitely a small vintage town feel in a residential area of Oahu with local flair. There is a strong cohesiveness and lively sense of longevity. It's common to see neighbors visit in the yards and help one another with whatever is going on and everyone has a friendly word to say or at least a smile and wave. You will also commonly see fishermen all along the beach, as well as outrigger canoe rowers practicing when in season. This area has many popular activities including fishing, surfing, boogie boarding and snorkeling. You will see all these happening daily along with local families coming and going for their daily routines. It's definitely authentic residential Hawaii.","notes":"Please tell us a little about you with your inquiry and what brings you to visit the islands.

An interesting piece of local history= the original home on this property was the very first on this street way back in the late 30's....We have just updated it to current standards.  To give you a little history of this particular vintage area called Ewa Beach Road... it was originally developed in the 1930's for summer homes at Oceanfront for the upper class of Honolulu and the command class of the military with Property Lots which are typically 50' wide and 200-300' deep creating privacy and so","transit":"A car would be the most convenient way to utilize this vacation house due to the residential neighborhood setting. There are bus lines close by but the routes are very limited getting to the sightseeing areas of the island. It is very centrally located to all the best amenities as you can see by looking at our location on the map. There are no grocery stores or shops within walking distance, but there is a small convenience store about a block down the street.","access":"Guests may come and go at their leisure knowing they have private gated parking and a fully complete home for their comforts while vacationing.

I have a delightful military couple as long term tenants who sometimes help as additional property managers. My guests who stay at \"Hale Honulei\" will be sharing the entrance gate and driveway with them but otherwise are completely independent of one another. Washer/Dryer and BBQ are not shared.

We came to visit Hawaii over 20yrs ago, fell in love with the islands, sold everything we had and moved! The thought was if we fail, no harm done! I feel blessed every day to call Hawaii home. Although I do miss my family on the mainland, I (we) have our other half with us here, Mother and Father in law moved here 12+ yrs  and my Brother and sister in law just 2+ years ago! Being able to get together every Sunday to cook and enjoy each other is something I don’t take for granted.  Love the ocean, with my favorite past time now which is stand up paddle boarding. I was a Dental Assistant for a total of 18 yrs, then quit to help my husband run his construction company. Never did I think I would be doing a bnb, (always have done long term) but oh how I enjoy it!! Love people and enjoy them seeing the islands for their first time or coming back for more to do something they missed or needs repeating...never can one see it all. I hope you will come and enjoy our little slice of Hawaii here on the west side of the island.

Michele had a book with ideas of what to do while we were there.  We tried out 3 of the eating ideas she recommended and they were great.  (Eating at the close by country club was a hidden gem.)

Our 3rd stay here (first at this house though) and it never disappoints. The beach is only a quick 1 minute walk through a public path, where we watched the sun rise every morning with our coffee, and sun set every evening. We only saw a couple of people on the beach each time (mostly for the sun rises) so it's a pleasant contrast to the busy beaches elsewhere. We only had to walk a little ways down the beach to find a sandy entrance to the water (a lot of that area close to the path has coral) where we spent a lot of time snorkeling \u0026 exploring.  \nThe house is very equipped, with all the dishes \u0026 appliances you need, and we even had homemade banana nut bread \u0026 fresh fruit waiting for us when we arrived. The beds were extremely comfortable, and even our party of 5 stayed comfortably in there. The ottoman pulls out into a bed, which our friend slept comfortably on the entire week. \nAlso, there are a couple snorkels, boogie boards, grass mats, coolers, chairs, etc. Seriously, you really have everything you need. \nOverall a great stay \u0026 we wouldn't hesitate to book this place again.  Michele was an extremely friendly host \u0026 has an amazingly stocked house for all your needs!

It is nothing Michele can control and it wasn’t every single night, but for a light sleeper like me  it was a bit annoying.\nBut on that note everything else was over and beyond what anyone could ask."},{"_id":"407347619","date":{"$date":"2019-02-01T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15905296","reviewer_id":"6075199","reviewer_name":"Todd","comments":"We wanted a place away from the tourist areas and this definitely fit the bill—not an ABC store for miles. Michele’s home offered the right amount of comfort and amenities. Super clean. Loved the lanai for morning coffee and pau hana drinks. It’s just a 30-yard jog to the beach. Note that her home is in a humble working-class community. On the street you will pass the random appliance on the side of the road and hear a barking dog or a motorcycle or two. But it’s very quiet and chill, you get the real deal Hawai’i.

It would be my parents first Airbnb experience so I wanted to make sure it was a great one.  From the first time I messaged Michele all the way until check in when she greeted them with kindness (and banana bread), I knew my parents would be taken care of.  They said the house was filled with everything they needed.  The street felt safe and they talked to a lot of the \"locals\" that lived there.  The walkway to the beach was just a house or so over which they thought was nice.  Overall it was a great experience for my parents \u0026 their friends and I was happy that I chose Michele's place to send them to!"},{"_id":"410174112","date":{"$date":"2019-02-09T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15905296","reviewer_id":"178131622","reviewer_name":"Rhonda","comments":"This home was amazing.

The supplies were also running low and we had to replenish them (though he did reimburse us). The trash can had something sticky and gooey in it so we just used trash bags without the dustbin. The tea supplies were past expiry date. All in all an unpleasant experience - wouldn’t go there again. Oliver says his cleaners let him down! Anyway, he refunded the cleaning fees, but frankly I expected a clean place to begin with with a so called “5 Star” host. Spoiled our trip.

We walked everywhere with no problems. \nOnly couple of negatives are the steepness of the stairs. They were pretty steep and scary for a toddler. \nOne of the pullout sofas is in a room accessed through one of the bedrooms. \nBeing an old building we had a few issues with having heating on and boiling kettles etc at the same time. \nAnd the welcome pack wasn't exactly as shown in pics. \nCommunication with Suzanna was great though. And she managed to sort any problems quite promptly. \nProperty was very clean. \nWould definitely recommend it to others. But maybe not for families with toddlers.

This place is ideal for 3 couples and one single, due to the bedding arrangements. The sofa bed is not the typical foldout, it is small, hard and really not usable.

The wifi is solid.  The TV also has a radio option, which is nice if you just want some background noise.  The washing machine, stove, and dishwasher work without any problems.  There is also an oven, but I never used it.\n\nMarcella is amazing!  She worked with me on check-in which made it easy and seamless, and she was flexible with check-out.

My husband and I arrived to the beautiful property after a long day of touring. We were overwhelmed by the odor of old fireplace and mildew, so severe that we needed to leave after 10-15 minutes and notified the owner that we would not be staying there. The furniture and bedding were faded and dusty. My allergies and asthma were so aggravated that I required medical attention upon return to Oahu. We (luckily) were able to secure lodging at a nearby B and B recommended by the state park. The innkeeper stayed late and accepted cash because the credit machine was down for the night. We did not request a full refund of $258, but did ask that \"Roxanne\" reimburse us for the other lodging ($120). She continued to bombard me with messages, claiming to not receive photos that I sent multiple times. Then requested an invoice from the other B and B (which we had no reason to have as it was impeccable and we paid cash ). We still have  not received the partial refund, and likely won't after posting this review. Very poor customer service and I hope she uses the $258 to purchase a deep cleaning and dehumidifier. Save your money and stay at the state park or volcano inn.

An exceptionally comfy king bed. We enjoyed the hot tub and the fireplace and, especially, proximity to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, which provided hikes enough for more than the time we had. A near drive to Mauna Kea for stargazing and Mauna Loa for hiking, plus just 20 miles or so from Hilo. There's lots of rain, but how else would the green be so green and the birds so happy? Note that it is a short drive (8 minutes or so) to small groceries and cafes, and the property, while having other residences in the area, is quite secluded-feeling, especially at night.

Both my husband and I needed plenty of rest and down time, as we worked our way through an illness, but staying at Anthirium Alii Gardens was a wonderful retreat and respite from the rest of the world, its like everything else melted away. Once we realized that the adventures we had planned trekking around Volcano were not to be had, and that we would spend our time simply soaking in the healing, green space that we were in, our whole outlook changed. From our time at Anthirum Alii Gardens.. Aloha! Waking up here in Volcano National Park, surrounded by the rainforest to start my 55th year off is truly amazing. I am surrounded by this green, healing light of the forest and the sound of the tropical birds and rain on the tin roof, there is not another soul to be seen or heard. The forest is so deep here; its layers repeat with Fiddlehead Ferns, ‘ōhi‘a Trees, and Anthirums until your eye can't distinguish anymore. Our drive around the remote and windy south point of Hawaii yesterday brought us to this wonderful spot, The Anthirium Alii Gardens, in Volcano. As we entered the home from the private driveway, just a short distance from the crater, we were stunned and breathless seeing the surroundings we would get to enjoy. We spent our mornings eating Macadamia Nut Cookies and drinking Coffee in front of the fire, or in the vast hot tub, or sitting on the veranda overlooking the garden. We listened to the continuing lull of the rain and birds, a little bit of heaven in this most remote part of the earth, for sure. I was taking in the last of the days light overlooking the expansive rainforest garden while sitting on the veranda of this magical sanctuary when I finished writing this... I am enjoying the seranade of all the birds, the comfortable coolness of the humid rainforest air. There is not an unlikeable sound to be heard; no cars, horns, chainsaws, dogs or people barking...pure unadulterated blissful peace. No light (Website hidden by Airbnb) all. I look forward to once again sleeping amidst all of this tranquilty, waking in the morning to the birdsong and lush greenery, making a nice strong cup of coffee in the morning to enjoy out on the veranda in my PJ's. I highly recommend this peaceful place if you ever come to Volcano National Park, its big enough for six people, has a wonderful, large hot tub surrounded by the forest, plenty of seating and cooking utensils, a wonderful fireplace that we shared our meal in front of. Its a place to connect and restore. You will feel as though you are in your own private Polynesia. Maybe if you are lucky, as I was, you will get a visit from the Pheasants in the morning while you enjoy the quiet of the forest and the simplicity of..."},{"_id":"246675414","date":{"$date":"2018-03-25T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15943568","reviewer_id":"103781316","reviewer_name":"Meredith","comments":"Loved the place, beautiful \u0026 thoughtful touches!"},{"_id":"249777164","date":{"$date":"2018-04-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15943568","reviewer_id":"3189332","reviewer_name":"Martha","comments":"The yard and house are gorgeous.

My wife and son were particularly unnerved with the repeated earthquakes that we felt at the house due to the ongoing eruptions. We have never felt earthquakes before and it was kind of alarming. \n\nThe house could use some work. The outside of the house is covered in cobwebs and the deck on one side of the house is unusable.

Has the feeling of a well-loved family cottage, yet filled with an eclectic mix of furniture and artworks. The gardens are a lush backdrop of green. We visited while the National park was closed due to volcanic activity, but this did not deter us from staying, as for us, it was the coolest part! \n\nWe experienced the earth shifting and shaking, at times it was like standing on a wobble board, which was quite incredible - The ground vibrations felt in the area are from the caldera collapsing. It did take us a day to get used, as at first we didn't fully understand what the shaking was all about. However, if you get chance to chat with one of the rangers set up in three locations near the park (one was in the Volcano art center during our stay) they explained exactly what was happening with the volcano, so from there we just enjoyed the ride experiencing Mother Nature at work! \n\nThe hot tub is also lovely and on a clear night, the stars are beautiful to enjoy. If you are lucky enough to be there on a Sunday, take a stroll over to the farmers market. It starts at 6 am and most goodies are gone in the first hour, so get up early!!! We didn't get there till after 8, but it was still a nice stroll and very local experience. \n\n"},{"_id":"292767552","date":{"$date":"2018-07-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15943568","reviewer_id":"124813162","reviewer_name":"Kristin","comments":"What a lovely surprise! A peaceful retreat with an old world feel.  We had booked way in advance with the plan to visit Volcanoes National Park.  Well, Kilauea had other ideas... Nonetheless, the experience was great. We visited the black sand beach at Punalu'u (with many, many sea turtles) and the outstanding botanical garden just north of Hilo.  In between, we enjoyed the cool, lush surroundings back at the house.\n\nOn a practical note, the house is well away from the active eruption zone and not in the path for vog or ash.  There is essentially no discernable effect at the house from Kilauea except that every once in a while there is a bit of vibration if there is some slumping over at the Kilauea crater."},{"_id":"295595507","date":{"$date":"2018-07-23T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15943568","reviewer_id":"68861673","reviewer_name":"Jessica","comments":"We loved staying at this house in thr jungle thst offered s comfortable and lush homebase for adventure!"},{"_id":"330691017","date":{"$date":"2018-09-30T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15943568","reviewer_id":"112446640","reviewer_name":"Leah","comments":"So very warm and inviting.

Terry was super nice to talk to but she allowed you to set the boundaries so if you wanted to be social, you could and if you didn't want to be,you could have your privacy. Even though the listing technically says that you have a private room and washroom to yourself, I actually had the entire place to myself many days. Terry went the extra mile by taking me out to Salsa night for my birthday and we've had her home-cooked dinner while watching movies. The room comes with several guides on stuff to do in Sydney as well. Everything was clean and there was ample space in the fridge and the cupboards to store your food. Amazing experience overall.

This is my first host failure with airbandb. I was also disappointed airbandb provided no resolution for this issue. So I am not sure what to others renting from this host. Possibly there was a real issue with the apartment that was identified 10 days before my visit but could not be fixed by my arrival or they realized they rented it to me at too cheap a price and canceled the reservation knowing I would be stuck."},{"_id":"160800216","date":{"$date":"2017-06-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15973865","reviewer_id":"26534582","reviewer_name":"Philipp M.","comments":"Stay perfectly on 26th floor in Montreal!\n\nThe condo is directly in downtown perfectly located.

However when I contacted the host asking if I could check-in at 3pm, the host told me that I could only check-in at 9pm. After I said that this late time was unacceptable, the host suggested that I could check-in at 6pm. Since I had no other option I had to accept this offer. Then the other problem was that I arrived at the apartment at 6pm - as agreed - but I had to wait 40 minutes until someone came to open me the door and handover the keys.\n2) The Noise: the noise coming from the street or from the neighbours was very, very audible inside this apartment. I guess this is not something that the host can fix, but I need to leave this note for future guests.\nOn a positive note: the apartment is in a good location and, apart from the fact that does not have a washing machine, it is well equipped."},{"_id":"169730825","date":{"$date":"2017-07-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"15984115","reviewer_id":"130298312","reviewer_name":"Wim","comments":"The house and the location was good.

Wifi was available. \nDownfall is that It’s on the third floor so you’ll have to climb a few set of stairs which was hard with luggage’s. It’s beside the port rather than the beach area, but we didn’t have a problem as it was easy to drive to the beach- you could walk, about 3km. The area on the weekend is quite busy so it gets loud, especially with the thin walls you can hear the neighbors very easily. \nParking was on the streets so you had to drive around a bit to find a spot some times.

This particular area, however, is not super walkable (like much of Kaua'i). It's one of those strip-mall-style areas that's built for cars and doesn't even have sidewalks. The beach is behind an unattractive concrete wall, and is not amenable to swimming or snorkeling. The place itself is beautiful: Nice layout, very comfortable, and stylish. The laundry is at the end of the hall, accessible w/ your keycard. The check-in office is incorrectly located on (Hidden by Airbnb) maps (I just submitted a change, so it may be successful by the time you read this): the building is actually near the end of Aleka Loop, not the middle. The apartment buildings are organized by letter (GHI, DEF, etc.).

It is a 5-10 minute walk to the nicer beaches, a little further than we expected but quite acceptable.   The beaches locally have a lot of wave action, so don't expect to snorkel.\n\nTraffic in and out of the Kapaa area (particularly going south) was pretty heavy in the late afternoon/early evening.

So, if you want your bedroom cool, use the 2 fans that Nicky provides. \n- It's better to park your car and leave it at Nicky's to roam the city by foot or transit. The traffic is pretty heavy and it's hard to find parking in Montreal. You'll actually be faster and less stressed on foot or transit."},{"_id":"186117024","date":{"$date":"2017-08-23T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16002924","reviewer_id":"22002139","reviewer_name":"Nancy","comments":"Great location.

Being four blocks from Saint Catherine Street, and three blocks from Grey Nuns, which is where my son has his dorm while he is at Concordia was perfect. The kitchen is really quite handsome and everything was sparkling clean. \n\nThe master bed was much more comfortable than I was expecting. We didn’t use the second room so I can’t say how that bed is but if it’s anything like the first one, you’ll be happy.

It was the perfect location -- a nice stroll to Old Montreal, to the heart of the downtown area and to the Bell Centre where we took in a concert. The walk to the Bell Centre is no more than 10-minutes -- perfectly conveninent for our needs. Nicky's place is great. Communication and check-in was an excellent experience -- easy and fast. The apartment was spotless and the kitchen well-appointed with everything one requires to prepare meals. The air conditioning was a blessing, particularly the one in the bedroom, which made for comfortable sleeping. The patio was also a nice feature. Overall, we very much enjoyed our stay at Nicky's place and would certainly stay there again!

Also parking which is a HUGE savings. Very attentive if you have questions.
