The apartment units were definitely built on the cheap. While the balcony is okay, it faces the parking lot and makes for a lousy view. It is the interior of the apartment, however, that made us miserable. WiFi is spotty. The bed is funky for two people; one will have to climb over the other to get out. There is no place to hang towels in the bathroom save for a small hook draped over the  door. There is nowhere to place soap or shampoo in the shower stall but the floor. The wall fixture holding the shower head is loose, meaning that the slightest amount of water pressure makes the shower hose wriggle around like a snake. The water pressure in the super-small bathroom sink is inconsistent. Prepare for your shower to turn cold, as the  water heater seems to go on and off. Porto is AMAZING. It is unfortunate that this apartment, lacking any of its charm, detracted from our enjoyment of the city.\n"},{"_id":"296732072","date":{"$date":"2018-07-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"23684385","reviewer_id":"68488314","reviewer_name":"Erika","comments":"The location and the apartment was great.

Montreal is an amazing city and everything is easily accessible from this location. I will book again with her in the very near future! The best part was that this apartment was sparkling clean, animal and smoke free, something that was a must for my as I have allergies.\n\nAlexia went out of her way to communicate with me and allow an early check in. She held my bag in her own apartment at check out so that I could hang out in the city until my later flight and even put the bag in her cabinet so that her adorable kitty Igor could not get hairs on it as I am allergic.\n\nIn the apartment there was coffee and tea for guests to enjoy. She has a helpful booklet of how everything works and what is nice in the neighborhood to explore. She provides hand knitted slippers for guests to wear! The apartment is perfect for one person or a couple with plenty of towels, a hair dryer, extra blankets, a tub for soaking and a full kitchen. There is even a balcony and if it wasn't November and freezing outside I would have taken Alexia up on having my tea out there! \n\nThe apartment is a few blocks away from the most incredible park, Mount Royal, and even though it was chilly I went in to walk in the woods everyday. The charming Plateau and Mile End neighborhoods are also right outside the door. It is a quick walk to downtown or a practically instant bus ride on the 55. I particularly enjoyed a gluten free bakery called Boulangerie Baked2Go Allergen Free, the adorable Edmond cafe canteen, and a health food store all within a couple of blocks. Lots of vintage shops on the main drag close by, St Laurent. It was a ten minute walk to Parc La Fontaine and the best poutine that was also able to be gluten free at a super cute cafe La Banquise. This was my first trip to Montreal and I could not have asked for a better host or apartment. I felt like a native coming home to the charming plant filled foyer. What a wonderful city!\n\nI had such a great trip visiting the Manifesto exhibit at MAC, a film festival was going on and I was able to catch a French language movie,  I got a new tattoo at the close by at Minuit Dix Tattoo from outstanding artist Charline Bataille and bought a hand made winter coat at the incredible Kanuk store down the road that had a 50% off sale. A magical first trip thanks to Alexia's charming apartment and it's wonderful location!"},{"_id":"350821284","date":{"$date":"2018-11-20T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"23688192","reviewer_id":"5637823","reviewer_name":"Pauline","comments":"Appartement très propre et très bien situé!

Lots of windows to enjoy natural lighting and air breeze. Located right in middle of Central with lots of convenient stores, restaurants, bars, coffee shops nearby, making basic living needs easy. Although even after midnight you could still inevitably hear the voice of the crowd from bars downstairs, but that’s the characteristic of Central, I don’t dislike it.  Transporting is somewhat convenient, if not by taxi, the uphill foot travel from subway allows you to enjoy the street arts along the way. Though it says the unit is four stairs up but in reality it’s nearly six floors high, which was alright for me, just caught me by surprise. \n\nMatt replied to messages promptly and also provided well covered check-in info, along with a map of recommended restaurants nearby. I randomly picked a brunch place from it one day when I was too lazy to look up lunch in HK, and I absolutely loved it!❤️"},{"_id":"251403194","date":{"$date":"2018-04-08T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"23720900","reviewer_id":"2286261","reviewer_name":"Dan","comments":"Our stay with Mats was excellent and exceeded our expectations.

May not be good for some people, but gotta work off all that food somehow.\n\nIt may seem a little far away from the Central MTR station, but the Mid-level escalators make it very easy to get up and down and are fun to use.

They gave us a lot of good recommendations, many of which we utilized, and they were very nice in giving us an explanation of the city.  The location couldn't be better.  The house itself is quiet and secluded, but you walk out the front gate and you are right in the heart of the nightlife.  The house was great and we kept commenting on how cool the decoration was and how comfortable.  We had everything we needed once in the house and in the end we felt we needed more time to explore Oporto.

The map Rui sent to me prior to us arriving was great we easily found our way from the Trinidade Metro station to the Back to Back House. \r\n\r\nOur welcome was great too - the house was spotlessly clean, comfortable with everything on hand you could ask for.\r\n\r\nAll in all we had a very special trip to Porto to celebrate or Dad's 70th birthday.\r\n\r\nWe would all consider visiting Porto again in the future and possibly staying at the Back-to-Back House II"},{"_id":"101521269","date":{"$date":"2016-09-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2373963","reviewer_id":"64671234","reviewer_name":"Vladimir","comments":"We only stayed for one night but it was great.

Would definitely recommend this place!"},{"_id":"270791378","date":{"$date":"2018-05-30T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"23743781","reviewer_id":"167852839","reviewer_name":"Jaime","comments":"Loved it, loved it. The apartment was, overall amazing. Underground parking was very safe.The elevator right beside the unit made it easy to offload and load up our van with all our luggage. 6 people had a lot of luggage. An extra set of keys would have been really nice. The WIFI really only worked on the main level. It barely worked if at all, upstairs. Perhaps the modem should be relocated. Also, it was hard to sleep at night because of the neighbour's dogs on the property east of us barking pretty much all night. Perhaps not much can be done about that but, I have to mention it as it was very intrusive. \nThe apartment itself is beautiful and as promised. The views of the ocean from the balconies are amazing. There are several restaurants, bars and grocery shopping close by. \nOne thing is for sure, even with the dog issue we would have loved to have stayed longer at this apartment. By the way, use WAZE to find it.

The location was excellent,  we were about a 5 minute walk to the Notre Dame Basilica. The building is clean, and quiet. We had access to the gym which we used. The parking space was a bit small, and uncomfortable, but we were glad to have it. The only almost catastrophic thing that happened was that when we got there 2 beds were missing which were advertised in the  original post. We contacted Julia and Philly right away, and they said that they could drop one off the following day and that the 2 sofa beds could fit 2 people each, so we should have enough room. That would have been horrible and uncomfortable for all of us considering we had a 6+ feet tall guy who barely fit by himself on the sofa bed, and couldn’t share the  queen size bed in the bedroom. In the end it all worked out because one of our coworkers did not come.

The furniture, finishes, and decorations are similar, but the physical room is not the one as shown.  Not a huge issue as the actual unit was quite sizeable and the layout didn't impose.  Just to note, the listing indicates for 6 guests.  At most it could comfortably sleep 4 adults.  Two in the queen bed and 1 in each of the two sofa beds.  So just beware of that if you have a larger group.  Also the sofa beds were quite firm/hard, like sleeping on a camping foam matress."},{"_id":"327968310","date":{"$date":"2018-09-24T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"23749673","reviewer_id":"173081013","reviewer_name":"Jesika","comments":"The worst communication with owner of the apartment.

There is even a rooftop terrace for dining. So many great things. The one drawback is that the listing says there is air conditioning and it worked so poorly, I don't think you should count on that. It was very hot in Montreal the weekend we went and we just couldn't get the house cool with the air conditioner. Other than that, everything was great and I highly recommend this home!"},{"_id":"299247958","date":{"$date":"2018-07-30T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"23769045","reviewer_id":"123764713","reviewer_name":"Mélanie","comments":"L’appartement est très bien équipé et surtout la terrasse sur le toit est magnifique!

Caused my roommate to sneeze throughout the night.\n3) Communications with the host regarding the flooding situation became oddly defensive. I ended up having to placate him as he got very angry when I told him that the situation did not meet our expectations for the stay and to please look into the matter immediately (day 2/3)\n4) Building entrance doors weren't ever locked. Anyone could walk in off the street - not sure if that's the norm in Montreal for rental/ primarily AirBNB buildings but as two women staying by ourselves, it made us uncomfortable. Not really the hosts' fault of course, but we should have been informed.\n5) When he let himself and/or the building maintenance crew into the apartment to investigate (while we were out for the day), we returned several hours later to find that they had left the apartment unlocked. All our stuff was in the apartment, including my roommate's passport, laptop, jewelry, etc. This combined with the fact that the building has zero security at the entrance made us very uncomfortable and we felt it was very inappropriate that the host did not ensure that he locked the apartment door upon his leaving. It was sheer luck that no one thought to try to walk in and help themselves to anything. \n"},{"_id":"299219860","date":{"$date":"2018-07-30T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"23771506","reviewer_id":"34468469","reviewer_name":"Greg","comments":"Stéphane was extremely responsive and communicative."},{"_id":"303506022","date":{"$date":"2018-08-07T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"23771506","reviewer_id":"4133177","reviewer_name":"Jason","comments":"The host was great at communicating and really quick in his responses.

Not right in the center of old town  to be overwhelming but just a couple blocks away to be very convenient.  It’s right around the corner from Notre-Dame Basilica and about a block from the Metro.  We used all public transportation during our stay and it was very easy to earn the subway/bus lines.  The apt has everything you need for cooking, TV works fine with several cable channels and WiFi was good.  Our host was communicative and was accommodating with a request we made and we were thankful for that.  Highly recommend Tommy cafe up the street for coffee and breakfast.

For those who are going to use the indoor parking, it would be wise to park at the end of the 15 min parking for the embassy suites because you will have to go up to the apt to get the parking pass and drive around one way streets to get to the parking garage. If you park at the 15 min zone, you can probably just back up 10 ft to get to the garage. There is an entrance to the indoor connected montreal across the street and you can walk all the way to the eaton centre in about 25 minutes or the place des artes in about 15 minutes.

Everything you need is there. WiFi is working great. Nalan is very reachable and eager to help out if you have any questions. If there is one thing for improvement it’s the lighting situation, but every Turkish home I’ve stayed in has had the same: not many side lamps. I used the balcony a lot, it’s a nice place to feel you’re in the city. Next door is an excellent dürüm shop and all the treats of Kadiköy are within walking distance. In 10 minutes you walk to the Bosporus public transport to European side. Loved to stay here and hope to come back some time!"},{"_id":"342630511","date":{"$date":"2018-10-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"23788201","reviewer_id":"220531909","reviewer_name":"Nicolas","comments":"Great flat in a great location, own by a great owner!!"},{"_id":"347243479","date":{"$date":"2018-11-11T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"23788201","reviewer_id":"20997176","reviewer_name":"Madhia","comments":"Great location. \nPlenty of bars, restaurants and coffee shops.\nDurum Place next door"},{"_id":"349028092","date":{"$date":"2018-11-16T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"23788201","reviewer_id":"9860832","reviewer_name":"Grace + David","comments":"Nalan's place is what airbnb should be.

Our stay at Nalan's apartment must be one of those special  moments. You arrive to a foreign land and city, where you never have been before. After an excruciating journey with an dishonest taxidriver from the wrong airport, you arrive at somebody else's home, and greeted with a warm welcome. After a short introduction where to sleep, and where to hang your your clothes, you are left alone in somebody else's nice and shiny clean apartment. Really a big wow type experience. And it is of course the very basic Airbnb, to tactfully and with great respect of other people's belongings stay in another person's apartment. What more is there to say? Of course the apartment was well cleaned, in very good condition, with all the necessary tings to cook, fry, iron, wash and so on.\nWe slept very well, and the whole area is full of shops, restaurants, bars and so on, all very closely together and in an small area easily reached by walking.\nTo visit Istanbul from Nalan's apartment is very simple,  you have the boats close by, going to most parts of the town. Going to Taksim square? Easy - take the boat to Kabatas, when there take the Metro one stop, and you are there. Grand Bazaar? Again easy, boat to Karaköy, cange to tram going over the bridge you just went under, get off at Beyazit stop. Get a Istanbul card, works at trams,  boats, metro and busses. Thank you Nalan for letting us use your apartment,  we had a wonderful stay, and we warmly recommend her apartment to anyone visiting Istanbul."}]}

Most restaurants and shops close, or are winding down at 9pm - 9.30pm so an earlier dinner/shopping is recommended to avoid disappointment.","notes":"This is our first year so until we get familiar with the working of the website our long time friend has agreed to take care of our bookings through the AirBNB website.

A rental car is recommended from the airport so you can drive back to the airport for your departure. Most of the major Car Rental Companies are at the airport with a shuttle service to the Car Rental from curb-side at the Airport.

There is an entrance/exit front door through the banana grove and an entrance/exit lanai door to the lawn and relaxing cool pool which is just 20 feet away! You will be able to enjoy the whole condo without intrusion as there is no daily housekeeping on site, therefore we supply all our own personal towels and bedding for the duration of your stay! For hygiene reasons we do not supply beach toys, snorkels or fins.  We ask that you also please keep the screen doors closed at all times to prevent insects entering.   When cooking we would appreciate you opening the front and lanai doors but keeping screen doors closed.  This helps to keep the unit ventilated.

This charming unit is very clean, cozy, comfortable, and short stroll to downtown beachfront. \nThere’s a gate from the complex that leads directly to Ali’i Dr, where all the shops, cafes and restaurants are. I love how central the location is and within 5minutes I’m at the beach for a swim, or getting a massage right across the street (Theresa is amazing at Ka Lima Hana Kukui!)   The farmers market is also next door on Wed/Thurs, where you can buy fresh fruit and coffee to take back home! There is a coffee pot with filters so you can brew your very own Kona coffee to enjoy every morning! \n\nThere’s also a patio outside with relaxing and quaint poolside/garden views. All the towels and linens very clean and fresh, the bed was plush, cozy and very comfortable- a real “home away from home.” There is a nice AC in the unit so you feel refreshed after the hot tropical weather! My friend came over to enjoy it as well, as where she was staying, her place did not have AC- it makes a big difference! \n\nThe hot shower/water pressure is also great in the unit and replenished me after several days of scuba diving trips. I went with Jack’s Diving Locker in the complex next door (super convenient and their charter is one of the best on the island- check out their reviews on Yelp) The first evening we ate at Huggo’s just a short stroll by the waterfront. Delicious food, beautiful view and great service! \n\nI received a very warm, courteous and clear communication from Jeanette, with very easy check-in and out. I could not have asked for a better, more comfortable location to stay in Kona! I’ll definitely come back and stay again! Mahalo!

As an asthmatic I was nervous. Jeanette (property manager) eased my mind with some government links that list air quality. Which was an easy comparison to Los Angeles at the time. My plan was to go forward with my vacation and bring my nebulizer. I’m happy to report that I never needed it! Even traveling the entire island, I was fine! \n\nCheck in was easy! The front desk answered all my questions without problems. Along with how to get to the pool area and laundry room. Immediately we noticed that the grounds, landscaping were well kept and clean. We loved the sign for the feral-tame cats outside too. They were so friendly to see on my early morning runs. \n\nWhat was a surprise was how well stocked the condo was for our visit. From Saran Wrap, coffee filters, grocery bag in the closet, cooler for drinks, extra towels for the pool and the 3 pillows each were nice too! We were worried about the smaller bed as we’re used to a king size at home. The mattress pad and pillows were clean and comfortable! One day I wanted a nap to stretch out,  I used the rollaway bed in the couch. It was great! Everything was so clean! The added surprise snacks were a thoughtful touch and special treat too! It made us both smile! \n\nThe central location to the touristy stuff was fun to see at night. I enjoyed the people watching and the close sea wall. Yet the drives we took to Hilo to see the waterfalls, along with seeing Mauna Kea-the surprising wild goats were awesome, driving across the lava land gave us awesome pictures to get to Kekaha state park, seeing the painted church, visiting black sand beach, and my favorite was swimming-snorkeling literally with the turtles. Which I did right down the street at the iron man swim spot at Kailua-Kona bay! Just walking right from Edna’s place! \n\nAs an airline agent in the travel industry for almost 12 years, I always looked at Hawaii as being overrated. I was wrong. I get it and I will be back. The big Island is breathtakingly beautiful. This condo added to our view of this special place. We will be back and hopefully at our new home away from home at Edna’s.

We enjoyed sitting outside, overlooking the pool with a sundowner and a swim and spa at the end of a busy day exploring the Island. (Check out the Octopus farm, Kona coffee farm, kayaking to the James Cook memorial and swimming with spinner dolphins and Manta Rays with Wicked Wahine). We had a ball and will be back to explore the Volcano National Park which reopened the day we left."}]}

Windy conditions were intolerable--nothing ever quietened in the house the first night.  Noisy AC units in the 2 bedrooms, so they could not be run at night to cool down the house temperature.  No AC in the main room or kitchen which resulted in 85+ deg F temps and uncomfortable stuffiness.\nLots of noise throughout the night and day from military activities--sounded like low-flying helicopters; also, could constantly hear neighbors--must have been very thin walls in all the closely spaced homes.\nLots of animal noises as well--could not figure out all the different noises, but sometimes we felt like we were on a farm.\nBlinds were loosely woven reeds/thin bamboo and yielded zero privacy (they were effectively transparent)--neighbors could see clearly into every room in the home.  Also, the home was very bright inside starting at 5:00 AM, so trying to sleep in was impossible.\nWe walked on the beach, which was 50 - 75 yards or so from the home, but it was not a beach for lounging on a towel or chair--steep slope, rough sand conditions.  But very nice ocean waters and great scenery.\nLots of mold residue throughout bathroom; shower pan /floor tile stained black, brown, orange, rust, etc.--very difficult to tell if the shower had been cleaned.  My wife did not want to use the shower.\nLots of ants and other bugs (large roaches)  in the kitchen.  Again, made us question the overall cleanliness and pest control measures.\nFloors appeared to have been vacuumed, but not cleaned.  Custom is to remove shoes (which we wholeheartedly agree with and observe in our own home), but after one night of walking around in my socks, the bottoms of my gray socks were chocolate brown.\nWe contacted AirBnB directly and tried to cancel our 8 night stay after 1 night.  Unfortunately, we were not able to find other accommodations and had to stay a 2nd night (which we managed to do), and then moved to a hotel in the near vicinity.\nWe paid for 3 nights in this home, which seemed reasonable given we were the ones who chose to cancel."},{"_id":"276126837","date":{"$date":"2018-06-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"23839051","reviewer_id":"63117363","reviewer_name":"Cindy","comments":"No comment"},{"_id":"283405891","date":{"$date":"2018-06-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"23839051","reviewer_id":"188595274","reviewer_name":"Pauline","comments":"Our goal was to be able to view incoming ships for RIMPAC and this was a great location for that.

In. This. Place.\n\nI'm going to recommend this place to many many people, so book it up fast!\n\nThis was my favorite Airbnb stay in a while, and I've stayed in many many Airbnbs. Berndt and Dan were exceptional hosts and their home is one of the most beautiful on the Big Island, I'm sure of it. Do yourself a favor and ask them all about how they came to run a chocolate farm in Hawaii - their life stories are fascinating and I would quite happily have chatted their ear off for hours. Meeting them was an absolute joy.\n\nThe farm is lovely - with a stream, interesting fruits and spices, as well as the chocolate plants, and even a treehouse that they used to live in while they were designing and building the house. The chocolate farm is just getting up and running but we gratefully sampled chocolates left at the side of our bed and smell the beans roasting in their workroom\n\nThe sea view room has a huge window that you can leave open without blinds and watch the stars. It has a private entrance and private en-suite so it's definitely more of a guest suite than a private room. You also have access to a kitchen which they use for chocolate prep. Everything is very well designed and stylish, with high end features that shout to Dan's artistic profession.\n\nThey even left us fresh papaya and avocados just picked from the garden for breakfast - which were so huge we couldn't possibly eat all of. \n\nHilo is much closer than we thought, as are waterfalls, hikes and snorkelling spots. Just ask Berndt or Dan for recommendations - they are big advocates for the responsible tourism and enjoyment of the local area. \n\nMahalo for the stay!"},{"_id":"363021980","date":{"$date":"2018-12-27T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"23926355","reviewer_id":"116628982","reviewer_name":"Gabrielle","comments":"I was not to visit the Big Island in the first place.

We love everything about the experience. Book the stay as soon as you can before this place gets too popular. Here is a quick summary of what we like about this place:  \n1. super new\u0026clean room with ocean-view: while we were looking for a place to stay that is close to Hilo, a lot of the hotels seen old and some Airbnbs look too remote (no bathroom attached). The cacao room really stood out as the room itself is excellent with oceanview. Already missed the feeling of waking up by the morning bird songs and enjoy the sunrise from the cacao room.\n\n2. Modern design farmhouse: The building is a piece of art. It is so interesting to hear the story of constructing the building from Dan and saw the amazing blue lighting while driving back to the farm in the night. \n\n3. The host Dan is friendly and thoughtful: Dan welcomed us to his place with a small bite of chocolate (of course, we are staying on a chocolate farm).  We are amazed by all his small but thoughtful surprises: champaign in the fridge (we are celebrating 2 year anniversary), some fruit juice and experimental chocolate flavor popcorn. \n   \n4. Chocolate farm tasting experience: we decided to go on his chocolate farm tasting tour. It was great to learn about how chocolate is made, walked around the property, and tasting some delicious chocolate. There are a cool tree house, a swinging bridge, and a river right on the property.

Very helpful tips on restaurants, activities.  \nThe setting is stunning:  a cacao farm on a rushing river.  Dramatic beauty is everywhere (including an 7 foot tall heliconia arrangement in our room cut fresh from the garden!).  At night, the tropical critters sing their songs, providing a sweet lullaby.   We look forward to returning someday."}]}

It was a real pleasure to come back to the chilled and comfortable rooms (great AC), the western-stylish bathroom (bathtub and hot water all day long) and the well-equiped kitchen/appartment. Internet works great too. You also get a comfortable place on the rooftop to chill out after a long day. The buidling is a bit old (some facility noises) but the neighbours are mostly discrete and friendly. The neighbourhood is also great and more quiet then the famous parts. If you exit the MTR at exit A you'll find the more lively part of the neighbourhood. Brend was also answering within 15 minutes and very friendly. A great, comfortable and accessible place. Thanks again."},{"_id":"254217745","date":{"$date":"2018-04-16T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2393133","reviewer_id":"94113933","reviewer_name":"La","comments":"Great location! Cozy place! Clean!

He was always very prompt with his replies to my questions, and he had a number of great suggestions of places to see, etc.  His flat is a terrific bargain for staying on Hong Kong Island, and I base this on the fact that I have been coming to Hong Kong at least twice a year over the last five years. The photos of the flat are reasonably accurate, and the flat was very clean and well equipped. There is more than enough kitchen stuff to make meals if you wish. A friend and I stayed with Brend because we were attending a marine biology conference at the University of Hong Kong, and the flat is SUPER convenient to the University of Hong Kong (very close to the university’s east gate).  It is also a short walk to the MTR island line, so it is easy to get anywhere. There are also lots of restaurants and markets and even a great bakery nearby.  I would certainly stay there again and Brend’s flat would be my first choice if anyone asked for a recommendation of where to stay while visiting Hong Kong."},{"_id":"404165953","date":{"$date":"2019-01-23T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2393133","reviewer_id":"70497675","reviewer_name":"Reed","comments":"Brend's place is terrific - sparkling clean and terrific location close to MTR, buses, lots of taxis, and a number of great little cafes and bistros just up the street.

We wanted a place that we could use as a base for exploring the north/east sides of Maui. The neighborhood was super quiet at night and though there are 4 condo's in Floyd's place I never heard any of the neighbors and they were all occupied. Floyd state there's a surcharge for leaving the AC/fans on when you leave so we turned things off during the day. The condo was always really hot when we returned but it cooled down pretty quickly, especially the front room where the AC unit is. The Netflix and internet worked great.

We drove around the entire island and picked a new beach every day. We used Floyd's good quality snorkeling gear and had a lot of fun swimming with turtles and fish.

He was eager and proactive to assist with answering any questions that I had and if he didn’t know he tried to point me to the best resource. The place was very clean overall and it almost felt like a hotel, but in the country side. It’s an excellent spot near the best bakery and breakfast place in town that he recommended called Baked on Maui, Haleakalā National Park, Paia, and Makawao.

If I could give 10 stars I would. Super nice hosts who truly care about their guests and property. The homes location is perfect due to the elevation (1500 ft) keeping the hotter temperatures down below in Kona. The description notes its above the Kona airport so I was a little worried about plane noise - never heard one plane! I could see them on occasion but the noise is definitely NOT a factor. Watching the sunset, the tropical flora all around with soothing bird songs in the morning and cute frogs sounds at night that sing you to sleep. Its very private  with all the comforts of home, including a really nice Samsung TV and Spectrum internet. Wi-Fi was fast as well - I had no slow issues at all, which I sorta of thought could be a problem due to the location but it wasn't at all. Things like beach chairs, beach towels, snorkel gear, sunscreen were a thoughtful addition. Think there was even a beach umbrella! Travelers are all set here. The full size kitchen was a huge bonus too... along with a grill on the lanai. This place truly had everything...great value all around. On top of everything else, the home is super clean! I'm a bit of a clean freak so having everything clean and comfortable space is important to me. One last thing that I want to mention is the bedding - all super soft and luxurious.

I especially loved sitting out on the porch in the morning drinking my coffee and enjoying the amazing view.

Also, I never saw roaches or ants, and I stayed for 15 nights—I just can’t live with bugs, even in Hawaii! There are a lot of geckos around, but they eat mosquitoes and other small bugs, so it’s a trade off.

Her unit was smaller than I expect but it was good for my boyfriend and I. The unit has a balcony with a table and two chairs. We enjoyed drinking yummy coffee and tea (provided by Joyce) out in the balcony. It was so nice to have sunset view of the ocean. The property is surrounded with beautiful greenery too. The kitchen has everything you need to cook, make tea, coffee and keep food cooled. She provided many things such as spices, creamer, coffee, tea, honey, sugar, wine and some snacks. She was also very generous and gave us some fresh fish fillets. One of the days her and Randy made Poke and we got to try it. She was so nice and brought some up for us to try. The fridge did give us some trouble one of the days but the issue was resolved the next day. The bedroom had comfortable silk sheets. The mattress was okay, I like firm but this was firmer than what I like. I still slept fine though.  The closet had many hangers which I used. Bathroom was nice and had amazing luxury towels. We did encounter ants twice while we there. I’m not sure why they were coming out from bathroom mirror but the area was sprayed twice. This resolved the issue. The weather was perfect mid 80s during the day. Although the weather wasn’t as hot the unit does get warm. We opened all windows and doors  and still was hot during the day. There is one window fan she provides but it only helps at night. We spend most of the days doing day time activities so we weren’t in the unit that much when it was hot. At night the view of the stars is amazing. We did go snorkeling with the gear provided and it was so much fun. Randy suggested two step beach. Must try!  Overall it was great experience.

Such an amazing place with all the amenities of home.  Whatever you may need during your stay, Joyce has thought of and provided it.  One of our special nights there was spent grilling steak and fresh pineapple at the ohana and watching the sunset.  Joyce has all the spices and cooking essentials right there in the kitchen to make this possible.  And, the sunset view was amazing!  The decor was so beautiful and everything was clean and sparkling.  It was nice having boogie boards, snorkeling gear, beach towels, an umbrella and chairs available to hit the beach whenever we wanted.  The cooler and ice packs that Joyce provided made it easy to transport snacks/water during our daily outings.  Also, it came in handy to bring things back to the ohana that we purchased from the local markets.  Joyce's tips for things to see and do were so helpful!  This was our first trip to Hawaii and with Joyce's insight we were able to plan our days and make the most out of our stay.  Also, we used her restaurant suggestions and they were much appreciated.  Another perk was having a washer and dryer available to use when we needed to do a little laundry.  Not only was this our first trip to Hawaii but our first experience with Airbnb.  And, we can't express how perfect everything turned out - thanks to Joyce.

I decided to fly into Kailua-Kona on Thanksgiving Day.  Prior to my arrival, Joyce reached out to invite me to dinner.  Due to my late arrival, I was unable to attend but was pleasantly surprised to find dinner waiting for me once I made it in.  Thank you for being so kind!!\n First, I have to say that my stay in Joyce and Randy’s home exceeded all my expectations.  The apartment was beautiful both inside and out.  Lush green foliage, ocean views and the quiet evening breeze provided the perfect setting to watch the sunset and/or sunrise.  The inside was tastefully decorated, clean and comfortable.  I could tell that Joyce put a considerable amount of time and effort into choosing the furniture, accessories, color scheme.  Very detail oriented!  Everything that I could have possibly needed was there.  Aside from linen, towels, dishes, etc., there were also beach chairs, beach towels, fins, a cooler with ice packs, a grill, cable, Wi-Fi, laundry facility, and last but certainly not least a lanai with a table/chairs.  They even provided seasonings and filtered water. The only thing that I needed to do was pick up groceries.  It was too easy!!  Getting around the island was easy too.  I enjoyed the fact knowing that once I reached the end of the street I had “options”.  If I made a left onto 190, I was off to explore various parts of the island –Kohala, Honokaa or Hilo to name a few. A quick turn to the right and I was off down the hill to the beach, shopping and restaurants.  Simply put…if I wanted a quick walk on the beach, shop and/or eat lunch by the water…turn right.  If I wanted to explore the island, left was the way to go.  After consulting the tour book also found in the apartment, and talking to Joyce about the various options, I decided to turn left.  I was rewarded with a spectacular drive over to Waimea and ultimately to the Hawaii Tropical Botanical Garden near Hilo.  Note:   If you happen to be a veteran, there are discounts to be had.  I was admitted free of charge just by showing my id.   I loved everything about my trip.  In the end, I would say that the hardest decision that you’ll make will be whether you stay in to enjoy the apartment or venture out.

Walking distance to iconic food destinations like Fairmount bagel, Schwartz's Delicatessen, Wilensky and more, about a 5-7 min. walk to the metro. We visited during extremely hot weather so we were glad to have this place to come back to and relax during the day to recharge -- the AC helped a ton. The flat and kitchen is impeccably stocked with any tools and things you might need -- we chose to grill some of our meals with the awesome Weber grill on the roof deck.\n\nI was also very impressed by the cleanliness and presentation of the flat overall.

Einziger Nachteil ist, dass die Wohnung im 4en Stock ohne Lift ist. Für uns kein Problem, aber vielleicht für ältere oder schwächere. \nTOP-Appartement!!!\n\nTIPP was nicht zur Wohnungsbeurteilung gehört: \nDie Portwein-Keller sind in unmittelbarer Umgebung, wobei wir Taylors für eine Besichtigung empfehlen. Da kann man selber eine Tour mit Audioerklärungen in jeder Sprache im eigenen Tempo begehen. Einkaufen in den Kellern, speziell bei Calem ist nicht zu empfehlen. Wegen vielen Touristen sind die Preise dort jeweils erhöht. Mussten wegen Unkenntnis, bei Calem für eine Vintage-Port, den ich zum ersten mal kosten wollte, 220% mehr bezahlen als auf seriösen Homepages nachgelesen. Zudem verkauften sie mir einen der schlechtesten Jahrgänge, obwohl ich mich extra, wegen Unwissenheit, beraten lies. Wurde gut ausgenutzt. Auch normale Portweine kosten ca. 10 bis 20% mehr als in den umliegenden Geschäften oder Online.

Checkin process went easy, we were provided with a huge list of recommendations about the places to see, to eat etc.\nThe duplex is perfectly located (especially for people who adore porto wine). The area is beautiful, but not really touristic. \nThe flat has everything you need for a comfortable stay. And a FANTASTIC terrace. Last 2 evenings we did not go to the restaurants but ate on the terrace - the view and the atmosphere there is much better :)\nI would recommend this place to couples who want to spend a romantic time in Porto (or Vila Nova de Gaia :)).\nBut I would not recommend to bring huge suitcases - it's less than 1 km from the metro, but the road is not flat at all. And we did't manage to call the Uber there (had to use Teleférico to get up to the metro station with our luggage).

Además tienes las bodegas con sus terrazas y restaurantes al lado.

En condiciones normales, que también tuvimos, las temperaturas son moderadas y muy agradables en verano en general  y también en el apartamento.

La casa es igual que en las fotos, la limpieza impecable, todo muy nuevo... y encima con vistas al puente D. Luis. Posiblemente leas que cualquier emplazamiento es centrico, aqui te queda la primera estación de metro a 10 minutos caminando y la estación de tren de Sao Bento a 20 minutos, puede parecer mucho, pero no lo es. Oporto es una ciudad tranquila pero con mucho movimiento de turístas, hospedarte más al centro supone mucho más ruido, y sobre todo, porque muchas de sus calles son con adoquines, por lo que se  puede percibir el ruido desde muy temprano, en la casa de Maria, lo único que te puede despertar es alguna gaviota que se acerque mucho a la terraza. \n\nDesde el primer día nos facilitaron información de diferentes lugares para visitar y comer, aunque nosotros ya conocíamos Oporto. Puedes contratar un transfer para que te lleve desde el aeropuerto por unos 15 euros para 2 personas.\n\nNos ha encantado Oporto y el resto de ciudades que visitamos, ya que practicamente todo los hicimos en tren que es muy barato.

В квартире две комнаты, салон и большая кухня. 15 минут хотьбы от пляжа, на пляже есть тропинка, которая ведет в соседние города. Отлично так пройтись или пробежаться по ней!

Joe is a nice host, however, there were some factors that other guests should be aware of.\n\nFirstly, we expected to be alone in the apartment since the description said 'entire flat' but the host is present at night and in the morning. He's not around in the afternoon and evening though. The two bedrooms were spacious and joe lent us towels. Additionally, the description mentioned that there would be AC but there was not and the rooms were pretty hot. \n\nSecondly, Porto is about 30 minutes away via train but trains aren't very frequent. It's about 10 mins to walk from the apartment to the train station. Joe lent us train cards for our stay. \n\nThe neighbourhood is quite noisy at night with dogs barking, so we'd recommend bringing earplugs if you get easily woken up."},{"_id":"302874702","date":{"$date":"2018-08-06T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"24041662","reviewer_id":"85053019","reviewer_name":"Hans","comments":"The room was good."},{"_id":"306101065","date":{"$date":"2018-08-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"24041662","reviewer_id":"207731542","reviewer_name":"Wilson","comments":"O preço é um pouco elevado.

Walking distance from anywhere. The station exit D2 is literally 1min walk from the apartment. The place is surrounded by huge malls and many restaurants and food. The airport shuttle bus is 10mins walk away and from my experience you don't really need any taxi's there either go underground or walk! Previously reading other people's reviews about the lift to the apartment... It's not as bad as people are saying! These lifts have an maintenance contract and are maintained... We had no issues going up or down. I'd definitely be back to this apartment and will recommend it to my friend's and family. Just to summarise the apartment has a single bedroom with a bunk bed and a double room with 2x king size beds. There is one shower/toilet which could be a pain between a large group! And then there is a large living room with huge sofa's which also turn into beds. And lastly there is an kitchen. Very modern looking compared to the ground floor entrance hall to the lift!"},{"_id":"357356839","date":{"$date":"2018-12-10T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"24066499","reviewer_id":"192675180","reviewer_name":"吉村","comments":"Nice place to stay.

Paulo drove me to the apartment and when we were driving to there he showed me some things in Porto and he explained me where everything was and how to get there. Once we were at the apartment he showed me the apartment and told me where I can find everything. After I dropped my suitcase at the apartment Paulo took me with him and helped me with the groceries and took me for lunch which was really nice as a first day there. Late in the afternoon when I got back at the apartment. \nThe apartment was very clean and the beds also already were made. There even was coffee already for the espresso machine so I didn’t have to buy it myself! What also was nice of the apartment is that it’s really close to the metro which will bring you very fast to Porto.\n In the two weeks I stayed in Porto I've seen Paulo several times. His hospitality and friendliness  plus the amazing apartment really made me feel like home. After one week of staying in the apartment Paulo and Carla (his wife) even came to clean again which was very kind of them. Paulo also made sure if I had everything I needed at the apartment which I really appreciated. \nI really wish I could have stayed longer at the apartment. But in the future I will definitely come back to it. I recommend this apartment to everyone as the apartment is beautiful and the price for two weeks was really good aswell. It truly were a unforgettable two weeks for me. Thank you so much Paulo and Carla!\n"}]}

The disadvantages are several. The place definitely is not kept up. Once we were in our room we found the AC didn’t work, the shower drain wouldn’t drain and the fan was broken. The TV isn’t hooked up to any cable so you have a large television that you can’t watch. We found this all to be very disappointing.\nUpon arriving in Lan Kwai Fong at 1:00 pm we went to the meeting place in front of the Hard Rock Cafe and gave the Indonesian caretaker \nLing a call saying we had arrived and were waiting for her. She said she was eating lunch and would be there soon. After waiting with our luggage in the street Ling finally showed up 2 hours later at 3:00. We found her to be surly, arrogant and unpleasant to deal with. We most definitely will not stay there again.\n\n"},{"_id":"301821656","date":{"$date":"2018-08-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"24106738","reviewer_id":"44040063","reviewer_name":"An","comments":"Room is nice, but it's really for party people who don't sleep at night."},{"_id":"305200210","date":{"$date":"2018-08-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"24106738","reviewer_id":"79209525","reviewer_name":"Ido","comments":"nice place, a bit small. very good location for night people, a lot of bars/ pubs/ restaurants right downstairs. keep in mind that all the bars/ pubs/ restaurants are for tourists and can get expensive, you might want to walk a few blocks over and find some authentic places. not a good location for light sleepers, gets very noisy weekdays and weekends  "},{"_id":"307204468","date":{"$date":"2018-08-14T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"24106738","reviewer_id":"142317826","reviewer_name":"Justin","comments":"Ling’s place is probably the best location for those seeking a pad right in the beating heart of HK nightlife.

As others have commented, it's not for those who are light sleepers, especially on the weekend, with the party extending up until dawn and beyond, but if you're in Hong Kong to take advantage of the vibrant night life, there are few places better located on the island. My visit coincided with typhoon Mangkhut blowing past, felling trees and breaking windows, but Ling kept me updated with information coming out of the Hong Kong Observatory, ensuring I kept dry and safe. \n\nIt's worth keeping in mind that the place is pretty small though adequate by Hong Kong standards, and is great as a base for exploring, and you'll want to spend more time out and about than in the confines of the four walls.

The apartment was clean and it was great to have a kitchen, laundry, and tons of towels.  Liz would get more stars as a host, but we gave two stars because the rainy side was way rainier than we expected which made our stay in the Jungle Hut pretty disappointing.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it rained most of the time we were in Hilo (which is not at all uncommon, especially in December), so make sure you understand how different the sunny and rainy sides are on the Big Island.  Also, because of the constant rain the apartment felt, and smelled,  damp and musty.  The bed is also under an uninsulated section of awning so the rain was really loud on the roof, which made it hard to sleep.\r\n\r\nWe chose Hilo to be near the Volcanoes and to stay for less money, but we weren't in Hawaii for cool wet weather, so we ended up leaving the Jungle Hut for the Kona Coast for three days where we had perfect, sunny weather.  We regretted not spending our whole trip in Kona (or elsewhere on the sunny side) and making a day excursion to Volcanoes N.P.\r\n\r\nHilo might be your thing, just make sure it is before you book a place on the rainy side."},{"_id":"4303180","date":{"$date":"2013-04-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"24119","reviewer_id":"5364741","reviewer_name":"Wolfgang","comments":"The Hawaiin Jungle hut was a great and nice place to explore big island!

I was a single and had more room than I needed- the place could easily accommodate several more people and I'm definitely sure a couple would enjoy it.  I've gone so far as to suggest it as an away base for a friend who's staying on the Kona side on her upcoming honeymoon.  Though I didn't make much use of it, the kitchen was very well outfitted and would be great for longer stays.  On site laundry and instant hot water in the showers was greatly appreciated.  I spent one particularly rainy day mostly inside working and napping, and it was cool and dry- awesome.\r\n\r\nThe rainforest location is wonderful- I loved having all the frogs singing at night and being able to walk around the property during the day and see local wildlife.  At the same time, it's very well located. making it easy to get to Hilo, Kalapana and the lava flows/Uncle Robert's, the eastern side of the saddle road, and Volcano.

The jungle hut itself was great (and clean) - looks just like in the pictures. It does now have a stove (with a propane tank), though we didn't end up doing any cooking. The jungle sound at night is amazing, but mosquitoes do get in through the screen door and they are relentless (we ended up turning AC on instead). Take a drive to the end of Makuu st as well where you can get to the coast and watch the ocean. It is breathtaking. Overall I'd say this is a great location if you want a cottage-y vacay that is relaxed and away from everything. We were mostly in and out because we wanted to see what the island had to offer."},{"_id":"6401891","date":{"$date":"2013-08-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"24119","reviewer_id":"7487592","reviewer_name":"Konstantin","comments":"I stayed at the Jungle Hut for three nights. Actually it's more like a mini-cottage than a hut :) It has everything you need - from washer to propane stove - and is large enough to feel comfortably. Also liked the interior.\r\n\r\nAs for Liz - she's a great host. Though she didn't show up during my stay, she provided VERY detailed directions to the hut, instructions of how to use it and suggestions about what to see on the Big Island.\r\n\r\nSo, if you're looking for some home to make your base - choose this one. You'll get an excellent place to relax between your travels across the island. \r\n\r\nMahalo Liz :)"},{"_id":"6542049","date":{"$date":"2013-08-16T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"24119","reviewer_id":"5456464","reviewer_name":"Linda","comments":"The house is very cosy and the stay feels very secluded (and the outskirt of a private home development area).

It's really more of a cottage (although one attached to another unit) than anything else. There's a huge amount of room and several people could sleep comfortably and happily between the bed, couch, and futon. It was hard to tell from the pictures, but there are really 3 main areas (kitchen, foyer/bedroom area, and living room) plus a walled-off bathroom. The kitchen/bedroom/living area are a very open floor plan.\r\n\r\nLiz was a great host and sent us lots of information about day trips and activities in the Hilo and Volcano area. We didn't meet her personally, but spoke on the phone several times and got all details necessary for the stay. I would definitely recommend staying here if you're interested in exploring the east side of the big island. \r\n\r\nThe only piece of advice I would give you when staying here is to find the place in the day for the first time. It's easy to drive here once you know how to find it, but the back roads and turns in Hawaiian Paradise Park can be easier to drive in the light for the first time. You'll probably also want to refill the drinking water bottles during the day (there's a station nearby where you can do that for free, but the previous guests hadn't been as considerate when we arrived). This is really not a problem, though, and we enjoyed our stay tremendously!"},{"_id":"7033406","date":{"$date":"2013-09-04T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"24119","reviewer_id":"525671","reviewer_name":"Ram","comments":"From the first contact with the host to the last one, all interactions with the host were prompt and highly useful.

This place is perfect! And Liz was so helpful and allways reachable via eMail. Thank you Liz for making our stay so pleasant!\r\nSome facts:\r\n- Many people stay on the more touristic westshore around Kona. The Hilo-Side may be more rainy, but much more adorable to my opinion. The people, the prices (of food or gas for example) and the most beautiful Farmes- and Night-Markets. Thumbs up for the Hilo-Side!\r\n- Yes, nearly every evening you will hear the rain and the frogs and yes, both is surprisingly loud, but it was not disturbing at all. We loved it. And it was the best sleep we had since weeks. You're in the jungle there and it is beautiful!\r\n- Liz is the most helpful person I allways talked to on AirBnB. It's a shame, that we couldn't meet in person, because she was out of the country at that time. Top1-Host!!!\r\nSo much more compliments to give, so less words left.

We stayed for over two weeks and never felt that we lacked for anything. The town of Pahoa is a few miles away and is a great funky place to visit and eat. Do your food shopping at the supermarket in Keaau. It's the best one nearby although you can go to Longs drugs in Pahoa and pick up the basics.

Lots of cookware and utensils, but if you plan on preparing meals you'll need the little ingredients (oil, condiments, etc.). Definitely on the rainy side of the island, and it feels kind of damp inside - my girlfriend found this a little unpleasant but I didn't really notice.

The owner has even prepared a bottle of red wine and 3 gallons of water for us. The mattress is comfortable and sufficient for 2.

I have stayed here before - previously with my mom - and loved it so much I knew I wanted to come back. This time I brought my husband, who before our stay was even half over said he was going to be sad to be leaving our Jungle Hut. Coqui frogs to sing you to sleep, friendly geckos nearby to eat any pesky mosquitos, and when the sun goes down it's like being in a deserted jungle. So peaceful! \r\nLiz has everything you need here, from the covered parking to the cozy bed in the nook, to the kitchenette with full fridge and tiki bar table, private bathroom with tub and shower, all the amenities like soap and shampoo, and very thoughtful 'welcome' gifts to kick your stay off right and set the right mood for relaxation! (You'll love it!) The fan is helpful when it gets a bit muggy, and if needed there's an A/C unit, too.\r\nYou'll want to explore the Hilo side from here - easy, equal distance to Hilo and Volcano, and nearby Pahoa has quick shopping and a few restaurants, as does not-so-far-Keeau. (And Liz is great at giving a list of suggestions on what to see or do and where to find the locals' spots!) But as much as you want to explore the island, be sure to save time to just hunker down in the Jungle Hut and relax and enjoy the serenity!\r\nI'd love to say this is a horrible place so no one goes and I can have it all to myself anytime I manage to get back to the Big Island...I'd love to come back again soon!"},{"_id":"95399552","date":{"$date":"2016-08-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"24119","reviewer_id":"32624394","reviewer_name":"Jes","comments":"Liz did a great job of offering recommendations for great activities in the area.

I got just what I wanted. The house is on a very quiet piece of land where your company is the sound of rain, frogs and the occasional gecko. Oh and the chickens outside. Now understand that this house is a rain forest experience, and a rain forest tends to be active at night. You will not find dead silence at this location. If however you enjoy the sounds of nature then the frogs and rain on the roof will be a peaceful lullaby to rock you to sleep. \r\nThe decor lends itself to the peacefulness of the place, my favorite was the little sitting area by the stairs where if you look closely there is a strip of LED lights you can plug in to add to the ambience. I would definitely stay here again!\r\nSome tips:\r\n- Rent a vehicle that can handle some mud, the last section of road and the driveway can get pretty wet and muddy. \r\n- Remember that Hilo is very wet, every building I went in had a slight wet smell. It wasn't bad in this place but it is to be expected.\r\n- The internet connection was good enough for me to perform work remotely on the mainland and while AT\u0026T showed 1 bar on my phone it worked just well enough to text.

Literally in a jungle, we had a rental car so the road to the hut was a bit rough but totally worth it. Everything inside was as-advertised and Liz was easy to get ahold of and very responsive. One word of caution-if you are a light sleeper you'll want to have ear plugs because the jungle is pretty noisy at night. My fiancé and I are heavy sleepers so it didn't bother us, we actually thought it was pretty cool. We would definitely stay here again.

The lush green jungle ambiance outside was beautiful! Wild chickens roam the property and geckos and croaky frogs are around everywhere outside. It was a great stay, and would be back again. If you have a late flight leaving ITO airport, buy another night because it's no fun having all your stuff with you from 11am until your 9pm flight and not being able to nap and shower before your red-eye long journey home. Not far from the city of Pahōa or from Hilo. It was a great location to stay at and the Sunday Farmers market is great and local!! Also very close to Makuu Point!

Of all the places I've stayed in NYC, this was my favorite. It was IMMACULATELY clean, the bed was comfortable, and in a fantastic location. I've always been terrified of the Subway, but this forced me out of my comfort zone and in 24 hours I felt like a pro. \n\nMy only concern was after reading previous reviews, it was mentioned that the individual rooms didn't have locks. That is NOT the case now!!

Es gibt keine Klimaanlage - für uns ok, wenn man das Fenster öffnen kann (haben zuhause auch regelmäßig mal über 28°C). Leider ging das Fenster in einen Schacht, von dem aus nur noch wärmere Luft ins Zimmer kam. Der Ventilator hat bedingt geholfen. Am Ende war die Lösung offene Tür+ Ventilator ok."},{"_id":"294809712","date":{"$date":"2018-07-22T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"24208472","reviewer_id":"188406637","reviewer_name":"Kim","comments":"Great place, close to the subway (G line) and very affordable.

The bed was fine, bathroom clean. Check in was easy, but we didn't see anyone else than other guests, that said it didn't bother us. Luckily there was a cooler in the room otherwise we wouldn't have survived any nights with that heat! But be prepared with ear plugs because it is very very noisy.  The big down side of the room is that, for some reasons, there are 2 windows in the room that give on the corridor and communal area, meaning you have no intimacy whatsoever in the evening if the lights are on! I didn't understand why there were no black curtains or something... It was really frustrating. Also, on our last night, the wifi was turned off, which was really annoying as I was relying on it entirerly to contact my family :("},{"_id":"322251095","date":{"$date":"2018-09-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"24208472","reviewer_id":"145730755","reviewer_name":"Lexie","comments":"Reina was so helpful and accommodating on our visit!

Anyone going to the bathroom or kitchen could see in our room if we had the lights on. The door had a lock but it was warped so it didn’t actually lock.

Tuvimos la gran suerte de tener la habitación D, teníamos dos zonas privadas, una con una mesa un espejo y 4 sillas que daba a nuestra habitación -donde estaba la cama y una mesa de noche. Por las noches podías cerrar la habitación de fuera y se quedaba una habitación enorme. \nLa ubicación espectacular, literalmente a 15-20 minutos de lower manhattan (mi parte favorita), la parada del metro a menos de 5 minutos.

Super clean, well-located, and super responsive hosts. The subway is literally around the corner and the area has good bars and coffeeshops just a short walk away. One thing is the room we stayed in was extremely hot (even in February), and the windows opened to an enclosed skylit space rather than the outside, so there was no fresh/cold air to let in. That said, when we inquired about turning off the radiators, etc. after the first night, Reina was so helpful, responded quickly, and even followed up to check if we were able to resolve the issue. Would totally recommend this place to anyone visiting from out of town who is looking to check out the neighborhood and/or commute between Brooklyn and Manhattan."}]}
