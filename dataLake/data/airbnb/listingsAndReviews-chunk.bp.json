(Can hear the a bit of sound, but the noise level really manageable) The apartment is newly furnished with full amenities. Bed is comfortable. Vodafone shop is just downstairs. The nearest supermarket is 2-3 min away. Train station maybe 5min walking distance. (3 to 4 stops to the historic places in Porto.) Direct bus to the beach. Quite a few good restaurants around. Not to mention, the host communicate promptly and give very useful tips. Highly recommend, particularly if you plan for longer stay in Porto."}]}

Great location - close to the volcano and a quick drive to town. Seeing the volcano at night for the 4th of July really offered up great \"fireworks\"! House was set up well for visitors - well equipped kitchen and rooms as described (my 8-year-old loves having her own room in the loft). \n\nBecky was a phenomenal host. She provided good directions ahead of our visit, so it was easy to find the house and easy to let ourselves in. She also provided a list of things to do around Volcano and Hilo, and we spent a good deal of time working through her lost.\n\nWe did have an issue when we arrived - a miscommunication between Becky and the local property manager about the timing of our arrival. I was impressed with how responsive and apologetic both of them were. Jo, the property manager, came over to personally apologize and we resolved it to my complete satisfaction. Sometimes you learn a lot about how well a property is managed when things go wrong, and these folks are great.

The house itself is quiet and comfortable. It's the perfect forest retreat to relax and enjoy nature and close the State volcano park.

The dehumidifiers are key as the location is in the rainforest and humidity is definitely there - the carpets can have a damp feel at times but this should be expected. \nThe condiments in the fridge and cupboard were very handy as we used the outdoor propane grill one night. The gas fireplace was handy - it does get cool in the evenings even in the summer. We loved the washer/dryer as it was a good size (not like those tiny ones you see stacked in a closet in other rental units).\nWe arrived after sun down so the road was a bit dark as is the whole neighborhood. Don't expect much in the form of street lights or visible street signs. Thank goodness for GPS and smart phone maps. The free wifi was handy as our cell phone carrier signals were weak. \nThe proximity to the entrance to Volcanoes National Park cannot be beat. It gave us an early start into the park and gave us a great place to stay the night after a full day there (including watching sunset from the Jagger Museum lookout).\nWe were very happy with our stay thanks to Becky and her accommodation.

Forno sporchissimo, come tutte le stoviglie. Passando ai bagni, lo scarico delle due docce era intasato e quindi la doccia si faceva col rischio che l'acqua  trasbordasse dal piatto doccia. I materassi erano sporchi e  con le molle che uscivano. La biancheria vecchia, sporca e strappata. Le foto le ho inviate alla proprietaria subito e sono visibili nella chat. Nessuno ha preso provvedimenti, la biancheria l'ho comprata nuova e in parte ho lavato quella della casa.  Con il poco tempo che avevo per la vacanza, tenuto conto del fatto che ho perso già il pomeriggio del 18 aprile a seguire la cameriera che  ci é stata mandata senza  che nessuno dei proprietari si presentasse, non avevo intenzione di aprire una querelle con Airbnb, che mi avrebbe tolto altro tempo.

If you are traveling with large suitcases that are heavy, this is not fun going or leaving. \n\nOverall the apartment was okay. The smell as soon as you enter the building is not good. We soon found out that the building must have a piping problem. We smelled the smell when we first got there to drop off our luggage, but when we came back for actual stay, they cleaned and tried to conceal it. Worked for only a while but smell was there until we left. One night there was a loud noise and when we got up we saw that the plaster from inside the ceiling had fell onto the kitchen counter, right near the pipes. \n\nWe had an issue with the wifi and asked David for help as well as asking him for the sheets to cover the other beds in each room(they only covered one bed in each room). David replied to me hours later stating that the beds were made for 3 people who were the amount of people we paid for and how he will contact someone about the wifi the next morning. I understand that there were 3 people staying there, but if you go to a hotel, how would you feel if one bed was unmade your entire stay? Also, he never checked on the wifi or checked on us to ask was it working properly, I eventually fixed it myself. One thing I did find quite strange was a woman knocking at our door stating she was \"a woman from upstairs\". When we opened the door she asked us were we with Airbnb and if our wifi wasn't working and how hers wasn't working either. This was quite bizarre and she then let us know she was staying with one of the guys upstairs. Sure. We later believed that she was someone David knew and was checking to see if we had others in the apartment because it was just TOO WEIRD! \n\nApartment is very close to transportation and we tried to overlook all of the issues to ensure that our stay was a good one. \n"},{"_id":"149789246","date":{"$date":"2017-05-06T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3127809","reviewer_id":"18025649","reviewer_name":"Michael","comments":"Wir haben hier nur mit 6 Personen übernachtet.

It was for the most part very clean, except for some mould on the wall in one room. Overall, it fit our needs as a group of students needing a place to stay for a visit to Barcelona.\n\nI had some difficulty arranging the key pick-up when I first booked the apartment. The rental appears to be through a third party company that requested I fill out an \"arrival form,\" however, there were technical issues with the online form the prevented me from completely it. Eventually, I got in touch with David, who was our host (we never met or heard from Pilar, the host on the airbnb listing). Once we got in contact with David, we arranged for him to meet us at the apartment when we arrived to let us in. We appreciated that he was flexible with us when our flight was delayed and we arrived about an hour later than planned. However, the apartment was not quite ready when we arrived; it was still being cleaned. \n\nThe other issue we experienced was that upon arrival, our host, David, requested that we pay a Barcelona tourism tax. The tax worked out to about 30 euros (for five of us staying three nights) and he wanted us to pay it to him on the spot in cash. We were slightly taken aback, as we had already paid for the airbnb, and did not expect any further expenses.

Every night we fall asleep so easily and soundly and every morning it takes us ages to get off the bed because it’s really just that comfortable. You have to try it to believe it.\n\nWhile Andy wasn’t around in the place, her friend Jacque was and she was the warmest person ever. We were late checking in on the first night and she waited for us to get back so she could welcome us in. \n\nThe toilets are also very extremely clean and well fitted, hot water readily available.\n\nAndy also lives in a really nice quiet neighbourhood that isn't too far off from the city too, which is great cos travelling is convenient and you still get to come home to peace and quiet. That being said, there are plenty of great cafe's and eateries around the neighbourhood, so if you feel like avoiding the city hustle, you're covered.\n\nAll in all, we can’t recommend Andy’s place enough and we will definitely be back again soon!"},{"_id":"417076579","date":{"$date":"2019-02-26T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"31318633","reviewer_id":"90140539","reviewer_name":"Hyeseul","comments":"Andy’s place was a lovely, bright and sunny room even though it was a bit far from lightrail or bus stops.

FIrst of all he really help us out at the time of finding accomodation since we only started looking for it one day before our arrival to Rio. When we did the chek-in at his place he gave us a full master class about Rio, the different areas and things we could do to make the most out of our stay. He filled us up with all kinds of info about buses, metro, prices and so on. Also, he was kind enough to take us out for a walk around the neighbourhood, including a really interesting visit to a nearby favela. \r\nTo anyone thinking about staying at this one or any other of Levy's appartments I would suggest not to hesitate too much and book it at once, before it's too late and somebody else does ;)"},{"_id":"2513129","date":{"$date":"2012-10-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"313223","reviewer_id":"3469211","reviewer_name":"Roberto","comments":"Apartment was clean, well equipped and perfectly located for my work-trip-but-I-still-want-know-Rio plans.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you're visiting Rio for the first time, the best reason to get this apartment is the host.\r\n\r\nSenhor Levy is extremely nice and helpful, showing around and recommending plans."},{"_id":"3015481","date":{"$date":"2012-12-03T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"313223","reviewer_id":"4039992","reviewer_name":"Ricardo","comments":"O Levy é extremamente atencioso, e o apartamento é muito bem localizado.  recomendo definitivamente!"},{"_id":"3078418","date":{"$date":"2012-12-12T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"313223","reviewer_id":"1473515","reviewer_name":"Carl","comments":"I travel to Brazil with some frequency and rent apartments there.  If you are going to Rio you should be prepared to receive less for your money than you might expect. \r\nThis apartment is definitely well above average.  The location is excellent in terms of access to the beach, the metro, groceries, and restaurants, bars, etc.  The little park across the street hosts a number of interesting fairs during the week as well. It is in Ipanema proper, not Copa or Arpoador, and should command a higher price. The furnishings are well above average for Brazil.  There is relatively a lot of space, and the bedroom is separate and has a nice AC.  The kitchen/living room is well equipped as well.   This area cannot be cooled well because the windows cannot be closed.  Levy says this is a Brazilian regulation because of the gas water heater and stove, and this sounds about right for Brazil.  There is a washer, and a small clothes drying rack above, and a second toilet.  Everything works well in the kitchen.  All this is very good.\r\nOn the downside the sofa is possibly the most uncomfortable I have ever sat in. It is hard and  if you lean back it wants to unfold into a bed.  The TV receives no English channels, although occasionally you might find one show in English.  No sports either.  There is no outside view, but the windows allow good light.\r\nLevy himself is very helpful and ready to provide you with helpful advice and guidance for the area.  He wants you to enjoy your stay.  Believe me, this is a rarity.\r\nI also recommend the BnB structure which allows you to pay by credit card.  Almost all apartment owners in Rio want you to pay in cash in advance with American dollars or Euros.  You have little recourse if you have problems, and the rental agencies will almost always side with the owners because that is how they make money.  Be very careful!  Scams are common.\r\nAll in all, I would say this is one of the best values I have received in Rio in my many travels.  I would stay there again, and I recommend this owner highly.  4 stars is a high rating for me.  I don't think I have ever experienced \"excellence\" in Brazil in terms of lodging, even at much higher prices or in hotels.  This apartment is pretty close to as good as it gets, at least in anything remotely close to this price."},{"_id":"3425608","date":{"$date":"2013-01-28T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"313223","reviewer_id":"4264821","reviewer_name":"Giovanni","comments":"Apartamento ótimo, com móveis novos, cama e sofá cama muito confortaveis e espaçosos, roupa de cama e toalhas limpos e em perfeita condição, banheiro excelente, wifi e TVs muito bons e tudo funcionando.

The beach is slightly further away but still an easy walk.\r\n\r\nThe apartment itself comfortably fit the two of us. There are two toilets which is handy. Having a clothes washing machine is handy for longer stays. You can hear the neighbours talking as the apartments are set closely together but we did not have any troubles sleeping.

He was an incredible host and always replied to our questions within 24 hours.

We stayed for 5 nights and found it very easy to get around and loved being so close to so many restaurants, cafes, juice bars and supermarkets. The apartment is a good size for 2 people, with 1.5 bathrooms, but i can imagine it would be a bit tight if you had extra people staying in the living room. The building and apartment feels secure and we did not feel unsafe at all when walking around the area, even at night.\r\n\r\nProbably the only downside to the apartment is that since there is only one window (in the bedroom) that opens onto the neighbouring apartment's balcony there is not much natural light in the rest of the apartment. The AC and fans work well but we found it a bit difficult to dry clothes and towels during the day, as we did not want to leave the windows open when we left the apartment.\r\n\r\nLevy is an incredibly friendly host who went out of his way to give us a tour when we first arrived and also lots of advice on restaurants, buses, sights and other useful information.

We originally had some problems with the pillows, which we emailed him about and it took not even an hour for him to call us and replace the pillows the same day. He even walked us and our luggage to the hotel from which we were picked up for our onward trip and offered us to leave our luggage at his private place on our last day which would have been very helpful due to our late night flight departure. \nThe flat in Ipanema was very central to everything. Only minor thing to note was that it is in a short one way street, that many taxis don't bother driving into and rather drop you at the corner with the main street. Since there is a favela in the near vicinity that made us a little uncomfortable at night sometimes. \n"},{"_id":"8601244","date":{"$date":"2013-11-07T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"313223","reviewer_id":"9268268","reviewer_name":"Märta","comments":"The apt is at a great spot if you like to stay in ipanema.

Muy cordial y dispuesto, nos llevó al “Mirante da Paz” que está a 50 mts del departamento, una construcción nueva que provee una vista privilegiada de la zona de Ipanema.\r\n\r\nEl edificio tiene un encargado (portero) y está ubicado a media cuadra de la Plaza Gral Osorio, que es el nodo de transporte de Ipanema por dónde pasa el 50% de los buses de Rio; además tiene la cabecera de la Línea 1 de metro; y próximamente la de la Línea 4 que irá hasta Barra de Tijuca; lo cual lo pone en una situación privilegiada con respecto al transporte. En cada una de las esquinas hay un supermercado (Zona Sul y Hortifruti) y al estar a 50 mts de Vizconde de Pirayá (el eje comercial de Ipanema) existe una infinita variedad de lugares para comer, asi como comercios en general. La playa de Ipanema está a dos cuadras y  a un máximo de seis cuadras la de Copacabana.\r\n\r\nEn cuanto al equipamiento, el departamento consta de un dormitorio grande con una cama matrimonial; dos baños; comedor diario y cocina completa. Todos los ambientes con aire acondicionado y ventilador de techo; conexión wifi inalámbrica;  dos Smart TV con cable básico de Sky; vajilla, utensillos y cubiertos en perfecto estado.

He went above and beyond and took time away from his already planned scheduled haircut to meet us near the subway station by his house so he could walk with us through the neighborhood to his home. Additionally, he made flexible arrangements with us to have us check-in immediately when we arrived into New York (which was around noon and way before 3pm as Air bnb suggests). The neighborhood in the daytime is very uplifting and diverse with many markets in the area. The subway station is as Victor described about 10 minutes walking to each station nearby and 20 minute ride into the city. I would suggest walking with a buddy at night though as it does make you feel a bit uneasy when it gets dark to walk there alone, but Victor definitely was good about reassuring that nothing goes wrong even after hours.

Victor's private room is as described, clean cozy and very spacious for two people.   It started snowing and getting back to the house was always pleasant, the heater is great! Hot water too.

Victor's schedule and mine clashed so I didn't have the opportunity to meet him (which I regret :(   )  but he made everything available to me in the house. Also, when I had a question he was always available through text. The neighborhood is good and felt really safe walking the streets after dark.

The amount of interaction I have with guests varies. I am a live-in host so our paths will definitely cross every now and again. Many guests choose to do their own thing and there are others who I've gotten to know a little bit. We've gone out for drinks and/or dinner and I have given some of them a little tour of the neighborhood and surrounding area.

I view visitors more as short-term roommates than I do as guests.\r\n\r\nHome-sharing truly has been a blessing for me. It's helped me to pay the rent and still given me the flexibility to have the place all to my own when I'd like to do so. That's a huge benefit!\r\n\r\nAs a guest, I have used Airbnb to travel to Tokyo and spent a few weekends staying at a farmhouse outside New York City. We watched films on the side of a barnhouse. Very cool!\r\n\r\nI am a relatively easy-going guy. I drink socially and do not smoke or use drugs. I definitely like to have fun, especially if it involves doing something new and it doesn't cost a ton of money. I love deals!\r\n\r\nWhile I tend to be easy-going, I do have my pet-peeves. For example, a shoes-free home means just that. With that said, I ask that you please review the house \"rules\" before you book with me.\r\n\r\nEither as a host or a guest, I'd be up for hanging out some time. I like to meet new people and explore the city together. If you'd like to hang out during your visit, then let me know in advance. My work schedule is pretty unpredictable and I often do work from home. I can get pretty busy, but if you give me some advance notice I'll make sure we have time to spend together. Otherwise, I generally assume that guests want independence.\r\n\r\nIf you prefer to do your own thing, then that's totally fine too. Don't worry I won't be offended. I can certainly appreciate that you may have a pretty full itinerary when you come to NYC.\r\n\r\nI'm a former journalist, PR guy and worked for a non-profit in the sustainable agriculture / environmental field for many years. I started my own coaching/consulting business a few years ago and would be interested to find out more about what's going on in your life. Perhaps I can help you out in some way?\r\n\r\nMy guests have included a combination of tourists and business travelers. Whichever category you fall under, you're welcome to stay with me. I have an extra room and I'd be happy to provide you with an opportunity to step into the shoes of a New York City resident for a while. Who knows? Maybe you'll like the East Village so much that you'll want to find your own apartment and never want to leave.\r\n\r\nI host singles and couples, but you should note that there is an added fee of $30 per night for all additional guests over one person.\r\n\r\nThe most common things I hear from guests are:\r\n\r\n\"The room is so much bigger than I thought based on the photos in your listing,\"\r\n\r\n\"This is a really cool room/place!\"\r\n\r\n\"I love the natural light that comes into this room!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's such a comfy atmosphere in here that I really hate to leave!\"\r\n\r\nGuests really love the location! location! location!\r\n\r\nOn the flip side, I sometimes hear people remark that walking up five flights is \"telling them that they need to get into better shape.\"\r\n\r\nIf nothing else, I hope that you'll find your visit with me to be enlightening (that's a joke because the bedroom is well-lit and I am a life coach ;)\r\n\r\nLook forward to meeting you!","host_response_time":"within an hour","host_thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/fbda491b-8a9a-46d4-8811-2f90ffcce1c1.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","host_picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/fbda491b-8a9a-46d4-8811-2f90ffcce1c1.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","host_neighbourhood":"East Village","host_response_rate":100,"host_is_superhost":true,"host_has_profile_pic":true,"host_identity_verified":true,"host_listings_count":1,"host_total_listings_count":1,"host_verifications":["email","phone","facebook","reviews","manual_offline","jumio","government_id"]},"address":{"street":"New York, NY, United States","suburb":"Manhattan","government_area":"East Village","market":"New York","country":"United States","country_code":"US","location":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.98717,40.73171],"is_location_exact":true}},"availability":{"availability_30":14,"availability_60":18,"availability_90":27,"availability_365":260},"review_scores":{"review_scores_accuracy":10,"review_scores_cleanliness":10,"review_scores_checkin":10,"review_scores_communication":10,"review_scores_location":10,"review_scores_value":10,"review_scores_rating":95},"reviews":[{"_id":"944492","date":{"$date":"2012-02-23T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"314982","reviewer_id":"1189841","reviewer_name":"Jay","comments":"Good place to stay and Chris is easy to get along with.

Christopher’s apartment was the ideal location for my 24 hours in New York.  Dropped off my bag at 8 in the morning and didn’t return until 12 hours later.  Christopher directed me to a pizza place near his house (Patsy’s) and I had one of the best pizzas ever! His apartment is located in the East Village so you’re in the middle of things.  A short walk from Union Square and the subway (and Milk Bar just down the street for great desserts).  It was the ideal place to crash for the night.

En fait j'ai ete agréablement surprise par le process de vérification au moment de la transaction. C'est en même temps rassurant et on s y sent accompagné. \r\nLe séjour très court (1 nuit) chez Christopher s est très bien passe. Le quartier est très sympa et animé. Au premier abord  l immeuble semble un peu glauque. Immense couloir bleu clair, tres (Website hidden by Airbnb) fait un peu coupe gorge. Mais arrivant a 17h je n etais pas trop inquiete. Apres avoir grimpe 4 etages avec ma valise je suis arrivee dans un apprtement petit mais tres sympa et Christopher m a tres bien accueillie. Il m a montre la chambre , la cuisine, la salle de bains  et les modalites de fonctionnement des differents appareils dont je serai potentiellement amenée à utiliser, qq conseils pour les Resto autour et le jogging du lendemain. La chambre est privee, le lit en mezzanine . Ce nest pas bruyant, prevoir des lunettes de nuit si vous etes sensibles a la lumiere du jour car aux US il est rare que les rideaux soient occultants et encore plus rare qu il y ait des volets !!!! Christopher dort ds le même appart  dans une autre pièce dans un espace délimite par des paravents, ce qui permet d aller à la cuisine et à la salle de bains sans se déranger mutuellement. Salle de bains étroite mais on est à NY !!!!!!! Christopher a même eu la gentillesse de m offrir une place de croisière sur la Hudson river dont il avait bénéficié lui même ! Sympa !  Je recommande vivement ce logement, surtout si vous êtes seul (e). A deux c'est jouable aussi. L appart de Christopher et le quartier tout autour font vite oublier l'entrée et le couloir un peu glauques de l entrée de l immeuble !!!"},{"_id":"2588103","date":{"$date":"2012-10-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"314982","reviewer_id":"2986593","reviewer_name":"Belinda","comments":"Chris was a fantastic host and I cannot recommend him highly enough.

I was getting constantly kicked off of the Internet (loosing the signal). This was after the Sandy storm so it is possible that things changed due to the storm. However it did not seem to me that Chris was doing much in spite of my complaints. He finally called the provider two weeks into my stay. Also the smaller room in which he sleeps is on the way to the room in which you will stay, so you will always have to go through his room in order to enter yours.

I absolutely loved the spacious room and how tidy the apt is.  He has a guidebook that was helpful, take a peak, it's worth it!  You won't care about the 5 flights of stairs once you settle in.

Overall it was good stay for my first AirBnB experience. The last time I was in NYC I stayed at Affinia Shelburne which cost me $200+ a night and I hardly stayed in my room so if you do the math it's not really a good bang for your buck. The room was cozy and I had enough space to relax after a day of walking around the city. There were minor caveats but they were not a deal breakers for me - but it might be for someone reviewing this. First the building is old and there's no elevator so if you have knee/physical problems walking up \u0026 down 5 flights of stairs several times a day could pose a problem. Second there's no central air conditioning, there's a fan in the room that kept me cool enough but if you're from a colder climate and like to sleep at a cold temperature this could be an issue for you. Chris was a very helpful host he answered all my concerns and gave good advice on subway traffic.

He provided a lot of written information for guests, and was open to allowing use of the kitchen. Chris was proactive in offering an iron and ironing board, and experienced in hosting people from different time zones. I appreciated that he checked about coordinating when I expected to be up in case I needed to be somewhere at a particular time. He answered questions about neighborhood resources or transportation when asked. Despite a heat spell, I was able to sleep well in the loft bed, and appreciated that it had a shelf where I could keep my phone to check time in the morning. On arrival, I was a little daunted about bringing my bags up to the fifth floor, but neither the building access nor the neighborhood environment seemed challenging. To reach the guest room, you pass through a sitting area where his sleeping space is walled off by a ceiling-high partition. The lodging is presented as a share, and the written materials do encourage guests to lend a hand by watering plants in their room and stripping the bed upon departure. On the first day, I was a little distracted and accidentally forgot to wash up my coffee-making equipment, but texted him an apology, and when I mentioned it later, he responded graciously."},{"_id":"168045642","date":{"$date":"2017-07-08T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"314982","reviewer_id":"104325511","reviewer_name":"Rolf","comments":"Zentrale Lage, ein bisschen lsut, mir hat es gefallen "},{"_id":"179509021","date":{"$date":"2017-08-07T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"314982","reviewer_id":"1981444","reviewer_name":"Fernando","comments":"Chris was a good and respectful host, the location of the place is perfect!

The room is big enough for two persons and the kitchen and bathroom are well-equipped."},{"_id":"215979015","date":{"$date":"2017-12-02T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"314982","reviewer_id":"9006660","reviewer_name":"Matteo","comments":"Very nice place"},{"_id":"217085605","date":{"$date":"2017-12-07T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"314982","reviewer_id":"97691128","reviewer_name":"Nathaniel","comments":"Chris is a really great guy!!

I had no problem with the late check in and I hope that if I needed the late check out, it could be offered. He is flexible and I appreciate that as a traveler. His apartment was so clean and so central to everything! The Cinelandia metro station was close by and there are numerous buses that pass by. You have the national theater, the national library and other museums near by. You also have the Feira Uruguaiana close by to shop for all the things you want to take back home. It is a safe location and very close to Lapa (the night life). It is a great central point to branch out and see so many different things in Rio.

For those who are not familiar with Rio they may find the surrounding area to be intimidating as its the downtown core, but there really is nothing to fear.  One block away is the state assembly, municipal theatre, national library, and many dazzling examples of architecture for which Rio was once famously called \"Paris of South America\".  There are several nice restaurants where you can enjoy a wonderful evening sipping cold beer and people watching.  \r\nFor me the most convenient aspect of this apartment was its proximity to the US Consulate...the reason for my visit.  If you have anything to do in the downtown area this apartment is well located and convenient...including a short taxi ride from the local municipal airport - Santos Dumont.  \r\nAlso just one block away is the metro station where you can easily go to the famous beaches of Rio/Copacabana/Ipanema for only R$3.5 per person.  \r\nThe apartment was completely renovated and in excellent condition...something you do not find very often in Brasil.  The bed was comfortable and stocked with extra blankets \u0026 pillows.  Because we were traveling in winter we didn't need to use the a/c...being on the 18th floor we were up high enough to get a nice refreshing breeze.

Além disso, mostrou-se super flexível com relação aos horários de check in e check out, o que ajudou bastante. Sou carioca e aluguei o apartamento por 10 dias pois moro distante dos principais pontos turísticos e estava recebendo a visita do meu namorado alemão. Portanto, posso afirmar com propriedade que ao levar em conta a localização, custo-benefício e conforto não existe melhor opção do que esse apartamento. O imóvel é exatamente como nas fotos!!! A cozinha é muito bem equipada, o cooktop funciona perfeitamente e você encontra todos os utensílios necessários para cozinhar. O box do banheiro é super espaçoso, com blindex e um chuveiro elétrico muito bom! Você também irá encontrar suportes super funcionais dentro do box para estender a sua roupa molhada. A ventilação do apartamento é ótima, fato que nos levou a usar o ar-condicionado apenas uma vez. O mesmo atende maravilhosamente todo o espaço e não é barulhento. O frigobar é mais espaçoso do que aparenta a foto, e tanto o sofá-cama como o colchão da cama principal são super confortáveis! Recebemos o apto limpo com toalhas e roupa de cama. Havia toalhas, roupa de cama e dois travesseiros extras à disposição. O wi-fi funcionou bem durante toda a nossa estadia. O fato do prédio ser comercial é um plus super positivo, pois há porteiros 24h além de circuito interno de câmeras em todos os andares e nos elevadores, que são modernos e espaçosos. O prédio também é muito silencioso, não tivemos nenhum problema com relação a isso. Ao redor do prédio você encontra várias opções de bares, restaurantes, padarias, bancos, e lojas em geral. Depois de visitar todos os pontos turísticos que o Centro da Cidade oferece, você poderá explorar facilmente os demais bairros como Copacabana, Ipanema, Leblon, Lagoa, Jardim Botânico e adjacências através do metrô que fica a uma quadra de distância. Já o bairro da Lapa e Santa Teresa são facilmente acessados a pé. Pegamos táxi apenas 2 vezes por uma questão de comodidade e utilizamos um aplicativo. Ambos chegaram em menos de 5 min. Mas na porta do prédio também é possível pegar facilmente um táxi a qualquer hora. Até mesmo ao enfrentar uma frente fria no Rio, fomos surpreendidos com um guarda-chuva à nossa disposição dentro do armário de produtos de limpeza na cozinha, ou seja, não faltou nada mesmo!!!

He let me check in a little early since I had an early flight in, and check out late afternoon since I had an evening flight out and the apartment wasn't rented that day.  He also promptly fixed the shower when there was no hot water and when the toilet wouldn't stop flushing.\r\n\r\nThe apartment is well located in Centro, just 400 meters from the Cinelandia Metro station and the Municipal Theater, and lots of nearby restaurants, although most of them are closed on the weekends.  The apartment is fairly small but comfortable enough for one or two people; the bed is very comfortable, and the small refrigerator is adequate.  The kitchen is very small but sufficient to heat up something on the stove or in the microwave.  The bathroom is fine, with a good shower, and some racks to dry any washing you may have done.\r\n\r\nThere are three issues with the apartment, which could range from just irritating to a serious negative, depending on how important they are to a prospective renter:\r\n1) The apartment is on, and the window faces, Rua Evaristo da Veiga, a very busy, noisy street, with lots of bus and car traffic.  Even though the apartment is on the 18th floor, you can hear some noise, even with the window shutter closed, at all hours, although the air conditioner drowns out most of it when it is on;\r\n2) The TV is old and there are no international channels, only local Brazilian channels, half of which cannot be seen because of bad reception and none of which are of any interest to a non-Brazilian, so you will not be watching much TV if you are a foreigner;\r\n3) Given the TV situation, good Wi-Fi is even more important; however, the W-Fi in the apartment, while good when it is working, shuts down and restores itself at random, which was frustrating, and sometimes the router had to be manually turned off and back on again when the Wi-Fi didn't restore itself.  Luiz is aware of the problem but apparently nothing can be done about it.\r\n\r\nGiven the location, the apartment features, and the price, I would definitely stay here again and can recommend staying here if the issues described above are not important to a potential renter."},{"_id":"76008385","date":{"$date":"2016-05-24T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3155979","reviewer_id":"69516484","reviewer_name":"Luis Alberto","comments":"Tudo Ok, aproveitamos bem nossa estadia.
