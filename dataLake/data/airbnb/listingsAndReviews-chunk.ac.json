I stayed here from Aug 15 - Sep 19, while I was waiting for my permanent place I was moving into to be ready, and then when it got delayed, Karen and Ofer were extremely helpful and able to extend my stay from Sep 19 to Oct 6.  I am moving to the UES, so while in transition I decided to give the UWS side a try.  The apartment is on 89th between West End and Riverside, quiet and beautiful street, right down the block from Riverside Park and the Soldiers and Sailors Memorial.  Dog park and jogging path along the water right down the stairs.  86 Street 1 train is just a few blocks away, and plenty of good eating right down the block (Carmine's, Vino e Cibo, Little Mermaid).   Love the neighborhood, and after staying here I wish I had considered an apartment in this neighborhood...  Karen and Ofer were extremely responsive on AirBNB and text.  The studio faces the back courtyard of the building (no direct access) so it is very quiet, though a little shady during the day (not dark, but you can't quite tell if it is cloudy or not).  Despite being a studio, it is spacious, and is furnished with plenty of cooking tools, dishes, etc if you are cooking.  Overall highly recommend, whether you are looking for temporary housing like I needed, or just visiting the City for a vacation, and want to check out the Upper West Side this is a great place / location / hosts."},{"_id":"64367156","date":{"$date":"2016-03-03T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1132409","reviewer_id":"50871466","reviewer_name":"Rebecca","comments":"Karen was a great host!

She contacted me before we arrived to prepare us for the checking in process. She was very accommodating our rushed arrival (we had dinner res.!) and had a great printout regarding any questions we might have about her home. \r\n\r\nWe really enjoyed her cat Tsitsou. I have a cat allergy but she was so friendly and hospitable that I even managed to give her a few good pats. Teodora's place is very clean, so my allergic reaction was minimal. \r\n\r\nThe location is great. It's less than a 10 min walk to the Metro and very easy to find street parking. We enjoyed the garden space very much. We sat out there one late afternoon and felt as though we were truly Montreal residents!\r\n\r\nOne suggestion I make (which is NOT a deal breaker) is perhaps a small fan in the guest room. The windows are not very big, and we kept the door closed, to keep Tsitsou out, and it got stuffy pretty quickly. \r\n\r\nI will be giving Teodora a 10/10 and we hope to come back to visit soon!"},{"_id":"101628856","date":{"$date":"2016-09-14T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11364106","reviewer_id":"45739396","reviewer_name":"Camila","comments":"On a eu un excellent séjour chez (Website hidden by Airbnb) maison est jolie et accueillante et elle a tout ce qu'on a besoin...en plus elle est proche de tout!"},{"_id":"179861511","date":{"$date":"2017-08-08T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11364106","reviewer_id":"131547994","reviewer_name":"Megan","comments":"Teodora was very friendly and showed us around her home and garden.

The place had a lovely vibe and even the bed and the pillows were comfy – and we have a Tempur at home so I’m very picky with beds!  Oh and the artwork is awesome!\r\n\r\nThe garden is lovely too and it’s a short walk to the end of the street to the beach and the national park. The beach is GORGEOUS!! Crystal clear, calm water and pretty seashells. Its also nice and protected so you don’t get blown away or sandblasted which happens on some other beaches.  Just past the beach is a path to the national park, which is so pretty. There were lots of birds and trees and beautiful giant rocks and some Aboriginal carvings. \r\n\r\nIt bucketed rain most of the weekend we were there but we still had a lovely weekend.

I wish I could have stayed longer. The studio is behind her house in a lush garden, perfectly furnished and clean. Belinda let us have our space and at the same time was very helpful, giving my friend a ride to the ferry and providing tips on Bundeena. \r\nAll you hear are birds, the wind through the trees and the ocean a couple blocks away. The National Park is around a corner and you're at the north tip of the beautiful coastal walk, which if you did it in its entirety would take two full days, requiring camping. We only walked as far as Little Marley Beach. Perhaps if I returned I would have rented a car one day so that I could have seen more of the southern coast of the park.\r\nThank you Belinda!

With beautiful Jibbon Beach and a bushwalk just minutes away, it was easy to get a nature hit everyday after a writing session in the studio.\r\n\r\nBelinda was also a very welcoming host, who even offered to pick me up from the supermarket after the weather turned nasty. After setting me up at the start, Belinda and her husband were also respectful of my privacy as I worked, and even though the studio is in the backyard behind their house, I didn't hear a peep. But Belinda was very responsive to my text messages if I needed anything.\r\n\r\nWould definitely recommend this place for a really comfortable and really reasonably priced getaway, solo or as a couple (my girlfriend visited for an evening and we enjoyed the surrounding beach and bush).

Belinda has great attention to detail and a creative talent shown through the decor of her spacey studio. It felt more like a quaint cottage with a self-sufficient kitchen and patio, where we spent much of our time relaxing.  Their place is surrounded by beautiful plants and trees, and their location is so close to all the beaches and walking trails.  Thank you Belinda and Chris for a lovely stay!

We'd like to thank Belinda for creating a beautiful self-contained studio space where we were able to relax, surrounded by a leafy garden. We felt immediately at home and had everything we needed to prepare and eat all of our meals there; and after exploring the surrounds during the days we were very happy to relax indoors in the evenings, listening to music and reading. The position of the studio is perfect, only a few minutes in either direction for a waterfront walk and to the local cafes and well-stocked IGA. We were fortunate for a late cancellation that we were able to book in last minute to the garden studio, but will be booking further in advance next trip to ensure availability in Belinda's garden studio.

От метро Para-lel (5мин. хотьбы) быстро добираетесь до всех Саград и музеев.На море я пешком ходила, вода отличная была. Если устали можно в кафешке у дома на Rambla del Raval посидеть.

Эта чудесная девушка не просто предоставила нам свои апартаменты, но и во многом помогала нам с навигацией по Барселоне, покупкой билетов и другим очень важным моментам, необходимым для самостоятельного туриста. Локация очень удобная, квартира чистенькая и уютная. В доме 2 прекрасных и ласковых кота, в которых мы сразу влюбились!

Почти равно удалено от всех развлечений. Недалеко от метро (рядом метро и автобусы), пляжа, музеев, парков и вокзалов. Удобно что рядом находится много магазинов, ресторанчиков и рынок Бокерия. \n2) Квартира чистая, просторная, 2 удобные комнаты где помещается 3 человеческие (обгорелые после пляжа, напившиеся сангрии и наевшиеся хамона) особи. В каждой комнате вместительные шкафы, спасительный вентилятор и кровать. Просторная кухня где можно приготовить только что купленного на рынке тунца (креветки, мидии) и там же большой стол где поместятся все и всё. Обычный душ и туалет (совмещённый). Человек-сосед с дрелью не обнаружен, спали с открытыми окнами вполне спокойно, и шумели на улице какие-то строители за неделю только 1 раз. \n3) Кошки. Все любителям кошек сюда. 2 классных игручих создания приятно дополнять отдых. Если у вас сильная аллергия на кошек, то решайте сами. \n4) Хозяйка. Алёна – отличный человек с которым за неделю очень сдружились. Дала много полезных советов о Барселоне. Приятный собеседник. \nЕсли (когда) поедем ещё раз, обязательно вернёмся в эту квартиру. \nМинусы. \n- Дверь в туалет не закрывается на ключ. Решается тем что стучишься прежде чем войти. \n- Нет кондиционера. Но за эти деньги есть только вентилятор и губозакатывающее устройство. \nИтого: Снимайте отличная квартира по соотношению цена качество. 10 Елен Летучих из 10."},{"_id":"171627263","date":{"$date":"2017-07-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1139810","reviewer_id":"133274970","reviewer_name":"Simone","comments":"Casa super accogliente, due splendidi gatti e una proprietaria di casa straordinaria!

В общем в этих чудесных созданий невозможно не влюбиться!\nКвартира чистая, аккуратная, большая гостиная. На кухне есть все необходимое. \nДом расположен в удобном месте, поблизости кафе, магазины, до пляжа минут 15 пешком. В пешей доступности располагается Готический квартал, улица Рамбла, метро и торговые центры.\nЕсли хотите почувствовать настоящую жизнь в Барселоне, а не скучный отельный отдых, приезжайте к Алене! \nЕще раз спасибо за теплый прием и отлично проведенное время!\nЖдем с нетерпением, чтобы вернуть еще, уже скучаем!;)"},{"_id":"252546516","date":{"$date":"2018-04-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1139810","reviewer_id":"63452465","reviewer_name":"Artur","comments":"Останавливались у Алёны на 4 дня.

У Алёны живут два чудесных котика, но они не доставляют абсолютно никаких проблем. Котики добрейшие, воспитанные, гладкошерстные (так что тем, кто боится шерсти, можно не волноваться).

Only issue we had was part of the tiling in the kitchen spontaneously cracked and broke leaving the doorway into the kitchen with a very uneven entrance.

Good central location in Sultanahmad. Just a short walk to the blue mosque and Hajia Sofia through a nice bazar. The rooms facing the street side are a bit noisy from the street traffic, so if you want a quite room, get the ones facing the garden. There is a washer and a small kitchen upstairs that you can use, and it connects to a terrace. Kamuran welcomed us when we got there and showed us our room. She's usually in the travel agency office downstairs so you can reach her easily if you need anything and get some recommendations on what to do or where to go. Word of advice, don't use their airport transfer car because it's more expensive then just getting a taxi from the airport (taxis run about 50 TL to Sultanahmed and their car transfer is 20$ which is about 72 TL ). We also had to wait 30 minutes outside the airport for the driver to pick us up.

We have walked all over from here, the metro stop is also close. There is a small kitchen and laundry place on the roof, which was great. Also the view is beautiful.

During our stay it was very hot in Istanbul so air-conditioning was a life saviour.

All the problems you might possibly have with the room will be solved in a blink of an eye!

Un imprévu nous a fait arriver 45 minutes en retard, quelques minutes avant le début de la finale de l'Euro à laquelle participait le Portugal; mais Christina nous attendait, avant d'aller rejoindre la foule de supporteurs au parc avoisinant.\r\nL'appartement est tel que décrit dans les nombreuses photos. Très propre, bien aéré, bien éclairé.\r\nIl nous a été très facile d'y dormir, l'endroit est habituellement très calme la nuit. La seule exception fut lors de la victoire du Portugal, où les gens klaxonnaient leur joie toute la nuit dans toute la ville. Cependant, il a suffit d'ouvrir le divan-lit dans la salle à manger et d'y déplacer quelques matelas pour dormir très paisiblement, une fois les portes des chambres fermées. Les rénovations en cours sur la façade ne nous ont pas incommodées.\r\nChristina a été très accueillante, nous laissant un parc pour bébé et une poussette pour notre séjour, en plus de la chaise pour bébé.\r\nLits et oreillers sont confortables, tout fonctionne très bien.\r\nLes nuits sont fraîches même en juillet, donc il n'y a pas besoin d'air climatisé.\r\nL'appartement est très bien situé, quelques minutes à pied suffisent à rejoindre les restaurants et emplacements intéressants. Pour faire changement, il y a d'ailleurs un excellent restaurant mozambiquais sur la rue à l'arrière de l'appartement.\r\nIl est au 4ième étage, alors il faut faire un petit exercice pour amener les valises, mais mieux vaut s'y habituer de toute façon pour explorer Porto! Par contre, il n'y a personne au dessus, et nous n'avons pas été gênés par les bruits des voisins, tout l'immeuble semble assez bien insonorisé.\r\nLa télévision et l'internet fonctionnent bien.\r\nIl y a aussi une structure de jeux dans le parc avoisinant, un atout pour les jeunes enfants (et une rareté dans les centre-villes). Plusieurs autobus arrêtent à quelques minutes de marche, dont plusieurs circuits touristiques (mais pas de bruit de bus).\r\nEn bref, un très bon appartement, on s'y sent comme à la maison."},{"_id":"87394159","date":{"$date":"2016-07-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11413023","reviewer_id":"66923517","reviewer_name":"María","comments":"Muy bien situado y muy buena decoracion."},{"_id":"88456833","date":{"$date":"2016-07-24T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11413023","reviewer_id":"57665991","reviewer_name":"Ana \u0026 Carlos","comments":"Cristina and her husband are really helpful and friendly.

Cristina provided us with a baby cot, high chair and a stroller for our littlest one- very much appreciated! She also provided us with two space heaters and a lot of extra blankets as it does get cold in the apartment in the winter, which made it that much better.

Et surtout il est à proximité d'une majorité de monuments, vous pouvez aisément vous y rendre à pied. Très proche de la gare ferroviaire Sao Bento et de la Ribeira 6 à 8 minutes à pied.  Attention tout de même, dans la rue, il y a un peu de bruit en début de nuit mais c’est normal vous êtes en plein centre-ville, on ne peut pas tout avoir. Nous sommes parties entre amies et toutes nous vous recommandons cet appartement."},{"_id":"252631214","date":{"$date":"2018-04-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11413023","reviewer_id":"26890881","reviewer_name":"Vanessa","comments":"This is a very nice and well located apartment in Porto.

I lived in the apartment for four years, and I absolutely loved waking up to a beautiful Sydney sunrise and the Harbour Bridge, and then watching the sparkling harbour from the comfort of the couch.  There are a number of beautiful harbourside parks nearby with excellent views, and Kirribilli Village is just a 7 minute walk away. Here you will find a number of excellent restaurants, cafes, bars and shops (including an excellent boutique Choclatier), as well as the wonderful Kirribilli Markets (on every second weekend), Luna Park, and award winning restaurants such as Garfish (excellent seafood), The Botanist (great cocktails), Batch (fantastic burgers), Street Market (great Asian Tapas style restaurant) Cool Mac (great Japanese fusion cafe) and Ripples Milsons Point - perfect for a casual meal under the Harbour Bridge. There are a number of great cafes wi","notes":"There will be basic provisions in the apartment for you upon your arrival, as well as instructions for the apartment and a guide of things to do/places to eat nearby/in Sydney. Obviously all linen, kitchen items, iron/ironing board and whatever else you need for your stay are provided - just make sure to let us know if you will require the sofa bed so we have all the linen ready. There are a number of unique artworks decorating the apartment of harbour scenes from the surrounding area by a local artist which are for sale - if you’re interested, let us know!","transit":"You can get to the city by ferry, bus or train: North Sydney Ferry Wharf - 400 metres Milsons Point Train Station - 650 metres Bus to CBD (direct to York St, no stops) - 280 metres The Ferry Trip to Circular Quay from North Sydney Wharf is stunning - a 15 minute trip over and a 10 minute trip back. From Milsons Point Train Station (7 minute walk), you are one station (a 4 minute train ride across the bridge) from Wynyard Station, Town Hall (8 minutes) or Central (12 minutes).  From Kirribilli/Milsons Point you can also access the public stairs to walk across the Harbour Bridge to The Rocks. The trip to and from Sydney Airport by Train takes 30 minutes, or a Taxi is roughly 15 minutes.","access":"You will have private access to the entire apartment and laundry, plus car space if needed.","interaction":"Basic provisions, welcome manual and dining suggestions provided.

The building is strictly no smoking, and unfortunately no pets are allowed due to Strata rules.

Please be assured this review isn't in spite of my husband's original booking/cancellation made via (Website hidden by Airbnb) which was cancelled days prior to our reservation due to owner (supposably) overbooking! With flights, baby/dog sitter \u0026 tours booked, this caused unnecessary stress. Desperately,  l searched airbnb for backup accommodation;  at peak time/short notice. I didn't think l would have much luck. Surprisingly \u0026 unknowingly, I had just booked the same unit my hubby was told was unavailable! It became even more apparent when Eleanor asked if I had used another I service as dates/surname were familiar. Through further messaging (address revealed) it was confirmed l had indeed rebooked the same unit! I was honest with Eleanor and expressed my disappointment and the unnecessary stressed she caused for no reason. Eleanor's excuse, in her words \" (Website hidden by Airbnb) seemed dodgy and l 'was going' to contact your husband to book via airbnb but it has worked out well\"...Really!? Everything aside, we decided to make the most of it; feeling relieved we had accommodation.  I wasn't going to mention this but after our stay, l feel compelled to continue to provide open \u0026 honest feedback. I hope others will do the same; not just about this property but others. I was upfront with Eleanor and will continue to do to so to the end. About our stay...good location - nearby restaurants/transport. \nWhen organising check in, Eleanor asked us to collect keys from her residence (which isn't just around the corner - it's over 1km away). We requested for cleaner to handover keys which was greatly appreciated. \nAfter cleaner left and our return, we struggled to open the front door with lock sticking and then to enter a hot box! There're only ceiling fans to move the air. In January temps; not ideal. Instructions were left on how to operate fan/lights but we couldn't get both working, but thankfully we only got the fans working. If you're thinking about staying here; make sure it's not during extreme hot/cold weather.\nEvery time the shower is used it leaks on the floor \u0026 remains wet 24 hrs!  Thankfully, info was left in book so we weren't alarmed. The view described was misleading.  Yes, you can see the harbour bridge if you 'stand' in the lounge. Windows are high \u0026 obscure the view. The balcony also overlooks a car park \u0026 derelict units. To see the bridge from here you also need to stand to the top end. The balcony door sticks; concerning with a full pane of glass. An accident waiting to happen. Upon departure,  we always empty bins, clean and strip beds. But I was horrified to find yellow stains on the bottom sheet at foot end of the bed..eeew! This really was the straw that broke the camels back! Believe me, we are not picky people, easy going, and all our reviews from other properties/ hosts have been positive. If you want true comfort, functional, a proper view; I definitely do not recommend this unit."}]}

The location is brilliant, close to everything at the top of porto. Short (5-10) walk up the hill from Sao Bento train station. If arriving at Campanhã train station, swap to take train to São Bento at no extra cost! Real world Porto in the mornings with street cleaners, pedestrians etc, but a great locale. Would definately stay again.

He gave us fantastic tips for socialising (Aduela, up the road, very nice) and eating (Dom Peixe in Matosinhos).  We had an especially early check out, and Tomás recommended the Goin' Porto shuttle, which saved us a few euros. \r\n\r\nThe apartment is on the first floor, immaculately clean, and has plenty of amenities (flat screen tv, washing machine, kitchen).  It's located a very short walk from the Clerigos Tower and university, so you are very well located if you chose to stay here. My only advice is that this apartment is on a pedestrian street, and the partying can continue until the early morning in Porto! So if you are a light sleeper, bring ear plugs :) All in all, this is a great apartment and Tomás was a great host.

You're also within a few minutes walk of more great restaurants and a bar.\n\nTomás was very helpful throughout our stay, he replied quickly and with all of the information we needed. We realised we didn't have an iron and he brought one over to us, they go out of their way to help, himself and Sofia were both very accommodating.  The amenities and WiFi are all excellent, everything is clean and well decorated. \n\nOther guests mentioned that the noise from the street below can be a bit much, but we didn't really get much noise at all. \nHowever, other people who were staying in the apartment building, on leaving, would slam the downstairs door which would rattle ours. Which wasn't a problem as you don't notice the first time, but as a reoccurring thing it can take its toll. That was our only negative comment about the apartment.\n\nOther than one negative point, we really enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay there again"},{"_id":"71425503","date":{"$date":"2016-04-25T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1144090","reviewer_id":"63577134","reviewer_name":"Marisa","comments":"A nossa estadia foi espetacular .

Auch der Weg an den Fluss ist nicht allzu weit und führt durch schöne Gassen und an vielen kleinen Geschäften vorbei. \nSamstag Nacht war es etwas laut weil es einige Bars und Restaurants in der Nähe gibt aber die restlichen Abende waren ruhig und wir haben sehr gut geschlafen. \nWer zur kühleren Jahreszeit kommt muss nicht frieren, die Heizung im Bad und der Elektro-Ofen haben tadellos funktioniert und es wurde schnell warm. \nAlles in allem hätten wir ein paar wunderschöne Tage und sind begeistert von Porto.

If you want peace and quiet, it might be wise to stay in another neighbourhood.\nThanks Tomás!"},{"_id":"277860614","date":{"$date":"2018-06-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1144090","reviewer_id":"6446623","reviewer_name":"Tom","comments":"Great location with everything you need to take full advantage of this beautiful city."},{"_id":"279018489","date":{"$date":"2018-06-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1144090","reviewer_id":"125979412","reviewer_name":"Wolfgang","comments":"Sehr nettes Appartment in ausgezeichneter Lage, lebhafte Umgebung und alles zu Fuß leicht zu erreichen!"},{"_id":"281707459","date":{"$date":"2018-06-25T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1144090","reviewer_id":"46069453","reviewer_name":"Alessia","comments":"Appartamento molto carino, pulitissimo e in posizione centrale.\nThomas è stato molto efficiente e sempre disponibile.\nAppartamento perfetto per un week-end in coppia!!"},{"_id":"282737154","date":{"$date":"2018-06-28T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1144090","reviewer_id":"37873755","reviewer_name":"Robert","comments":"Good central location  easy to get to from the airport by tram and then short walk, clean apartment .

Tomás is an excellent communicator and host: when the internet wasn't working, he came within a few hours and replaced the router. \n\nBe aware that because of the ideal location (directly on a cool pedestrian street 1 floor above bars and restaurants) that it can be extraordinarily loud at night. Bring your earplugs and use the 2 provided fans for white noise.  At one point, there was a crowd of people yelling, smoking, and smashing beer bottles under our windows at 2am. We turned the fans up to high and closed our windows, and it was fine. Would happily stay here again!

Tomás had excellent communication with us the entire time.  It was our first time in Porto and we loved Porto and this apartment!  We were greeted by Andreia.  Upon arrival, she went above and beyond in giving us awesome tips for local attractions, good restaurants, wineries, supermarket, pharmacy and all!  Tomás also had a booklet with all the information there so we could refer to it at any time!  Sitting in the balcony has the perfect view of a gorgeous street with cafes and shops!  The apartment was very well maintained, everything was sparkling clean (minus the bottom tiles of shower, but I think that is more due to the age of the shower and not because it wasn’t cleaned so no fault of the cleaning person).  I think the cleaner cleaned it the best it can be).  However, the rest of the apartment, and the bathroom are sparkling clean and awesome!  I am a germaphobe and I would definitely stay here again because the rest of the house was so clean so don’t let my tile comment deter you, this is an awesome place and at the center is everything and very well maintained!  It is walking distance to all the attractions.  The hosts did an awesome job of putting nice touches throughout the apartment.  It is bright with lots of nice light, which I love!  Also, the managing company allowed us to keep our luggage in their office (which is walking distance from the apartment) after our checkout time while we went sight seeing some more around the city.  Luis and other staff members also helped my parent with carrying the luggage down the stairs.  The hospitality was above and beyond and we loved our stay here.  I highly recommend this apartment and will definitely stay here again!  Also, lots of great restaurants right downstairs and a super market! Washing machine was awesome to have!

There is another beautiful viewpoint at the end of the street and a small cafe with a friendly owner to buy water and snacks.  Less than a 5 minute walk away you have cafes, restaurants and bakeries.  The river front is only ten minutes away and you are very well located for all the tourist sites.  The only disadvantage of this location is there isn't somewhere closer to buy fresh food and ingredients if you want to cook- there is a shop for basic goods about 5 minutes away but it's about a 15minute walk to the nearest supermarket (there may be one closer though we did check the internet).  However our experience of the apartment was extremely positive and we would recommend to others.

Easy access down to the river or a short 2 min walk to Clerigos Tower and all the attractions round there. Location ideal. Apartment was spotlessly clean and the port wine on arrival a nice touch. The balcony giving a view of Clerigos, the Cathedral, the monastery and the river was a real bonus both at day and night. Would recommend a stay here when visiting Porto.

I've never stayed in an AIRBNB before that was this clean. The entire building is immaculate and so full of charm. The view from the balcony was even more amazing than expected. Rosa's place is perfect if you are wanting to explore an old European town on foot without all the trappings of a tourist destination like Rome or Barcelona. There are so many historic sites hidden around corners and alleyways plus a good amount of places to eat and shop. You go one direction and  you are already in the historic Jewish district district where you can virtually walk in any direction and happen upon historic churches, squares or walk across the bridge to look out at both sides of river. Go a block or so in the other direction and you have the retail district filled with shops, restaurants etc. \nAs for the apartment itself, the master bedroom was private and a pretty good size even with multiple suitcases in various spots. We could hear the occasional footsteps upstairs but nothing too much to interrupt sleep or privacy. The leather sofa seemed new and had a sofa bed that our children voted to be the best they've ever slept on. The kitchen had everything we needed and everything was in working order. \nWe were only in Porto for two days which was terribly short for a city with so much to see and do.

When i check the location, had to cancel and rushed to my ultimate accommodation portal, broadcasting generic message to nearby hosts to secure an accommodation the soonest.\r\n\r\nAlison was among the first to reply, and to pre-confirm...\r\nBy the time i got there, Adam was already waiting for me and even kind enough to give me all the directions at 8am and off course waited for me outside to make sure that i'm paying the right cab fee. \r\n\r\nWhat can i say Adam, made feel at home from very first moment, kind, genuine and warm welcoming host. The house is is really nice fully refurbished, in a quite and well connected neighbourhood. My room was upstairs, a nice sunny room with  a queen bed and a bathroom attached. After i dropped in my luggage, Adam gave me guided orientation tour to the house, with access to all amenities. \r\n\r\nFelt like a VIP 5 star treatment as Adam even gave me a pre-paid bus ticket, which made my first(s) bus rides easier as some stations are pre-paid only.  So now that you that i have been at a great apartment, with great hosts, that's all, Rozelle is a really nice neighbourhood. walking distance from my hosts' place, you can make it to the main street packed, with cafe, bars and restaurant, a vibrant market and lot of attractions. if you happen to stay over a weekend don't miss Rozelle Market (Sat \u0026 Sun). \r\n\r\nNow the funny part, Adam was so happy to receive me as he's a all star backgammon player and he knows that Lebanese people are really good at that and he was so eager for round. One night we decided to play a round and Adam's expectations went all down the drain, i think i was the first Lebanese ever to be clumsy backgammon player. We agree that we will play another time via (Hidden by Airbnb) and i will have support from fellow Lebanese players :)\r\n\r\nAll in all, i great time, the house is warm, clean, and comfortable and the hosts are simply AWESOME  \r\n\r\n "},{"_id":"23483627","date":{"$date":"2014-12-01T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1145567","reviewer_id":"7277980","reviewer_name":"Ramon","comments":"Alison immediately replied to my booking request and organised for her hubby to meet me as I was checking in late.\r\n\r\nThey were very helpful and gave me a bus card to use.

We are both great chefs and love impressing guests with our delicious healthy breakfasts.

For example, we arrived to a rainstorm, and rather than have to go out to find a place to eat dinner with my daughter, Megan donned a hat, went out to her garden to pick fresh basil and proceeded to prepare a pasta dinner for all of her guests! It was so heartwarming to “break bread” and commune with Megan, her friends and guests from around the globe. So cool and unexpected! That was only the beginning. Again, totally unexpected, the next morning was the same as Megan and a friend whipped up breakfast for us all — Megan is clearly in her glory hosting guests, and her genuine passion was evident throughout our stay. She has an outdoor/indoor “Creation Station” for painting, making jewelry or designing to your heart’s delight, and the walls of her home are all adorned with artwork from guests. Magical. The room and bed were super comfy; we slept like babies. The location is divine, and once again, Megan served up two fabulous bikes to ride to the beach and along the coastline through Kona to the pier — where Megan was chilling with friends and even invited us to use her paddle boards. It just doesn’t end, and we were only there for less than 24 hours! Upon departure, Megan left us each with one of her handmade rings as a token of her creative artistry and a fond memory of her very big heart!"},{"_id":"132240515","date":{"$date":"2017-02-16T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11464859","reviewer_id":"7024777","reviewer_name":"Michael","comments":"All the reviews are accurate.

House-wise, the bed is very comfortable, bathroom is adequate and the common areas downstairs are spacious, inside and out, and very accommodating.

When people go on a vacation to Hawaii what they really hope for is a chance to totally relax, play, laugh, and smile and feel re-energized by a comfortable reminder that life is good.  Megan truly enjoys having guests in her home, and she will treat you like you are friends and family and not a mere \"customer.\"  She radiates an inner happiness that is pretty well in tune with the joy of life, and she just naturally enjoys sharing that feeling with everyone that she meets.  \n\nWhen I stayed there with my son, right after we walked in the door after a long car ride from the other side of the island, Megan shared some jumbo shrimp off her stove that she had cooked for herself, and then handed me a cold beer, which is her way of making friends very quickly and make me instantly feel pretty comfortable and right at home.  After a comfortable night sleeping there, I woke up the next morning and went for a nice bike ride on the beach with a beach cruiser bike that Megan will lend you.  Then I tried some of Megan's home-made ice coffee and her super-healthy and delicious home-made breakfast juice which had kale, carrot juice, and apple juice that she made in her juicer, and she also took the time to cook my son and I a pretty fantastic hot breakfast that was gourmet quality, nutritious and delicious.  Megan also enjoys arts \u0026 crafts and she handed me one of her custom home-made hula hoops, and says \"give this a try,\" which was something that I hadn't tried since I was about 12 years old.  She also gave my son and I our own private yoga lesson on the yoga mats in her back yard, and that was a pretty good way to start out the day.  \n\nMegan is a spiritual person, and all around her house are reminders of her mantra's that she wants to always remind herself of each day, as well as sharing a positive energy with those she meets.  It is like staying at the house of Norman Vincent Peale, the author of \"The Power of Positive Thinking\" books.  \n\nStaying in a hotel room seems a little dull in comparison because a room is really just a room.  Staying at Megan's house is more than that... it is a pretty high level of extra attention to Megan People Happy and creating an overall experience that is fun, relaxing, and healthy."},{"_id":"193505406","date":{"$date":"2017-09-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11464859","reviewer_id":"63199066","reviewer_name":"Angela","comments":"Megan's lilac room was a lovely space with very much appreciated air-conditioning.

Her house is only a 5 minute walk to the beach and about a 8-16 minute drive to Kailua-Kona main town (depending on traffic). Megan is lovely and she even surprised us with smoothies one morning.

Both Megan \u0026 Jake were very open and inviting, as well as the neighbors. I highly reccomend staying at the Megan Love House.

Many of the apartment blocks are only 5-6 floors high, not common in Hong Kong these days. The area is unique and renowned for the eateries at street level. There is a walkway at the end of the street to Victoria Park and to Tin Hau, another popular eating area. Causeway Bay shopping Centre is within walking distance.","notes":"I am happy to chat via email prior to your stay to help you plan and prepare for your time in Hong Kong Regarding the floor levels: The apartment is officially named as 4/26 Wun Sha. This means it is on the 4th floor (as per British numbering of floors) but the Chinese character outside the apartment door shows it as 5th floor (as per Chinese way of numbering floors). It is 26 as it is on the left of the stairwell - 28 is to the right. You'll know it by the plants by the door as well.","transit":"The MTR in Hong Kong is excellent, providing regular and easy access around the city. The Tin Hau station is a 6-7 minute walk. Buses are available at the end of the street, at a nearby terminus and on several surrounding streets, making travel around Hong Kong very easy. Taxis are also available and cheap.","access":"This is the entire apartment. Guests staying have full access to all amenities As this is my private home, and only hosted when I am away, I ask that the space is respected and cared for as a home. Check in \u0026 out is often flexible - bur needs coordination with a friend who takes care of my home while I'm away.","interaction":"I am happy to advise and chat with guests about the many options of things to do in Hong Kong. Hong Kong is a vibrant and busy city and guests will find they have easy access to areas of Hong Kong. I am happy to help to make your stay as comfortable as possible - to either share my 'local' knowledge of the city or to let you explore with maps and a sense of adventure.","house_rules":"Appreciate no smoking inside the building. I've never had a problem in my 8 years of hosting this apartment - all guests have been extrememly respectful of the space and items in it. Few details to help maintain the 'pest free' and comfort of my home: 1. Please keep the 3 sink holes covered \u0026 closed when not in use.  I have no cockroaches etc and ask that drains remain covered to ensure my home remains this way. 2. Walter filter. Water is drinkable from the tap. If you choose to use the filter - please ensure it is only filtered with COLD water. The hot water ruins the filter. 3. Hot water: please leave OFF when not in use - prevents high power costs. It is electric so it'll need 3-5 minutes to hear prior to a shower  4: When going out for the day, or leaving, please ensure the following is turned off: water heater, air-conditioners, lights \u0026 coffee machine. (\u0026 sink holes closed/covered) 5. When leaving, please ensure the door is locked (seems crazy, but many forget this!)","property_type":"Apartment","room_type":"Entire home/apt","bed_type":"Real Bed","minimum_nights":"2","maximum_nights":"1125","cancellation_policy":"strict_14_with_grace_period","last_scraped":{"$date":"2019-03-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"calendar_last_scraped":{"$date":"2019-03-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"first_review":{"$date":"2016-04-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"last_review":{"$date":"2018-02-25T05:00:00.000Z"},"accommodates":3,"bedrooms":2,"beds":2,"number_of_reviews":11,"bathrooms":{"$numberDecimal":"1.0"},"amenities":["TV","Cable TV","Internet","Wifi","Air conditioning","Kitchen","Smoke detector","Essentials","Hangers","Iron","translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_50","Host greets you"],"price":{"$numberDecimal":"761.00"},"cleaning_fee":{"$numberDecimal":"250.00"},"extra_people":{"$numberDecimal":"200.00"},"guests_included":{"$numberDecimal":"3"},"images":{"thumbnail_url":"","medium_url":"","picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/7ce28bfa-4754-4ca6-b9cc-24a01db09b67.jpg?aki_policy=large","xl_picture_url":""},"host":{"host_id":"1946293","host_url":"https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/1946293","host_name":"Su","host_location":"Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand","host_about":"I'm a Kiwi now living in NZ\r\nI have spent time living, working and travelling in Hong Kong - experiences that have built my love of travel.\r\nI work as a counsellor in a school and in an agency.\r\nI enjoy walking, biking, going to the theatre or movies, enjoying a good coffee and spending time with my family (whom I actually like) and my friends (whom I also like!).","host_thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/473fc63d-d036-4b8a-bd5a-199f89ddc095.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","host_picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/473fc63d-d036-4b8a-bd5a-199f89ddc095.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","host_neighbourhood":"Causeway Bay","host_is_superhost":false,"host_has_profile_pic":true,"host_identity_verified":false,"host_listings_count":2,"host_total_listings_count":2,"host_verifications":["email","phone","google","reviews","jumio","offline_government_id","government_id"]},"address":{"street":"Tai Hang (Causeway Bay), Hong Kong Island, Hong Kong","suburb":"Causeway Bay","government_area":"Wan Chai","market":"Hong Kong","country":"Hong Kong","country_code":"HK","location":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[114.19243,22.27928],"is_location_exact":true}},"availability":{"availability_30":0,"availability_60":0,"availability_90":0,"availability_365":0},"review_scores":{"review_scores_accuracy":10,"review_scores_cleanliness":10,"review_scores_checkin":10,"review_scores_communication":10,"review_scores_location":10,"review_scores_value":9,"review_scores_rating":98},"reviews":[{"_id":"67932750","date":{"$date":"2016-04-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11533406","reviewer_id":"60845717","reviewer_name":"Mike","comments":"Very comfortable apartment, perfect for what we needed.

I stayed here for 44 nights and she cleaned maybe one time before we arrived there. And the host got 50EUR for cleaning fee. In Barcelona, average fee for one-hour-full-cleaning is 10EUR. That means, with that money, actually I could call the cleaning lady for 5 hours. And was it clean? Not at all. She just pretend she cleaned (or maybe just organized a bit) but actually every corner I could find dust everywhere. And AMAZINGLY, she asked us 7EUR for each person for linen service. She said it includes sheets, pillow cover, table sheet, and serviettes. What kind of tourists is bringing their own sheets and table covers?? Don't you think of course it has to be included on the huge money I already paid? More than 1700Euros for 44nights? I think it is ridiculous and she knows that we are tourists and we don't know how it is going on exactly and tried to steal our money with any ways she can try. When we were looking for the flats, there were barely left the places and we didn't have choices and we were desperate so paid 14EUR for that. (One more thing here, this place was left until the last moment . Hope you know what it means) But there was even no serviettes and only blanket and pillow cover. And the facility. INCREDIBLY old and it looks that she doesn't live there so she doesn't care at all. The washing machine never closes the door maybe you need to try 1000 times. And I sent her a message for help and her answer was 'try gently again'. If she got money then she needs to serve proper services with that money. The facility is not only old but also not working. The host only thinks about money without helps for the money. This is the chat about paying the rest money when I did not know the cash paying is not allowed. Finally we asked Airbnb to explain her about the money.\nLast but not least, The house has Wifi.\nBut, most of time it doesn't work. And only one small tiny place works very seldomly. That's why we coudln't do anything in the house, we should find somewhere else for Wifi. It was terrible....."}]}

Our homes are intended for the enjoyment of our resident guests and not as a gathering spot for parties or events. This is in order to honor and respect the neighbors - we take pride in being great neighbors!

The pictures were very accurate, so they were no surprises there. This part of Brooklyn is what New York is all about, a real mix, I would recommend it to anyone that is deciding between staying in  Manhattan or elsewhere outside the big apple. Jon has been very responsive throughout the period we secure the property. Even when his oven stopped working - which was a big deal for us - he told us in advance and managed to secure an alternative, which we finally decided not to use (hope that's ok Jon). My only comment that I think could improve anyone's stay in the future is a mini map of the house pointing to where the basics are, what to use and what not to. It is almost self intuitive, but for someone that was using the service for the first time, I had lots of questions at the very beginning. Can I use this?, do you mind if we eat that?, in any case as I said Jon was always very responsive despite being away in the busiest annual holiday of the year."},{"_id":"92537116","date":{"$date":"2016-08-09T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1155475","reviewer_id":"7935714","reviewer_name":"Marc","comments":"Overall a terrific experience.

First, Jon's house is in an excellent location- there is plenty to do within walking distance (grocery stores, restaurants, and even the Barclay's center), plus the connection to public transport is outstanding- there are a few stops within a 5-10min walk, leaving you with tons of local / express train options. We traveled to Manhattan every day and never spent more than 30min on the train. Additionally, the house is huge and never felt small with six of us there. The kitchen is big enouch to cook a modest meal, and the dining / living rooms are perfect places for larger groups to reconnect after a day of activities. There's also two full bathrooms, so just a tiny bit of planning prevents any bathroom scheduling conflics.\n\nThe main thing that keeps this from being a perfect rental is the sleeping arrangements- there is really only one real bed suitable for two people. There's a second queen bed in the listing that can accommodate two people, but it's only a sofa-bed in the 2nd floor study (separated from the main bedroom by a curtain). The 3rd and 4th bedrooms on the 3rd floor have twin beds which, though more comfortable than the sofa-bed, will always feel like two separate beds even when pushed together. Families or groups with people desiring individual beds will be fine here (the top two bedrooms would be perfect for a few kids or friends bunking together to save money), but you if your party has more than one couple, you might consider other options.\n\nAll things considered, this property is a pretty good value- it's a huge place that can accommodate many people, and it's in a perfect location. However, if I were to return for a similar trip, I'd only consider a return visit if at least one more queen+ bed was added."},{"_id":"219485148","date":{"$date":"2017-12-17T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1155475","reviewer_id":"15667184","reviewer_name":"Jeffron","comments":"Impeccable home in a great location, really accessible to all areas of Manhattan and Long Island.

Fort Greene is a also a great neighborhood itself with lots of shopping options, the park and the BAM. The house itself is very nice, arranged over three floors with a large yard on a quite street. Check in was completely painless and Jon was super responsive when we had an issue with internet.\nOverall it's a great house and a unique experience to pretend to live in such a coveted neighborhood. However, I ended up paying about 800 per nigh because it was the holiday season and I am going to write a review based on this price. \nThere are a few things that COULD BE IMPROVED though. First, I somehow convinced that this would be a house in which Jon lives but this is not his primary residence. As a result, the house feels like a rental with older furniture and rather empty (plates and most cups are made of plastic for example, and I doubt anyone would live like that). \nApart from salt and a few spices, it was hard to find something to cook with so we had to buy pretty much everything to make French Toasts in the morning for the kids. It would have even nice to find sugar or syrup for example. Other than that, the kitchen is rather well equipped with pans and a nice gas range.\nFinally, my main sore point is about comfort. Were were two adult couples and two young kids. Kids slept very well and had basically all of the third floor for themselves, including a private bath with a tub. This was great!! The master bedroom was spacious and quiet and the bed was ok. However, the second bedroom was not so comfortable and rather small. Two nights were probably the most we could take in it. The bathroom is great though: excellent water pressure, hot water for everyone.\nAlso, as we were about to check in, Jon let us know that the washer was broken. This was of course not a problem but I believe that it had prevented the cleaning person to wash the linens, which smelled like someone else had slept in them. The towels also smelled moldy. It's pretty clear that all were thrown in the dryer without a wash and I would have preferred if we were told about this."},{"_id":"225798768","date":{"$date":"2018-01-07T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1155475","reviewer_id":"41338016","reviewer_name":"Guannan","comments":"Jon is an outstanding host.

We navigated the subway with our 4 children and managed! \nThe 4 bedroom/ 3 level brownstone home is stylish, spacious and very comfortable. We never felt cramped as a family of 6 even once. The local  area felt safe and friendly. Jon provides a pack and play porta cot and even went out and purchased a stroller for us to use during our stay so we had a spare one for our 3 year old who wouldn’t cope with all the walking in NY. This was incredibly thoughtful and generous of the host so we could avoid expensive hire charges and having to wait in for a hire stroller to be delivered. \nHighly recommend Jon’s house for families looking to live like a local\nfor a few days.

The room itself was super clean, comfortable and perfect for a short holiday in Hong Kong. It had everything I needed - AC, little bathroom with shower, fresh towel everyday, shampoo and a big comfortable bed. You also feel really safe as you can only get into the guesthouse and room with a special keycard. The staff was super helpful too and so was Natalie. I only met her in person once, but she is incredibly friendly and really makes sure you have a pleasant stay.

The attendants are very nice and do the best efforts to communicate with you, despite of not speaking good English. If you want to work in the bedroom is not a good place, as you do not have a table. But Hong-Kong Polytechnic University is a few minutes far, so you can use a library there if you need. It's what you get in a good neighborhood for a good price in a city where real estate market is very expensive.\n\nIn my experience Natalie answered me fast by (Hidden by Airbnb) when I needed her, and the attendants were nice, gave me some fruits and also an umbrella for the rain as presents. The only problem I had was, for my fault, I lost the bedroom key card on a beach. As the place has a reception and you have to do a 100 HK dollars deposit to have the key, I was expecting them to immediately have an extra one, even if I would lose my money. A lady who worked in the hotel but was in her bedroom (not in the reception) could open my bedroom with a master key when I arrived but I had to wait until the next morning to have another key. As the lady went back to her room to sleep and I had no more key I could not go out that night and the other day I got my new key only after leaving and arriving again. It was not that bed, but it's just an alert to be attent with your key and an improvement the place can do. \n\nFor the rest, I was so glad to be hosted there that I came back to the same place the following week to take another night in HK. I think this is the best indicative I found it really worthwhile.\n\nHope to help you all with these comments."},{"_id":"289247587","date":{"$date":"2018-07-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11557363","reviewer_id":"85229184","reviewer_name":"Aziz","comments":"You'll literally get what you pay for.

It was crowded and noisey and didn't feel safe. When we got up in the morning all things were different, everybody in the street was kind and greeted each other. But hey, you're in New York!\r\n\r\nThe restaurants in the neighborhood are great. Go for a meal to Peaches or Saraghina's, go for a delicious slice of pizza to Daddy Green's on Malcolm X and chill out with a glass of wine at Therapy. Definitely more laid back than in Manhattan. \r\n\r\nThe only thing we would prefer is some carpet of a rug in the backside of their upper apartment. We are both medium sleepers and we woke up every morning when they and their son woke up, who is adorable though.\r\n\r\nIn the end we had a great stay for a reasonable price!!

We kindly went up to ask to keep it down as the kitchen is obviously right above the bedroom he was super rude and tried telling us no one was up. But then the next day said he was up at that time. They obviously have no idea how loud it really is. And to be disturbed every single night. Who is up at 1am clashing dishes around honestly.\r\nThen you can never sleep in and make up for the broken sleep as the child is up screaming running and thudding so loud at 7am \r\n\r\nDay 5 Alex come down as someone was knocking on out door apparently to check the electricals \r\nNo warning just entered and barged straight through the door and I had just gotten out of the shower. Again massive invasion of privacy!\r\nOur last night we thought we would get a proper rest for once before our flight, to my surprise wheelie bins were being dragged and rubbish bags going through it was so loud I thought there was a homeless person rummaging through the trash, nope just Alex at 1230 in the morning making more noise right out our window.\r\n\r\nI think it was becoming entertainment for him haha such a joke I have honestly never experienced anything like this and if I had read a review that explained how noisy it was from above and that you can literally hear word for word the conversations had I would have passed straight past the ad."},{"_id":"63588606","date":{"$date":"2016-02-24T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1155885","reviewer_id":"24125542","reviewer_name":"Cindy","comments":"We found and booked this listing within the same week of our visit.

Although we didn't get to meet our hosts, they were still very much involved in ensuring that our stay was comfortable. Every concern we had was addressed within the hour.\r\n\r\nThe apt has such a simple and carefree personality.

The apt is located in a nice neighborhood with lots of markets, coffee hops and restaurants. Prior to our stay Alex sent us a detailed email about where to go and what to do during our stay. It was so helpful and we referred back to it a lot! \n\nThe only thing that was a minor set back was the noise. Upstairs and outside... It was super loud. Luckily, we are used to it because we live in an 100 year old apt in a busy neighborhood back home, but I could see it being an issue for someone not used to it. Shalia and Alex do provide earplugs though, so that I can imagine would be helpful. \n\nOther then that, Alex is very, VERY good at communication! He responded to me quickly when I asked if we could leave our bags longer on our last day! We were so happy about the flexibility of him letting us do that and quick response!\n\nThanks again for hosting a great experience for us!

Noise travels very easily in the apartment and we therefore struggled to sleep past 8/9am most mornings. \r\n\r\nWe also had an unannounced visit despite being told notice would be given in advance if access to the basement was needed. Shaila and Alex thought we were out (but we were in bed) and came into the flat 2 seconds after knocking. No notice was given, if it had we would have been ok with it as this is what it states in the description. \r\n\r\nThe wifi is also pretty poor. When staying you are a guest on their home network and they have obviously limited the connection. We did message them and they tried to fix it but if you are looking to stream anything it means a lot of buffering. The network also kicks you of periodically. \r\n"},{"_id":"91571926","date":{"$date":"2016-08-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1155885","reviewer_id":"11290604","reviewer_name":"Sunny","comments":"We really enjoyed our stay here.

The house was easy to find and we were lucky to get parking right in front. Word to the wise, the street does have scheduled times for street cleaning during the week but there are plenty of signs. We emailed Shaila and Alex with questions about parking as well, just to be sure, and they were very prompt with a response. The private entrance is nice and really makes you feel like you're in your own home. Check in was extremely easy. We didn't have much face to face contact until the last day but we'll get to that.\n\nAnyway, we were pleasantly surprised by the space. We were offered a nice couch, a spacious kitchen area with a fridge for our many leftovers, a bedroom with a comfortable bed and lots of pillows, and a bathroom with a functioning and clean shower. The only thing we wanted for was a tv but we figured we were on vacation so it was like a blessing in disguise. The decor was nice and the place was warm and clean. The neighborhood was about how you would expect it. Nice and affordable places to eat and a lovely coffee shop nearby that made the most delicious Nutella lattes. Peaches offers amazing fried chicken, the pizza (BKLYN I think it was called) was shockingly great and arrived quickly. Access to the subway was about a 10 minute walk so nothing too extreme. \n\nOn our last day, however, Stella decided she was going to dump snow all over the city. We were in a rush to get the car packed and head out before the city went into total lockdown mode and accidentally locked ourselves out of the apartment. Another piece of advice, the door locks behind you automatically. I'm sure we could've fixed that but for security purposes, it seemed like a smart decision on Alex and Shaila's part. What could've ended terribly was a very easy fix. Maybe it was because they were snowed in but both offered assistance and we were out on the road in no time! They were even kind enough to warn us the day before (via email) that we were going to get hit with a snow storm and expressed concern that we were planning to drive through it. Nice people, great place, just remember that a family lives upstairs so try to keep the noise down (they never said anything about noise but just as a courtesy).

We enjoyed our stay. Some downfalls were the upstairs noise and the outside rowdiness, but we were given ear plugs, which was a nice thought. The neighborhood can be questionable at night, although no one bothered us, we were very cautious walking about. Not sure if it was us or the machine, but not until our last night, the AC wouldn't cool down below 74. This sounds cool, but on a day where it reached 90, we woke up sweating. The location is close to public transportation and little cafes. About a 40 minutes ride to time square and 30 minutes to Williamsburg area. The bed was very comfortable and the sheets were the softest I've ever felt! Would recommend.

We needed up falling in love with the area and got to see a side of NYC living that we would have missed if we had stayed in the city. Alex was so great- he answered all our questions and gave us great recommendations for places to eat (please don’t miss Saraghina- their pizza was the best we’ve ever had). We even got to be there for a neighborhood block party which was really fun to see. The trip into the city was not bad at all. They house is near a subway station.

Titi was prompt to reply to my queries when booking the place and also remained available throughout my stay. Titi had left some space in the drawers so I could unpack and I had the fridge to put my week's supplies. It felt very homely. Wifi also worked very well.

It was the basement of their home with a lot of space and a half bathroom. Really relaxing experience with all the privacy you want, a large TV with Netflix and Amazon  for those who like to watch a nice movie when coming back from a long day in New York. The photos on airbnb are not really capturing how nicely decorated and well kept is the room. Nothing compared to other rooms I have seen in Astoria. The towels provided are of very good quality and very large, the wi-fi works perfectly and there is plenty of space for your things. To me and after seeing a lot of rooms, there is no doubt that this one is the best taking into consideration the space provided, the location and the price asked!\r\nThe neighborhood was again really pretty. Very safe with lots of shops for food and interesting markets. I had the feeling and really wanted to go back to Astoria and walk around after a busy day in Manhattan. 4min walk to 30th station and 16 min ride to Lex avenue and the upper east side which in my opinion is the best area in NY \r\nI can't say enough about Gabe and his mum. Their hospitality was awesome! I was welcomed with a lot of snacks, fruits and a bottle of wine waiting for me when I arrived and kept coming during my stay. Gabe was answering immediately to all my texts and tried to sort out anything I needed in order to feel more at home! But besides that the most important thing is that both of them are very interesting and well educated people. You can have a lot of discussions about lots of things and learn, which at least for me is very important! I think I made some friends in NYC, which by the way is a truly amazing city.\r\nHighly recommended, no need to look anywhere else!

Paid short and long term parking available 2 blocks away.

Excellent location if you prefer a quiet neighborhood. There is quite a number of restaurants and shops close by and it is only two blocks away to Central Park. Public transportation is within walkable distance too. \nPlease note that you will need to buy some necessities such as trash bags, shampoos and so on as this is not an apartment that someone currently lives in (more of a hotel style with an empty furnished room). Also the streets could be a little loud at night because it faces to Madison Avenue. The service calls were handled promptly.

First, there are cockroaches. First thing we saw upon entering were cockroaches in the kitchen area - without even having any food around or cooking. This was not properly disclosed before arrival. Although they sent somebody over who laid out baits, the roaches did not disappear. Second, (at least) two times there were unannounced strangers entering the apartment in order to look at it or to even take pictures. We know because we were at the apartment at this time. Third, the apartment faces Madison Ave, so it is rather loud. In addition, the windows are not well sealed so it gets cold/hot easily. Overall, considering what you get, the apartment is overpriced.

We love the scenic route that David suggested going back to Kona Kailua.

He checked in with me as our trip approached and had a very detailed list of instructions on how to find the place - it was super easy. We actually flew into Kona and when I texted David upon landing he even sent me tips of what to see along our drive over to Volcano. The house was easy to find and very accessible. It was super clean, and super spacious. The kitchen was fully stocked with kitchen equipment and David supplied plenty of other items such as cleaning items, towels, wash clothes, soap, shampoo, etc. One of my favorite parts was that David had maps and recommendations of everything in Volcano- from restaurant menus, activities, where to explore in the area, etc. By far the most prepared airbnb I've ever stayed in.

This is my favorite place I've stayed on any of the Hawaiian islands (and I lived on the Big Island for a year).\n\nCLEAN:\nSo very clean throughout. Bathroom looked new it was so sparkling. Kitchen, bedroom, living room, sheets, towels, pillows, everything was amazingly clean.\n\nHUGE SPACE:\nPlenty of room for 6 people to sleep. Huge kitchen with extra large dining room that seats 8! Plus a desk, couch and lots of places to hang out inside and out.\n\nAMAZINGLY THOUGHTFUL:\nThe house was filled with maps, local restaurant menus, hiking info, even a DVD of the volcano. It was great! David even has maps and info in tons of languages. He also has thoughtful signs, so the address is easy to spot, and you know where to park, which was especially great when arriving in the dark. Also the kitchen was stocked with coffee, tea, butter, condiments, microwave, toaster, clean utensils, etc. There were also games and things for kids to do, and there was wifi and David even provided Netflix. So thoughtful!\n\nPRIVATE:\nWe arrived very late, and the lockbox was easy to use. I loved that I didn't have to disturb anyone that late and night, and we could let ourselves in at our convenience. The ohana is in the back of the property with lots of trees all around. It's extremely quiet. Zero coquis. Just peaceful silence. Also, the curtains kept the ohana dark in the morning, which was perfect for sleeping in.\n\nGREAT COMMUNICATION:\nDavid was a joy to communicate with. Quick responses every time, very friendly and welcoming. We didn't meet face to face, but he was incredibly available via text and Airbnb messaging.\n\nOverall a great stay! I would love to bring my family back here, since it's a perfect home base to explore the Volcano National Park from. And so much more private and serene than a large hotel.\n\nMahalo nui loa for everything, David!"},{"_id":"216949681","date":{"$date":"2017-12-06T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11610598","reviewer_id":"19655414","reviewer_name":"Akyra","comments":"If you plan on visiting Volcano National Park this is the place to stay.

Two full beds in the bedroom, a queen sized sofa bed, and an air bed available by request. Bright and beautiful, with a DVD player and nice video library. Dave also had maps of Hawaii, guidebooks, suggested destinations, and local tips posted in the entryway.\n\nSadly, our schedule was such that we arrived late and left early.

This is your place.  (Just left as the VOLCANO WAS ERUPTING, THIS PLACE IS SAFE!    The volcano is ONLY affecting 5% of the island, you are fine)!    We took our 7 and 3yo to Dave's place, and the place is beyond kid friendly.   Board games, kid books, and kid art bin!   My little found the plastic spider in the play bin and was ecstatic to scare older brother the whole time.   David responded within 10 minutes each time I sent a message, and when he asked if 7yo had found Lava Rock souvenir, I replied no.. in 3 minutes I saw him OUTSIDE hunting rocks for him!  We went outside and got a 45 min rock/lava seminar from him.  He is a BIOLOGIST!    My nerd kid was excited to find rocks and ask Dave \"what is this\"?    His wife went and captured a lizard for the 3yo to see.   The space:  is perfect for 4-5 people.    Toddler highchair in the kitchen!   Soap, shampoo/cond in the bath, fridge was stocked with some necessities (plus a nice bonus),  desk with outlets to charge and work on a computer, TV has no cable, but movies \u0026 DVD player there.  ABUNDANT island info, maps everywhere, maps on the wall with notes, and books to read about the island on the desk!    Do you like earthquakes?   Over 100 a day right now, we felt everything OVER a 3.0, and apparently slept thru the 5.8.  They are rolling, not jerky!  My7yo LOVED to experience this!    Dave found us an outlook to see the eruption on Fissure 8- at night it was gorgeous!   WIFI available for my kids tablets.   NOTE: Head to the grocery store BEFORE you head up!  There is a Foodland on the way up Highway 11- food prices up in Volcano are EXPENSIVE!  Stock up then head up the hill.   This place is 2 miles to the CLOSED Volcano park, and 40 minutes down to Hilo.    We drove more south to the amazing bakery and Black Sand Beach.  Sadly we could not enjoy the hikes in the closed park, but can't wait to come back one day!   We then left and went onto Kona for 7 days.

The Kitchen was fully equipped, everything was sparkling clean. \nDavid is very knowledgeable about the region and Volcano NP and was happy to share his knowhow with us.  \nWe would definitively return."},{"_id":"306622756","date":{"$date":"2018-08-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11610598","reviewer_id":"156422447","reviewer_name":"Carmen","comments":"What a great find!! \nThe host (David)  is very pleasant \u0026 welcoming.

We (my sister and I) were there for only one night and came in late, but David's directions were perfect (the rock wall confirms that you are at the right place) and the ohana was a cinch to find, even after dark on a very dark street! Easy entrance to a warm inviting room with a comfy sofa, a desk to set up your laptop, a large dining table, a very nice kitchen area with all of the appliances that you'll need and that all-essential item (for us, anyway) of coffee for the morning. This would be an ideal place for a family with young children, as there's a high chair and children's books, dvds, toys and games - dvds and games for adults as well. We instantly felt at home. The ohana worked for us very well with the two queen beds, but it's suitable for really any kind of group up to 5. The bathroom is well-stocked and there are plenty of towels; the temperature in the ohana was perfect for sleeping with the warm comforters on the beds.  There was a very useful book with menus of all of the local restaurants; the only one we had time to try was the Tuk Tuk Thai truck which was very good. We also went to the Volcano Winery and had a great time chatting with the staff plus trying their excellent wines ($5 for a flight of 7 wines, generously poured tastings). Our favorite was the pinot noir, but enjoyed all of them. A few minutes to the national park and David has the latest info on what trails are currently open, which was very helpful; note that at this time, most of the trails are NOT open. Lastly, when I had a last-minute semi-emergency back home and needed to call a number of people about the issue, my sister messaged David and he responded immediately and generously, allowing us to check out a half hour late. Excellent choice!"},{"_id":"338905662","date":{"$date":"2018-10-20T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11610598","reviewer_id":"161063703","reviewer_name":"Janet","comments":"David’s Ohana was amazing!

Thank you for doing this David! Check in and check out was easy-peazy (because his directions were very clear and accurate).   The place was clean.  It felt safe.   It was easy to find.  It was close to Hilo and the National Volcano Park.  My room mates enjoyed the wifi. The parking spot right outside the door of this private guest house was super handy.  Would we stay there again?

The apartment's located within a 5 minute walk to many restaurants and bars as well as a 10 minute walk to the beach. The Leblon neighborhood is very safe and the building is also very secure (security guard during the day, tall gate out front, several doors to unlock in order to get into the building). Compared to Ipanema and Copacabana, the neighborhood is quieter and less touristy which made our Rio experience feel more authentic. The only downside is that the apartment is a tight squeeze if you have more than 3-4 people. We had a total of 5 girls and found that the apartment really only slept 4 \"comfortably.\" The bedroom has an AC unit but the main area where the two sofa beds are located only has a fan. We were there during the height of the summer and whoever slept on the couch directly across from the TV had minimal air flow (the fan is directly above the first couch when you enter). While having the patio door opened helped a little, there was not much of a breeze due to the high walls on the patio. I would say that during the cooler months, the apartment sleeps 4 comfortably but during the summer only 3. Other than the air circulation/sleeping arrangement issues I would highly recommend this apartment due to its ideal location. Silvia is also a great host - she was very responsive and was super flexible with our check-in time. Overall we really enjoyed our stay in Rio at Silvia's!"},{"_id":"61420853","date":{"$date":"2016-02-04T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1163119","reviewer_id":"31792371","reviewer_name":"Michèle","comments":"Choosing Silvia's apartment was easy, because it reminded me of those lofts in Europe. It's very well decorated, bright, confortable and had all the amenities necessary for my 3 week stay. \r\nI travelled by myself from Perth, Australia, after 5 years away from Rio, to visit one of my sons, granddaughter and friends.  Leblon is the perfect place to be for holidays or business, and this apartment is 3 short blocs away from the beach, while supermarket, amazing bakeries, restaurants, \"lanchonetes\", are just around the corner, 1 to 5 minutes away.  \r\nThe one bedroom apartment is exactly how t's described, on the street level of an old building and has a very charming terrace. During the day, there are two nice gentlemen, \"porteiros\", who take care of the entrance and us :). They keep the building safe and very clean. At night, the residents and I had the appropriate keys to lock the main gate outside and the main building door. Very safe building and apartment. I did not have any issues and all the residents were very kind and polite. Brazilians are amazing people. \r\nLeblon is also very central, close to Ipanema  and Gávea (both walking distance), Copacabana, Barra da Tijuca, the city and many touristic attractions. \r\nSilvia was fantastic since the begining. She always answered promply my emails, even with the 11 hours difference between Australia and Brazil. She was at the apartment at my arrival to give me informations, details about internet etc. Superb!\r\nSheets and towels were changed every week without a problem and I only had a problem with the internet once, which Silvia came to the apartment straight away and we discovered that I had disconected the wrong plug out of the wall. My mistake! \r\nI will definetly go back to the same place in the near future with my husband and adult son. \r\nThank you Silvia. \r\nMuito obrigada, um beijo e até breve.\r\nMichèle"},{"_id":"62097300","date":{"$date":"2016-02-11T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1163119","reviewer_id":"55470365","reviewer_name":"Mauricio","comments":"Apartamento bom, de forma geral, e com localização muito boa. \r\nPonto para melhoria: Ar condicionado do quarto que é muito antigo, barulhento e não funciona bem.\r\nSilvia e marido estiveram à disposição para ajudar no necessário.\r\nRecomendaria para até no máximo 3 pessoas.\r\n"},{"_id":"63927274","date":{"$date":"2016-02-28T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1163119","reviewer_id":"4041204","reviewer_name":"Jonathan \u0026 Janie","comments":"Both Silvia and the apartment were great!

Fun and funky decor, nice little terrace and ktichen.  Couple of things: 1)  there are two bathrooms- one with toilet, the other with sink and bathtub.  The sink drained realy slowly so was a little discouraging.  Shower was fine, water pressure a little low.  2) our room, the Green Room, is right on St. Denis - trucks ROARing woke us early a.m.  3) be sure to take your room key with you when you go to the bathroom, etc, otherwise your door will lock!

So close to Laurier metro station, this bnb is the perfect way to simulate how the locals live in this beautiful city.  Jen was a great host, she pops in everyday to make sure everything is ok in the house and you'll hopefully get to meet some fantastic guests as I did.  If I ever go back to Montreal I will definitely stay her as you feel like you're living in someone's house and the owner isn't home :)\r\n\r\nIf you are a light sleeper I would strongly recommend asking for the back bedroom or the one in the middle (it doesn't have any windows so if you're a fresh air freak that might be something to take into consideration).  I had the large room at the front and it was massive; I sleep with ear plugs and a couple of nights the traffic kept me awake, but overall I loved staying here 100%.\r\n\r\nDirection from the metro - when you get off the tube (if heading north on Montmorency direction) go towards the exit that doesn't have stairs visible.  There'll be an escalator and then a flight of stairs and exit at the Gilford doors.  As you look right this is the bus stop, I think they terminate here and it looks like a dead end street.  There's a street that veers off to the left and at the end there's some traffic lights (you'll walk past some restaurants on the left, a pizza joint on the corner on the right), when you're standing next to the pizza place, cross over the road (across the 4 lanes, not the crossing that flows with the traffic) and the door is basically right there in front of the lights.  There's no sign indicating the name of the bnb, just keep an eye out for the door as it's a bit hard to see at first.  It's in between the shops and I walked past it the first time."},{"_id":"2615910","date":{"$date":"2012-10-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"116931","reviewer_id":"3549880","reviewer_name":"Tom","comments":"This is a nice place to stay.

The description of the place is accurate, no frills. The neighborhood is THE BEST part about this place.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that caught us by surprise is that the toilet and the rest of the bathroom are in two different rooms. So at one point I wasn't able to use the bathroom to wash my hands after using the toilet because someone was in there...but that only happened once.\r\n\r\nAnd one thing that was slightly irksome for me personally was one of the pillows that had little support, but I'm also used to thick, fluffy pillows, sometimes stacking one top of the other; so take this part of the review in with a grain of salt.\r\n\r\nWe were really looking to just crash for the night and take in Montreal as much as we can, so we weren't in the house very much.

We had an amazing time and had everything we needed for a brilliant stay in NYC. The subway is 5 mins walk and 25 minutes to Times Square. Leafy suburban quiet street , friendly neighbours and plenty of amenities nearby. If you are up to it you can even use citibikes from the end of the road and ride across the Brooklyn Bridge into Manhattan. Cycle paths all the way. Checkin/checkout times were extremely flexible which really helped us as we arrived at 8am and didn't leave until 11pm but our host was fabulous and was waiting when we arrived and allowed us to stay later on the day we went home.

We were met at the door and Sal (Luis) showed us around. The kitchen is stocked (sugar, coffee, some spices) and the refrigerator had almond milk and pasteles (a sort of Puerto Rican tamale). He made suggestions about local food--especially the very inexpensive and killer roasted chicken just around the corner. Also local are 2 big grocery stores and small stores featuring liquor, fruit, etc. The apartment is a short 5-6 blocks from the subway. We love the area. It's still the yet-to-be entirely gentrified end of Williamsburg, which means that the original neighborhood is still present while a few lovely coffee places are now available. Great new theatre in the other end of Williamsburg. For us--very exciting area. One future consideration is that the L subway will soon be out of commission for renovations, so if you don't have a car, you would need good bus directions. One other thought: the 2nd bedroom is downstairs with no window."},{"_id":"223603627","date":{"$date":"2018-01-01T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11693193","reviewer_id":"71806827","reviewer_name":"Julia","comments":"Quite spacious, very convenient location, close to tubes.

The facilities were fantastic and we enjoyed using the pool (which is also a lot bigger in person) which has stunning views over Rio, including Christ the Redeemer on Corcovado mountain. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and learnt our faces immediately so we had no problem at all gaining access to the very secure apartment (the staff buzz you in the gates via CCTV). The neighbourhood is more downtown Rio and if you like a good night out it will be perfect for you. We didn't feel that the neighbourhood was the safest of areas in Rio, but then again anywhere in Rio during the night isn't the safest place to be. The noise from the street at night was sometimes a little loud especially on Fridays and Saturdays which are extremely busy times in Lapa however we understand that this noise is unavoidable and inevitable. It must also be taken into consideration that we were in Rio for the busiest two weeks of the year, during the 2016 Olympics, a time when at night there were hundreds of thousands of tourists on the streets as well as the locals! Despite this as soon as we entered the double electronic gated apartment block we felt completely at ease and safe and during or time in Rio we spent one of the day's exploring Lapa, admiring its arches and the colourful artwork and graffiti that the locality had to offer. The apartment was perfect for us, size, location, accessibility were all excellent. Our neighbours were very friendly and helpful and would always say \"good morning\" and \"good evening\" in the elevator throughout the day. There was a very convenient supermarket just 1 minutes  walk from the apartment and the kitchen had everything you could possible need. If however you prefer to eat out, Lapa has many excellent bars and restaurants and so does Copacabana and Ipanena if you want to travel a little further away. The shower was particularly excellent-hot water was always in abundance. This apartment had everything we wanted and we couldn't have asked for a better place to stay during our time spent in Rio De Janeiro for the Olympics. If and when we ever return to Rio Dejanira's apartment is the only option for us and we would love to stay there again."},{"_id":"103267553","date":{"$date":"2016-09-21T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11695437","reviewer_id":"67209131","reviewer_name":"Flávio","comments":"Excelente!

She responded to everything and does actually live close by (a good thing too, because the door code wasn't working when we arrived, but it was quickly addressed).  She was also helpful in giving us a bit of extra time for check-out.\n\nJust to say a couple things about the actual condo, the pictures do portray it in the best possible light.  Nothing deceptive, but there are elements that could use updating that are not shown.  The bathrooms need some TLC and there are lots of wires and cords everywhere (especially the bedrooms).  Everything else was clean and safe.  The kitchen is up-to-date with every appliance you should need, including a blender and toaster.  There is a newer washer and dryer right in the unit, which is very convenient.  We didn't use the TVs, but there are 3 of them - one in the main living room and one in each bedroom.  Parking was very convenient - a reserved spot that's just steps away from the ground level entrance (the condo is on the ground level and doesn't have any stairs).  There are several beach accessories waiting as well - a cooler, beach chairs and boogie boards are there for your use, along with plenty of beach towels.  There are 3 AC units and all of them worked, but they are noisy.\n\nThe noise level outside was generally good.  There were a few inconsiderate very early morning departures from other units, but nothing major.  The park across the road closes at 8pm, so there was no late-night noise to speak of.\n\nThe location in general is great.  The park across the road is not a swimming beach (no sand, too many rocks), but it's very popular for surfing and paddleboarding lessons.  There are several sandy beaches just a short drive (or healthy walk) away.  Kihei in general is a great spot to stay, as it's near several  great beaches (Big Beach in Makena is epic) and is central to a lot of things you'll want to see - the upscale Wailea area is just a short drive away and several other destinations are easily driveable from Kihei.  There are lots of food choices close by and many of them offer some of the best value you'll find in Maui.  There's also 2 supermarkets right down the road (and Foodland is open until 1am).\n\nTo summarize, the condo was more \"rustic\" than we were expecting, but I will say that in the area, you'd likely have to pay a bit more for something more updated that has 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms."},{"_id":"194080594","date":{"$date":"2017-09-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11695887","reviewer_id":"24734634","reviewer_name":"International Theatrical","comments":"Wonderful host great location"},{"_id":"202548198","date":{"$date":"2017-10-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11695887","reviewer_id":"78286024","reviewer_name":"Michael","comments":"Jennifer's place has everything you need in the perfect location. It was my first time in Maui, \u0026 I absolutely enjoyed it. Jennifer's place was literally right across the street from Kalama Beach Park \u0026 a very short walk (~10 min.) from Charley Young Beach. Her place is very centrally located in Kihei: directly next to the surf/paddleboard rental, 5 min. walking distance from a shopping village, \u0026 in the middle of the island, which is nice if you plan on doing the drives to Mt. Haleakala or the Road to Hana. Safeway is a short ~5 min. drive \u0026 Costco \u0026 the airport are a ~30 minute drive away. Her place has everything you need: kitchen, washer/dryer, beach towels/chairs, nice outdoor patio with a nice, small pool. I highly recommend her place if you want a quiet, quaint, peaceful place to relax where everything you need is a short distance away.

It might get a little louder due to the bars in der street which are literally right in front of the apartment but since we knew that beforehand and and have deep sleeps this wasn't a problem. Everything is within walking distance and the apartment was clean, well decorated and cozy. Please note that the bed is a loft bunk and that you have to climb up a ladder, however it is huge and very comfy. Check out the location before you go on (Hidden by Airbnb) maps as there was no number on the outside of the house and it thus might be confusing at first. Other than that we did not habe any problems. The communication with dulce in advance was great and she was even nicer in person. Would definitely book when we are in Porto again!

Silvia’s apartment is located in an upcoming neighbourhood near 2 subway stops which go directly into the city.  Add to this the fact that there is one of the best restaurants in the city nearby (Roberta’s (Website hidden by Airbnb) and you have yourself a winner.  You can’t beat the price and you can’t beat the hospitality.  We drove to NYC from Nova Scotia, and we were worried about street parking while we were there but once we arrived it was no problem finding a spot (right across the street from the apt.) and the neighbourhood was very safe.  Just be aware most spots have a 2 hour window twice a week when you have to move for street parking and you’ll be fine.  I’ve seen other comments about the noise in the neighbourhood but either we were too tired to notice or we’re more tolerant because it was never an issue for us.  If you’re looking to do NYC on a budget, Brooklyn is definitely the way to go. We would definitely stay here again."},{"_id":"699725","date":{"$date":"2011-11-07T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11708","reviewer_id":"898170","reviewer_name":"Mark","comments":"This is a modest but comfortable basement apartment, slightly cramped  (I'm 6'2\" and hit my head on a duct a few times, but I'm also a little clumsy!) but clean and quiet.

Then in order to get to the basement apartment you had to go through the garage (which I didn't mind too much) however, it was very crowded with miscellaneous items so you had to be careful coming and going.

We definitely enjoyed staying at Silvia's basement apartment in Brooklyn and would do it again! It was a good deal and Silvia was very nice and accommodating. Using the subway, it took us about 50 minutes to get to Times Square, 35 minutes to get to the financial district, 1 hour 40 minutes to get to LaGuardia airport (if you take a taxi, it costs about $34). The subway station is a few blocks from the apartment, about a 10 min walk. The neighborhood seems a bit sketchy and unsafe at first, but after staying there a while (often coming back late), I've found it to be pretty safe and every night, a police car would drive around. The place is exactly as you see in pictures, water was always hot, and the heater was effective, WiFi was fast, but the only thing that was a bit of a surprise to me was that the bedroom is the only room that you can lock off as your own. The bathroom and kitchen sink area are technically left open, as you don't get a key for these places, but I assume no one is really supposed to come down while we are staying there. Also, you can definitely hear the people upstairs walking and the pipes make some noise, but it didn't bother us too much as neither of us are light sleepers and we were always dead tired when we came back from the city. All in all, had a great experience and strongly recommend staying at Silvia's, especially if you want to save money on hotels!"},{"_id":"3482352","date":{"$date":"2013-02-05T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11708","reviewer_id":"4529780","reviewer_name":"Adam","comments":"We stayed in Silvia's apartment for 6 days.

We stayed for a looong time - 11 nights! The private entrance is accessed first into the foyer then through the garage, then down the stairs past the washer and we had no problems with coming in late nights. Partway through our stay some other people came to staying in the other unit she has upstairs and you could definitely hear them but nothing too bad. Shower is small, but again, everything was clean and functional (hot water, wifi, heater, etc.). Great to have the mini-fridge and there was also a toaster oven, electric kettle, coffee maker, etc. and we were able to do a quick load of laundry partway through the stay which was nice (I never heard anyone else doing laundry, but the machine is loud). There is a lock on the bedroom door but not to the main kitchen/bathroom area, though, again, we never saw anyone in the garage or laundry area and I don't expect anyone came into our area. Bed was fairly comfy - firm - and there are now nightstands on both sides of the bed. Lots of great stuff in the area and Silvia provides a binder and map of her favorite bars, restaurants and cultural activities in the area. Several different subway stations within easy walking distance. Would definitely stay again - if you're looking to stay in Brooklyn this is a great, affordable and convenient option."},{"_id":"4000171","date":{"$date":"2013-04-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11708","reviewer_id":"4961180","reviewer_name":"Hannah","comments":"All in all a very good experience staying at Silvia's.

We've never stayed in Bushwick before, usually preferring Brooklyn Heights. That area has become too pricey, so we took a chance on Bushwick, hearing it's become fun and eclectic and safer. It was all of that, plus friendly and felt safe.\n\nAbsolutely enjoyable area, more than enough coffee shops and restaurants to walk to, and we also walked a lot to nearby Williamsburg, with even more opportunities for great dining. \n\nSilvia and her family were wonderful; we enjoyed meeting her smart and charming daughter and her interesting artist husband, who maintains an art studio next-door that you can visit.\n\nThis basement apartment is reached through a narrow passageway in a full storage garage, which might be off-putting at first, but don't be fooled: you come down the stairs and into a clean, spacious and minimal apartment.  It is basic, but has everything you need. Extra toiletries, toaster oven, coffee maker, extra comforter, etc. \nThere's a groovy custom-made bench and iron table to sit at for a quick snack or some sightseeing planning.\n\nSilvia provides a three-ring binder with neighborhood menus and house rules. Try El Kucho, just on the next block, *great* Mexican \u0026 nice owners. At this time, they have not yet received their liquor license, but about five doors down on the same spot is a great wine store.  \nArchie's, a nearby bar and pizza spot is a great alternative to the 1-2 hour wait at famous Roberta's pizza.\n\nOne or two reviewers here have said that it was warm down there in the summer. The weather was cool during our visit, so we weren't too warm. The temperature was really perfect. There are two small windows in case you feel claustrophobic, but we never did. She has decorated it in a way that feels airy. At any rate, we were out of our room early and back late, enjoying Brooklyn!\n\nThe bed and pillows are quite firm, but we slept well. You are in a basement; expect upstairs noise. I am a very light sleeper, so I always bring earplugs; noise wasn't a problem.\n\nI don't see how anyone could get a better value in Brooklyn, so close to Brooklyn Heights. I doubt we will ever stay anywhere else again. I see myself coming back here year after year!\n"},{"_id":"51705665","date":{"$date":"2015-10-24T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11708","reviewer_id":"4990555","reviewer_name":"Lydia","comments":"Perfect inexpensive place to sleep and keep your things while spending time in Brooklyn/New York City.

The bedroom is just under their apartment so you hear the lovely kids jumping around in the morning :) The area is nice, very fancy restaurants and bars, I would recomment 983 Café, Forest Park, Sea Wolf, Momo Sushi Shack, Roberta's etc. Silvia and Ty will give you a very useful recap of the bars/cafes/restaurants nearby the basement, vith (Hidden by Airbnb) maps so you can see where they are located. Very very useful thank you! You are near the L line (Jefferson Street) and the M line (Central Av) so you have several options to reach Manhattant.

The neighborhood is great, close to the subway (about a 10m walk). Lots of shops \u0026 restaurants nearby. We met up with family during our stay and ended up walking back from the subway at 1 or 2 in the morning a couple times with no problems. It's a big city so you need to pay attention, but overall it's a GREAT neighborhood. We also drove there (on a road trip so couldn't skip having a car) and found street parking our entire stay- which was an awesome bonus.\nThe area isn't huge but is great for NYC. My husband is pretty tall (over 6') but he just watched his head and was fine. The bathroom is small (but really cute for a small space!) and the shower is great. You are in a basement, and we were there in summer so it was fairly humid inside and out, but the price, location and awesome host outweighed it. We would DEFINITELY stay here again, in a heart beat."},{"_id":"164272292","date":{"$date":"2017-06-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11708","reviewer_id":"107803499","reviewer_name":"Tiffany","comments":"Tyrome's place was exactly what we were looking for in Brooklyn.

The location was great if you're looking to check out the Bushwick/Bed-Stuy area. There's lots to do and see all around Ty's place. L train is about 3 blocks away if you're looking to head to the city. This is gonna be one of those spots where you rest your head at night after a full day of exploring not so much of a place to hang out at. Ty is a super chill guy and made everything easy.

The apartment had a changing odor from being the laundry room and the basement, meaning that it smelled part time of detergent and part time of moist. Furthermore we didn't have the opportunity to lock the basement door, which we didn't feel good about, due to all of our personal belongings being down there throughout the day. \n\nBut in general a decent apartment, where you get what you pay for. Really nice and friendly host though. Tyrome was very helpful, both in person and through text messages. The neighborhood is something of itself.

Man ist in wenigen Minuten an einer Metro Station um Downtown nach Manhatten zu kommen. In direkter Umgebung gibt es viele Möglichkeiten etwas Essen oder Trinken zu gehen außerdem findet man in der Wohnung eine Mappe mit Infos der Umgebung. \nDer Zugang zur Wohnung war anfangs etwas befremdlich, da man durch seine Galerie geht, um dann die Treppe runter in eine Kellerwohnung zu gelangen. Die Wohnung ist sauber und hat alles was man braucht. Da wir immer früh bereits die Wohnung verlassen haben und nur abends zum Schlafen zurück kamen hat es auch nicht gestört, dass kaum Tageslicht zu sehen ist. Im Zugang zum Schlafzimmer verläuft ein Rohr, dass für Leute über 1,70m zu Falle wird. Mein Freund hat sich hier mehrmals den Kopf gestoßen - also immer dran denken, Kopf einziehen ;-)\nWorauf man sich einstellen muss: man hört die Menschen in der Wohnung herumlaufen und wenn irgendwo Wasser läuft. Uns hat es nicht gestört, aber wenn man empfindlich ist, sollte man das bedenken. \nDas Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis ist ok. NY ist teuer und somit hat es den typischen Charme - aus jedem Platz wird etwas gemacht und zum Vermieten genutzt. Ich würde die Wohnung jedoch jederzeit wieder buchen. Sie war sauber und sehr gut gelegen - das wichtigste bei einer Städtereise."},{"_id":"343443890","date":{"$date":"2018-10-31T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11708","reviewer_id":"53965491","reviewer_name":"Morgan","comments":"Cozy place great for a solo trip or trip for two"},{"_id":"345281602","date":{"$date":"2018-11-04T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11708","reviewer_id":"32797389","reviewer_name":"Don","comments":"This apt is exactly what was needed after spending 12-14 hours per day in the city.

My girlfriend and I had a fantastic stay in Willy's apartment and we wish we could return.\r\n\r\nWe booked this place almost last minute as I had to move to New York to start a job and look at apartments. We're glad we went with this one. It is half a block away from the R and only a few blocks from basically every other subway line worth having in Brooklyn. We could be in Manhattan in a minute's notice. \r\n\r\nIt is only a few blocks away from Montague St, the short shopping street in the middle of Brooklyn Heights, and a little farther away from Court St, the main shopping street this side of the Gowanus Canal. In short, the location is ideal. Don't pass this place up.\r\n\r\nThe apartment itself is spacious and light. The main room/bed room has two windows on three of its four walls and is constantly filled with light. The girl who lives there is a photographer, and it is obvious that she cares about the quality of the light in the room. To top it off, the apartment is appropriately accented with a few mirrors, which brightens the space even more. The bed, with its foam and vinyl mattress, is an absolute pleasure to sleep on. \r\n\r\nThose who come to New York fearing about grime and pests need not be afraid of this apartment. It is kept immaculately clean, and we stayed there ten days without seeing even a single fly. \r\n\r\nSheets and towels are provided, as well as a mostly empty closet and lots of reading material. The internet in the apartment has its ups and downs, but is mostly and unfortunately fairly slow.\r\n\r\nAgain, you would be a fool to pass this place up, especially at this price.

While there were a couple of quirks, they weren't substantial in any way and the price was more than 50% less than nearby hotels.  The lighting in the place is stunning and the building tends to be very quiet.  Getting the keys was not a problem.  We had a bit of trouble getting in to the building a couple of times, but that was resolved with the help of a friendly neighbor who was our designated contact since the host is away.  The door to the apartment was a difficult to unlock as well, but that may have been my error.\r\n\r\nOverall, I would very highly recommend staying at Willy's place.

I call it hideaway because the apt. faces the back of the building and you hear nothing except birds chirping, no street noise. The apartment is very small: essentially the large, airy and lovely bedroom you see in the photo and then a tiny kitchen and bathroom. But it is the perfect setup and the PERFECT location if you want to be in the heart of Brooklyn Heights. There is a desk in the bedroom and an Internet connection (not perfect, but mostly worked) so I was able to get some work done too.  Willy was delightful to interact with - accommodating and prompt. After exchanging mobile numbers, we were able to text back and forth, which is very efficient. The bathroom sink turned out to be completely clogged but Willy got a plumber to fix it the next day. She met the plumber there and dealt with the situation, so it was no trouble at all for us.

The location is outstanding, and the neighborhood is ideal.  My one caveat is it felt VERY much like we were staying in someone's home to the point where there was literally zero space in the closets or bathroom cabinets for any of our stuff, as all of her belongings were there. I might suggest her putting in some kind of guests only storage if possible. The other caveat is the necessity to keep a very low profile while staying there (dont talk with the neighbors) which suggests that her renting her space may be somewhat undercover.  However, the place was clean, light and airy and very restful for sleeping. So on balance, storage aside, a very nice place to stay from convenience to beautiful views from the promenade.

The apartment, though a bit smaller then the pictures indicate, was clean, comfortable and in a great location.  The neighborhood was quintessentially Brooklyn - a quiet tree-lined street with churches and brownstones.  We felt absolutely safe at all times and noise was never an issue, even as a neighborhood festival was in full swing out front.  The apartment is an easy walk from the 2, 3 and R lines, with one-stop trips into Manhattan.  The neighborhood itself, though, had plenty to offer: two short blocks to shops, restaurants, bakeries and cafes - and the promenade with amazing views of the skyline.  Willy was outstanding with communication and helpful in getting us acclimated to the neighborhood with restaurant recommendations.  Highly recommend a stay in her wonderful apartment."},{"_id":"14398022","date":{"$date":"2014-06-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"117425","reviewer_id":"7747469","reviewer_name":"James","comments":"Our host LuLu was very helpful and responded quickly to our messages.

We arrived late on a very hot summer's day and somehow the electric plug for the air conditioning unit was missing! Luckily there was a supermarket around the corner so we had to go and buy a new extension lead in order to be able to sleep. We also had to buy toilet paper and soap as there was hardly any in the flat (for the price I was expecting everything to be included). Lulu provided new supplies to her cleaner later in the week. The bathroom works well and Lulu has great pictures around the place and nice old furniture. We had a great stay beside the rocky start. Leafy streets, very close to the water, nice neighborhood.

With no super in sight, and the heat out, and I had no choice but to find a new rental late that night.

El apartamento es pequeño, bien para una pareja. Decoración coqueta pero el equipamiento está bastante viejo: sábanas, edredón, almohadas y puerta de entrada que casi no cierra. La comunicación con la anfitriona no ha sido todo lo fluida que debería. Me quiso cambiar la reserva varias veces y luego tardaba más de 15 días en responder o directamente no respondía. Creo que debería ser más seria, a veces da la sensación que se desentiende por completo. Además  si te molestan los ruidos, ten en cuenta que el edificio es muy viejo y se oye todo. Los vecinos de arriba nos tuvieron sin dormir por sus continuas fiestas más de una noche pero por lo demás, es un alojamiento correcto teniendo en cuenta que se trata de Nueva York. "}]}

From my initial reservation until checkout everything was absolutely flawless. I contacted her and was responded to quickly, which allowed me to quickly plan my visit.  The lines of communication were open and allowed us to coordinate with one another before and during my visit.  We communicated via the AirB\u0026B App and via text message.\n\nDella was exceptionally accommodating to me, and provided me with information on great places to socialize and transportation from her home to the airport following checkout. Della also allowed me to checkout later than the prescribed time to accommodate my activities during my trip.\n\n\nThe home was clean and very comfortable and conveniently located in a neighborhood where everything is within walking distance.  Her home is settled behind a bus stop and about two blocks from the nearest subway station.  I came to play Mas for Labor Day, which occurs on Eastern Parkway and because Della literally lives around the block from the parkway, her home was the perfect choice for me. \n\n\nIn addition to Della being a super host, she is also a pretty dope individual.  She is unique and has a jovial personality which makes her an ideal host for AirB\u0026B.  I will definitely request her again and lodge with her again.

( i'm 50 years old man!)\n\nAll very petty I know but I had only just arrived and this the only contact I had with Dellasie for the whole visit, 3 days in  I actually checked out the reviews for her place again to see if I had missed something! no breakfast was offerd to me not even a cup of coffee she did't even say goodbye when I left sadly.\n\nAnyway, it doesn't give me any pleasure having to write a native review but I feel I most be honest for other people thinking of staying Dellasie.\n\nOn the plues side NY is Amazing!!"},{"_id":"218903601","date":{"$date":"2017-12-15T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11753116","reviewer_id":"7971304","reviewer_name":"Abu","comments":"Great hosts, great location.

The room was spacious , clean, and peaceful. The bed was comfortable and she went above and beyond to ensure that the room was filled with adequate storage and extras( sheets, towels , blankets, snacks, cups and bowls) without the room feeling cluttered. The blackout curtains do a great job at creating a mutually private space, while aiding to the calm atmosphere she has created . \nUpon arrival she gave a tour and thoroughly explained the nuances of her place, in the room she left detailed instructions on how to make my stay comfortable for all involved. As a host she is very gracious , highly communicative and detail oriented, I had a great time interacting with her a few times during my stay and I will definitely book this room again on my next trip to Brooklyn !"},{"_id":"282195617","date":{"$date":"2018-06-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11753116","reviewer_id":"189850851","reviewer_name":"Christian","comments":"Dieses Apartment kann ich jedem empfehlen der new york von seiner wahren Seite kennen lernen möchte.

Culture Beyond the glass and steel of Hong Kong’s commercial persona, the city also boasts a vibrant cultural scene that features the eclectic influences of its Chinese roots, colonial connections and a wondrous pool of homegrown talent. Here, you’re just as likely to find yourself applauding at Asia’s top film festival as joining in dawn taichi or reading the couplets of a local poet to the drumbeat of a dragon boat. Culture could also mean indie music under the stars, a classy art walk, your first Cantonese opera – not to mention the exhibitions and events staged year-round at the many museums and concert halls. Why I Love Hong Kong I love Hong Kong because it has a complexity that eludes definition, sometimes even by its own people. I can be soul-searching near the Chinese border, lunching with Sikhs at a Sikh temple, splurging on a set of kitchen kniv","notes":"Please note that not every neighbor is happy about the New Sharing Economy. If we want them to understand the 21st century :-) we should respect normal house rules like:  -no party after 10pm -be quiet in the staircase/hallway -don't ring at neighbours bell because you cannot find the key in your handbag -don't throw things out of the window Although the apartment is on a very high standard and equipped like a serviced apartment - I am still a private host but not a Hotel with fully employed staff and a front desk.

A thunderstorm got us stuck at the airport for an extra day, and Nico\u0026 Hester were very responsive online. Upon arrival we were disoriented because the picture of the entrance of the building was outdated - the instructions guide referred to an hairdresser that does not exist, which was replaced by some other business. How could the host miss this major turn around if they live there? The studio is super super small, perhaps this is the HK standard. The studio was clean, but the stairs going up up were dusty old, dirty, dark and narrow. The street stinks like garbage, because there are lots of restaurants. The kitchinette was equipded with the bare minimum: no sharp knife, no bowls, no cutting board; only one cup of water, 2 small mugs, 4 plates and some spoons, forks and blunt knifes. The water boiler was burned, fortunately we had a microwave and a rice cooker machine. No closet or wall hangers to hang clothes or jackets. The entrance of the studio is on a narrow hallway that is pilled up with stuff under plastic bags. Next time I´ll try to look for a residential area in HK, rather than commercial to avoid the stink. Or I´ll stay in Macau where one can find cheap 5-star hotels with big luxurious rooms, and take the fast ferry to visit HK. Comparatively, it seems that HK offers low value for your money, unless I didn´t look hard enough."},{"_id":"91929107","date":{"$date":"2016-08-07T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11778475","reviewer_id":"47040614","reviewer_name":"Celine","comments":"The best thing about this place is its location. Although the building entrance and stairs looked sketchy, we found that the place was actually safe and most importantly very convenient for going around. It also had a lot of stores/stalls surrounding the place where you can buy snacks and shop for unbranded clothes at a cheap price.\n\nThe room itself, although not big, was good enough for us (2 girls). We didn't exactly pack light, but all our things fit fine in the place. It was also very very clean and well-maintained with comfy sheets and pillows - making up for the rather average bed. \n\nEverything worked fine as well - the AC was really good/cold, heater and refrigerator worked fine, and the internet connection was good. It would have been more convenient though if more trash bins were provided. \n\nNicolas was nice and took care of everything during our stay, from check in to check out and a couple of inquiries/requests. Hester, although responsive wasn't very helpful, so Nicolas is the go-to. \n\nTl, dr: For its price (in comparison to hotels) and accessible location, this place is perfectly fine and comfortable enough.

I wished there were more comments on the stairs so I could have been more prepared for it. We had 4 suitcases since we were traveling to other places as well, so this was a bit tough for us to lug everything upstairs. The place was definitely small so our 4 suitcases didn’t give us much room to walk around. The pictures were exactly how the place looked. The white bedsheets did have some stains which was a little gross but we managed to get through it. Downstairs has a tattoo shop as well. \n\nThe location was hands down the best part. I think it definitely makes up for the cons that I have mentioned. There are food shops everywhere. You can find a breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert places all on that same block. This area is definitely a busy area so during rush hour is hard to get around by taxi. MTR is only about 5 min walk so it is very convenient. \n\nOverall, I will definitely recommend this place.

Booking and dealing with the contract was very easy and check in was a breeze with us picking our own access code in advance as we arrived late in the evening.  We had a message from PMI checking in with us the first day to ensure everything was okay and we were all settled in.   I sent one message while I was there and got a very quick response.\n\nThe condo is VERY spacious and nicely decorated.  We really loved this unit because it felt very private.  It is located away from the main entrance and we very rarely saw or heard other people in the units – even when we were sitting out on the patio. This unit is on the ground floor and I was initially worried about noise from above, but we never heard a peep the entire week.  The patio was very peaceful.\n\nThe beds were very comfortable, the linens were high quality, and the furnishings were very nice.  There were extra pillows and blankets available. Having the air conditioning was definitely a plus as some of our days were very hot and humid.  It made sleeping very comfortable!  Ceiling fans also helped a lot.\n\nThere are some good basics in the condo to get you started (hotel sized shampoo, conditioner, soap – hair dryer – laundry detergent).  Having some basics in the pantry and fridge was very helpful (seasonings, foil, plastic wrap, paper towel, etc.).\n\nYou really don’t want for anything in this unit. I would highly recommend it to anyone and wouldn't hesitate to book it again."},{"_id":"303627833","date":{"$date":"2018-08-07T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11817249","reviewer_id":"45146729","reviewer_name":"Milena","comments":"x"},{"_id":"331841980","date":{"$date":"2018-10-03T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11817249","reviewer_id":"179059591","reviewer_name":"Kendra","comments":"Great condo, excellent communication!"},{"_id":"336870886","date":{"$date":"2018-10-14T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11817249","reviewer_id":"25592444","reviewer_name":"Nicolle","comments":"This condo was very comfortable and clean!!

The room did look like from the pictures- the beds came in single twin beds, and even the comforter sets, the bedsheets were exactly like in the picture too! (even the curtains). \r\n\r\nI've to commend the room's cleanliness. One of the first few things that I noticed about the room when I stepped in was its clean floor- spick and span, I did not spot clumps of hair or the floor being covered in dust- that was one of the strengths of the room. \r\n\r\nSecondly, the toilet's floor was clean and there was no hair lying about the floor, or murky stains spotted about the toilet (not that I dared inspect every corner dilligently- but I stepped into the toilet barefooted, assured that it was clean)\r\n\r\nThey only provide basic body foam and shampoo, which are put into wall dispensers. I found the body soap to suffice but the shampoo was abit drying and so you might want to bring your own shampoo perhaps. \r\n\r\nCleanliness-wise, I give the sleeping area room + the toilets a 3.5 / 5 stars as I did not spot any dirt that irked me, the floors were clean enough to walk barefoot and they looked without dust. \r\nPerhaps, the only area which I did not walk barefoot much on was the doorway area as we were wearing shoes in and walking on it, during our first day. \r\n\r\nSpace-wise, it may be small, but mangeable for 2 people. I would say that it is just nice- roomy for 1 pax but just nice- slightly tight (depending on how spacey a room you are used to) for 2 people. Hong Kong is known for small room sizes though, so I thought this small room space is common.\r\nThe toilet is quite small though, and the places to hang your clothes/towels might not be as luxurious as hotels but we managed alright ultimately. There's not much space to move in the toilet. But its cleanliness and the reasonable price topped the space constraints! Bedroom wise , space is alright for 2 people.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, the room window was the only difficult thing managing as it was abit hard closing it and some slight dust.\r\n\r\nTowels and linen smelt fresh! Bedsheets felt clean!\r\nYou need to request for towels. \r\nHost was very obliging, VERY, in answering all my many questions!

Innerhalb von ca. 5 Minuten ist ein Mitarbeiter gekommen und ich konnte einchecken. Beim Einchecken wurde nach einer Kaution von 20€ gefragt. Das hatte ich in der Beschreibung nicht gelesen und sollte berücksichtigt werden. Da ich vor 9:30 wieder abreiste brauchte ich die Kaution nicht hinterlegen, da erst ab dieser Uhrzeit ein Mitarbeiter vor Ort gewesen wäre. Bei offenem Fenster schlafen ist aufgrund der Straßengeräuche nicht möglich dank Klimaanlage aber auch kein Problem. Für die Lage ist der Geräuschpegel auch ziemlich erträglich.

Der check- In und check-out waren problemlos, und auch eine Verlängerung des Aufenthalts war super unkompliziert. Die Gastgeber sind sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend. Die Lage war meines Erachtens perfekt. Mong Kok ist der etwas chinesischere Teil Hong Kongs, man kann Street food entdecken, shoppen gehen, und es gibt vielerlei Restaurants. Jedes Wochenende kommen die Hong Konter auf die Straße und singen, es gibt auf jeden Fall viel zu entdecken!  Die Metro war sehr nah, und man ist in windeseile in Central oder TST.  Besonders entzückend ist, dass ums Eck ein Fruchtstand ist, wo wir jeden morgen frische Fruchtshakes getrunken haben.

It is right down the street from a huge shopping and cafe district with tons of nightlife, but the studio is located just far enough not to pick up any of the noise or chaos.  Our first day (a Sunday) the was a lovely neighborhood market with tons of produce. There is a bakery and grocery store right across the street.  Ilknur was a wonderful hostess! She left us kitchen essentials, even helped us find a scale so we could weigh our baggage for the flight, and was extremely friendly and willing to help us out with anything we needed!  The previous person mentioned problems with the Internet and fridge, but these were resolved by the time we arrived. This is one of the best deals in Istanbul!

First, the location - this building is located in a non-touristy neighborhood but is only about a three minute walk to Istiklal Cad, a great pedestrian shopping district with all sorts of restaurants (both delicious Turkish food and more international options).  The walk to Istiklal is a bit steep, but it is so convenient to the apartment.  I was travelling alone and felt safe in this neighborhood (though I didn't go out late at night).  From Istiklal, you can easily take the Tunel and then the tramvay to get to the big tourist sites in Sultanahmet.  \r\nWhen I arrived, Ilknur upgraded me to another room on the first floor, so I cannot comment on studyo 7 specifically.  However, all the rooms look pretty similar - the building has been recently renovated, so all of the furniture, kitchen, bathroom, etc. is brand new, and everything was extremely clean.  The room was exactly what I wanted when on a trip - small (a studio apartment with combined bed, sitting, and kitchen area), affordable, and everything worked and was clean and comfortable.  The bathroom worked well, and the shower was substantially larger than what you normally find in a Turkish hotel!  The kitchen was stocked with basic cookware and dishes.  On Sunday there was a huge street market around the corner from the apartment, where you can buy delicious produce for very inexpensive prices.  The wireless internet worked well.  There is no air conditioning in the apartment, but Ilknur provided a fan for me when I asked for it, and I was very comfortable with the fan.\r\nIlknur was very nice and gave good advice about the area.  She really wants her guests to be comfortable and takes their suggestions into account.  I really enjoyed my stay in this apartment and would definitely recommend it to anyone I know travelling to Istanbul!"},{"_id":"5987266","date":{"$date":"2013-07-25T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1182475","reviewer_id":"15153421","reviewer_name":"Maxime","comments":"(transaltion in english below)\r\n\r\nBonjour,\r\n\r\nJ'ai loué le studio pour 4 jours avec ma copine.

There was a bottle of water and snack for me when I arrived which is very thoughtful since you don't drink the tab water in Turkey. The streets getting to the apartment from Taksim square are uneven and difficult to roll a suitcase down. If you take the bus from the airport to Taksim, I would then recommend taking a taxi to the apartment.

For American travelers one thing to keep in mind is if you do not have an international phone it will be impossible to contact the host once arrived at the airport or at the building to open the door.

Комната была грязная: повсюду пыль и грязь, которую, кажется, не убрали еще с прошлых хозяев. \nКомната находится в подвале. Возле двери две стиральные машинки, которые включают и ночью. Звук от них очень мешает спать. \nХозяина ни разу не видели. Нас встретила работница дома, которая совсем не говорит по-английский и пришлось объясняться жестами.\nНа кровати не было простыни только наматрасник. Написала об этом хозяину, чтобы принес, но он ответил лишь на последний день моего пребывания. Спала на одеяле и укрывалась своей кофтой. \nОчень темная комната. Утром темно, как ночью, но это не существенный минус.\n\nПлюсы:\nЕсть все для готовки: кастрюли, сковородка, тарелки, чашки и главное, электрическая плита. В двух шагах есть супермаркеты, где можно дешево закупиться, а напротив простое кафе, где готовят вкусные завтраки.\nЦена. За такую комнату и расположение - это лучшая цена для бюджетного туриста.\nДо всех достопримечательностей можно доехать максимум с двумя пересадками, иногда можно и дойти.

Die Gegend ist toll. Restaurants, Bars und Shops - alles in der Nähe. Brendan hat uns einen Late-Arrival sowie Late-Checkout möglich gemacht, so dass wir sehr viel von unserem Aufenthalt hatten. Die Wohnung ist aufgrund der 2 Schlafzimmer sehr gut für 4 Personen geeignet. Brendan hat immer sofort auf Anfragen reagiert und auch unser in der Wohnung vergessenes Handy an zentraler Stelle hinterlegt, so dass wir es wieder abholen konnten. Es war sehr warm in NYC, aber die Klimaanlage hat sehr gut funktioniert. Die zentrale Lage bedingt allerdings auch, dass das Schlafzimmer zur Straße nicht ganz ruhig ist. Aber dafür ist man schließlich auch in Manhattan."},{"_id":"46263519","date":{"$date":"2015-09-09T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1185644","reviewer_id":"30436576","reviewer_name":"Arin","comments":"Brendan was an amazing host and had the whole apartment set up before we arrived.

Very cosy apartment, we spent very little time here as we were out and about.

The photos give a very accurate representation of the apartment. It is up 3 flights of narrow stairs in sort of dirty hallways but it wasn't a problem at all. The apartment is upstairs above a restaurant that looked nice and did a brisk business although we didn't end up eating there. The neighborhood was great - it is a residential street with cute boutiques and eateries. We walked to STOMP (had great Risotto dinner beforehand) and to 911 Memorials and to the Brooklyn Bridge and NYU - all within 1/2 hour walk. Little Italy and Chinatown are within a few blocks. Whole Foods is 3 blocks away and Dean \u0026 Deluca the opposite direction and a CVS is a block away so food and incidentals are easily taken care of. There was construction next door so that noise was present from about 8 a.m. onward but not a problem for us. Several metro lines are available within about 3-5 blocks - getting home after seeing Broadway shows was easy. Yelp gives 4.5 stars to many of the local eateries so lots of choice. We had a car and had reserved a spot at a garage on-line beforehand. Access was very easy from coming in via Holland Tunnel. \n\nWe stayed in the winter and the apartment has steam heating (which seems typical for the area) so apartment was quite warm - we had to ditch our sweaters when in the apartment. The place is very narrow and the bathroom was tiny. We were a family of 4 with 2 big teen boys and apartment worked fine for us but we didn't try to eat anything other than breakfast or snacks in the apartment - there are only 2 stools in the kitchen. We wanted to use our AppleTV but the TV is an older model without HDMI. It is large and there is cable. We appreciated that there was a closet with plenty of hangers in each bedroom as well as plenty of drawer space so we could stash our clothes away and not have to live out of a suitcase. The kitchen was well stocked with miscellaneous spices, coffee, tea and such. \n\nBrendan was very responsive to communications and happy to accommodate us with storing our bags when we arrived early before the apartment had been cleaned. We didn't need any help during out stay but definitely felt that Brendan would have been there to help us out if we needed recommendations etc. Overall we would highly recommend this apartment."},{"_id":"125991174","date":{"$date":"2017-01-08T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1185644","reviewer_id":"2017985","reviewer_name":"Kyle","comments":"Great place, even better location.

We didn't took any taxi because we didn't need it. \nThe weather was really cold at those days at NY but  Brendan's apartment has a very good heating. The street is quite by night. We slept very well. At the date we were there, was a construction at the corner but they started to work around 8am, at that time we were already awake to see the city. Beds are really comfortable and bedrooms are not connected, are in the oposite side of the apartment, good point. Kitchen is practical and sitting room has a big size TV, and the sofa is comfortable, from my point of view, a bit small for 4 adults.\nBuilding has no elevator. For us it wasn't a problem. The stairs of the portal and the common areas need a bit cleaning. \nTo resume, Brendan is fully trustworthy. The most important point to me.

Die Aufteilung, mit den beiden Schlafzimmern auf der jeweils entgegen gelegenen Seite des Wohn-/Gemeinschaftsraums war für unser Gruppe perfekt. Genügend Privatsphäre.\nDas Bad war gut ausgestattet.\nDie Küche hatte alles was man braucht (keine Spülmaschine). Bisschen mehr Besteck wäre gut gewesen hat aber vollkommen gereicht.\nAls Unterkunft, für uns als verwöhnte Deutsche, sehr zufriedenstellend.\n\nDer größte Pluspunkt allerdings war die Lage. Ein kleiner Lebensmittelladen die Straße runter (aber nicht günstig – an der 33rd Straße ist ein Target wo man alles nötige bekommt) und die U-Bahn Stationen Spring Street, Lafayette oder Bowery Station.\nSpring und Bowery waren unsere ansicht nach die wichtigsten. Von Spring Street aus mit der Linie 6 entweder nach Norden zur 33rd Street (nahe Empire State Building), 42nd (Grend Central), 59th (Stück östlich vom Central Park) oder mit der Linie 4 nach Süden Fulton Street raus und man ist nahe World Trade Center.\nBowery perfekt für die An- und Abreise. Die Linie J und Z verbinden diese mit der Airtrain (Linie Rot) mit dem Flughafen JFK (Fahrzeit insgesamt rund 1:30 Stunde). Ihr braucht eine Metro Card (7 Tage 33 USD und ein Ticket für die Airtrain 5 USD) die ihr dort am Automaten lösen könnt. Eine Karte kann für beides genutzt werden.\n\nAls Alternative zum Hotel definitiv empfehlenswert. Als Gastgeber, war Brandan ebenfalls sehr zuvorkommend.\n\n-----\n\nBriefly to the travel group - one woman, two men\nThe apartment was great. The layout, with the two bedrooms on the opposite side of the living room/common room, was perfect for our group. Enough privacy.\nThe bathroom was well equipped.\nThe kitchen had everything you need (no dishwasher). A little more cutlery would have been good but was quite all right.\nAs accommodation, for us as spoiled Germans, very satisfactory.\n\nThe biggest advantage, however, was the location. A small grocery store down the street (but not cheap - at 33rd Street is a Target where you can get everything you need) and the subway stations Spring Street, Lafayette or Bowery Station.\nSpring and Bowery were the most important ones from our point of view. From Spring Street, take Line 6 either north to 33rd Street (near Empire State Building), 42nd (Grend Central), 59th (east of Central Park) or Line 4 south to Fulton Street and you are close to World Trade Center.\nBowery perfect for arrival and departure. The J and Z lines connect them with the Airtrain (line red) and the JFK airport (travel time about 1:30 hours). You need a Metro Card (7 days 33 USD and a ticket for the Airtrain 5 USD) which you can buy there at the vending machine. A card can be used for both.\n\nDefinitely recommended as an alternative to the hotel. As a host, Brandan was also very thoughtful.\n\nTranslated with (Website hidden by Airbnb)"},{"_id":"230899742","date":{"$date":"2018-01-29T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1185644","reviewer_id":"42782066","reviewer_name":"Marija","comments":"I was here with my boyfriend, my sister and her husband.

The apartment looks exactly as portrayed in the pictures. Its key strength is its location right in the middle of Nolita which is close to Soho, The Village, Little Italy and we even walked uptown!\nYou need to take into account that the apartment is on the 4th floor with no elevator. Also, we came to eat out so had no problem (Try the Italian which is right in the same building! by the entrance), if more than two want to eat  in the apartment - it could become a challenge as there is no space for that. As I said, when you visit NYC and you have a café two steps away and lots of restaurants all around, that should not be the issue. \nBrendan is an excellent communicator in the sense that he reacts immediately to anything you asked (before and during our stay) and doesn't nag at all!\nThanks for a great time in NYC!"},{"_id":"256802633","date":{"$date":"2018-04-23T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1185644","reviewer_id":"51966673","reviewer_name":"Christopher","comments":"Excellent location.

The apartment is as advertised--very sweet with two small balconies, a full service kitchen (including spices), and an air-conditioner, as some of the stand-outs (and the latter was very helpful in July). The thing is that you won't want to spend that much time there because the neighborhood is amazing--which was also accurately advertised. We walked or took the metro everywhere and never used our car (we lucked out and found a parking spot right after the street had been cleaned and all the other cars had to move). There are so many great restaurants, cafes and boutiques nearby, and also a sweet park right at the top of the street. We walked to Mont Royal (and then walked to the top for an amazing view), and walked to the Metro stop to get to downtown (for free concerts at the Jazz Festival), the old port, and the Jean Talon market. Also, Libby was very helpful and available via email (and if my phone worked, I assume text as well); has lots of maps and brochures in the apartment for you to look at and use; and her housecleaner, who met us and gave us the keys, was lovely and full of tips about the city.

This unit is right across the street from the market and many restaurant options are also within walking distance. You can literally watch the sunrise from your lanai here, so that can't be beat! It was nice to watch the waves  any time of day but you wouldn't want to swim at this beach.\nThe bed was really soft when we first sat on it but surprisingly comfortable, the pillows were lovely. There are a few beach things available that were a nice touch (possibly left by other travelers) - chairs, a football, some snorkel gear.\nA few negatives - it is written in the welcome binder that you can't turn the A/C below 70 or the fridge below the midpoint or they will stop working. That was a bit frustrating. There was an odd smell in the bathroom - it may have just been that the shower curtain needed to be replaced.\nWe didn't end up cooking here at all as we had planned to, there were no basics like oil or salt \u0026 pepper provided and we didn't want to buy them for just a few days' stay. Plus with just the one tiny sink it seemed like a big hassle.

Das Abholen des Parkausweises an der Rezeption und das Erhalten des Schlüssels über den Schlüssel Safe war problemlos und ging einfach. Auch war unsere Wohnung schon über 2 Stunden früher fertig als ursprünglich geplant und wir können unser Zimmer früher beziehen. Die Anlage an sich mit Pool ist sehr ruhig und schön. Das Einkaufszentrum direkt gegenüber hat viele gute Möglichkeiten einkaufen zu gehen, ohne ein Auto benutzen zu müssen.\nWie beschrieben lag die Einheit im Erdgeschoss mit direktem Blick zum Meer. Wir haben das sehr genossen, weil man einfach die Balkontür aufmachen und direkt mit wenigen Schritten bis zum Strand gehen konnte. Schwimmen war hier super. Während die meisten Strände auf Hawaii aufgrund der Riffe fürs Schwimmen eher schwierig sind, konnten wir vor dem Restaurant circa 30 m rechts von unserem Hotel völlig frei von Riff und Steinen super gut im Wasser schwimmen. Über das Hotel gibt es kostenfrei Sonnenliegen, die man sich überall hin schieben kann wo man möchte. Dass wir in unserer Wohnung zusätzlich noch zwei kleine Strandstühle zur Verfügung hatten fanden wir super. Auch Handtücher für Bad und Strand waren mehr als ausreichend verfügbar. Für Unternehmungen auf Kauai liegt Kapaa besonders gut. Sowohl in den Norden als auch in den Süden sind alle Sehenswürdigkeiten in Kürze erreichbar.

We were specifically looking for a quiet place not far from the center.  And we realized that it was quite difficult to find such place in Barcelona.  But Patricia's apartment was exactly what we were looking for.  It's located in Gracia disctrict which is 5 minutes walk from Passage de Gracia (one of the main streets of Barcelona which brings you to the Cataloniya square).  But at the same time it's a district where local people leave and it has a charm old Barcelona - historical buildings, nice cosy squares full of life, plenty of food shops and even market with fresh sea food, vegetables and Spanish specialities.  This is exactly the place where you can feel the real, not turistic Barcelona.  We felt very comfortable and safe there.  The apartment is simple but has everything you need - 2 big comfortable bads, kitchen with oven, microwave and all the necessary utensils.  There is also washing machine but we did not use it.  In one of sleeping rooms there is a small cosy balcony where you can enjoy your glass of wine or breakfest.  Due to the fact that both sleeping-rooms windows looks to the patio, it's absolutely quiet at night.  And you can only hear a sound of old clock which goes from the clocktower on the neighboring square which is the main square of Gracia district.  That gives you a wonderfull feeling of being in another century.  So, we got all we have expected and even more:).  And Patricia was also great as host.  We had only one problem with wi-fi in the first day which she fixed immediately that day.  It was very easy and comfortable for us to communicate with Patricia.  So, we would recommend her appartment to those who want to enjoy real Barcelona in a comfortable and quiet way:).

Around 2am on the second night we couldn't take it and made an \"instant booking\" with Patricia. She was out of the city, and didn't see my message until early morning. Still, Patricia was able to contact me and arrange for us to check in early. She made sure we knew all the necessary information and made it clear I could contact her at anytime if I needed to.\r\n\r\nThe apartment itself is somewhat nicer than the pictures show. The terrace off the large bedroom is great for relaxing and having breakfast, the front is nice to look into the street and feel the vibe. There were towels for each of us and soap in the bathroom and kitchen. It is very bright, the air conditioning works great, and the bathroom and kitchen are all in excellent order. We found the beds to be very comfortable as well. The location is really nice. We rented bikes and used them all the time, so I can't really comment on the public transportation access. There is an elevator which is really small, but very handy for luggage hauling. \r\n\r\nAll in all just a fantastic experience.

The bathroom is not as \"new\" as said in some comments...\r\n- the kitchen was poorly equipped for 4 people\r\n- the bed in which our 2 eldest children slept was a good size for 2 but the blanket and the pillows were from another age. The pillows were so much old and dirty, they were almost brown, which is unacceptable when you know the price of a pillow at Ik*a.  The blanket and the sheets were for a single bed.\r\nWe found a sheet that had not been washed, hopefully, we asked for cleaned sheet and Patricia left it in the apartment while we were out. \r\n- hopefully, our bed was comfortable. But before coming in her apartment, I had asked Patricia if there were black curtains to the windows and she had answered yes, which was right, but only in one of the 2 bedrooms and in the leaving room.\r\n\r\nConclusion: very good situation but the flat really needs to be refurbished.

I think the only thing we had to buy other than food was some more toilet paper.   Patricia responds to emails promptly and was very friendly.  The highest complement I can give is that I will definitely stay here next time I am in Barcelona.   There is a really popular and excellent sushi restaurant right next door and a great square half a block away with coffee shops and restaurants.  We made our own coffee every morning but went to the bakery right across the street for fresh Pa (bread) and Croissants.\r\n\r\nI cannot say enough good things about Gracia.  If you want to hang out with tourists and junk shops, stay near the Ramblas or in the Barri Gotic.    If you want to stay with the locals, in a central location, Gracia is the neighborhood.  At the local market, which is 3 blocks away, we were consistently the only tourists there as opposed to the famous La Boqueria which is crawling with them and does not have the neighborhood vibe.  Same for the restaurants and bars in Gracia:  mostly locals and all excellent.  Buses aren't right outside your door, but an easy walk to Diagonal from where you can go anywhere.  Between the Citymapper app and (Hidden by Airbnb) maps the extensive bus system is easy to use.\r\n\r\nIf you just want to hit museums and sights and want to be able to get a taxi or metro right out your front door, there are probably better places to stay.  But I am telling you, you will miss what Barcelona is really about.\r\n\r\n"},{"_id":"27466972","date":{"$date":"2015-03-05T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1188839","reviewer_id":"16653769","reviewer_name":"Siri","comments":"Nice apartment with a perfect location!

Firstly the apartment looks better in the photos than it actually is. Secondly we had problems with various aspects of the apartment ; the TV ( replaced after a week which was fine ) , the oven ( never fixed despite repeated requests ) and the bathroom ( a horrible smell acknowledged by the owners but once again nothing done to rectify the issue. However the most frustrating part was the lack of response to our texts or emails from the owners. In the end we gave up expecting a reply from them. A very poor effort in light of the fact this is the minimum you would expect and also surprising in light of previous reviews. Finally and perhaps not surprising the driver the owner organised to take us to the airport never turned up.  The only positive was the area which was lovely ; great bars, restaurants , shops and squares all very close by. \n\n"},{"_id":"32033798","date":{"$date":"2015-05-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1188839","reviewer_id":"15863859","reviewer_name":"Pilar","comments":"It was a great stay at Patricia's apartment!

The apartment is clean, compact, and cozy. The bed is comfortable. The apartment opens at the front (LR) to the street, and at the back (BDRs) to a shared courtyard area (with other buildings). There were a couple of minor things which needed repairs (burnt-out light bulbs, e.g.) and replenishment (detergent, coffee), but I assume those things have been taken care of by now. I noticed that another reviewer had remarked on a bad smell from the bathroom. Seems to be a municipal issue; I advise keeping ALL drains firmly plugged when not using. Now, the location: fantastic (if \"lively\": even ordinary conversation levels ricochet off the building walls). Great proximity to everything (transit, sites), very walkable (shops), amenities galore.

He was very friendly and it was a good chat. The place itself was spacious for the money, charming, comfortable and VERY close to an old-town plaza in Garcia -- as well as all the shopping on the main streets. Also, Gaudi's La Pedrera is walking distance away. Traveling alone, it was more space than I needed, but a far better deal than the hotels! Also, the wi-fi was smokin' fast, so I was able to take care of some business on my iPhone using that.

Few downsides include very small lift (of course, appreciate the fact there is one!), however it's just for one person. If like me you have 2 small kids and a bag on a shoulder you won't be able to fit inside. Also it's way too small for buggy. There is no window in the bath which is very bad for overall ventilation of the flat. There is a sewage smell outside, but that seems to be a wider problem in Barcelona. Having said all that, the flat has all the amenities needed; the host was very nice and provided us with the cot for the baby.

The private small balcony in one of the rooms was nice. The supermarket just next door was very convenient. Very nice restaurants and bakery shops within 2-minute walking distance from the house (don't miss the Las Euras Restaurant). However, there is one thing you need to be aware of if you have a car, and that's the festival time; during this period most of the alleys towards the house are closed and so, you won’t be able to drive up to the apartment’s entrance. That's what happened to us, and we weren’t informed ahead of the time that there was going to be a festival in the neighborhood. We ended up looking for a public parking for about an hour. Patricia was helpful in guiding us to a nearby parking when we called her and explained the situation, but had we known about the festival, we would have saved time and energy."},{"_id":"98610982","date":{"$date":"2016-08-31T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1188839","reviewer_id":"39184984","reviewer_name":"Matthew","comments":"This is the place to stay in Barcelona.

The apartment is in a terrific position near to a lovely square, is relatively spacious and has a well equipped kitchen. The bathroom is fine, with a powerful shower. However, the photos are deceptive, and there has been little recent maintenance. The blind in the second bedroom - not the one pictured - was ripped and the mechanism was broken, so it was not possible to raise it, making the room always dark. The window itself, which can be accessed from the balcony, has no handle or lock, a clear security hazard. There is only one bedside lamp in the main bedroom, not two as pictured, and it didn't work - neither did the one in the second bedroom. The wall lights in the living area would not work, the uplighter had no bulb, a kitchen wall light has no shade and the extractor in the bathroom does not function. The air conditioning in the living area is efficient, but there is none in either bedroom. The second bedroom has no mirror. All of which is a shame, as this is potentially an excellent place to stay in Barcelona.

The pictures offer a very accurate depiction of the unit. What I enjoyed the most; however, was the area that the Airbnb unit was. It is very close walking distance to many restaurants and cafes but far enough from the major tourist hubs to get a more local vibe to your stay. \n\nLike some of the other reviews, there seems to be quite a lot of street noise that you can hear from the unit during the night so if you are a light sleeper that may be an issue. Another thing, the bathroom ventilation isn't the best (there is none) and the bathtub really badly needed some Draino. The tub did not drain that well so when we shower, there would be at least 1-2 inches of water that would gather. Because it drains so slow, the tub would get that nasty layer of soap scum. We had to shower, turning the water on and off during our shower along with rinsing the tub after each person which was inconvenient. \n\nOverall, we really enjoyed the unit and the location. It was perfect for what we were looking for during our stay. The reason my rating for this place is mediocre is the host. \n\nPatricia seemed to be great prior to booking. She responded very quickly and answered the questions directed at her. However come closer to the day of our check-in, she wasn't responsive at all. Information such as check-in procedures or parking accommodation (she list parking on site as a feature) should be pretty standard. However come 1-2 days before my check-in when I was messaging about how to check-in she was not responsive. When you are traveling a good 24 hours to get there, worrying about figuring out how to meet your host to get into your Airbnb unit was the last thing you would want to worry about. But that isn't even the worst of it. My major complaint is that when we messaged her about one of the balcony doors not working, she responded immediately and sent someone to fix it. However, our other messages about where we can park our rental car were blatantly ignored. This just makes me think she only responds to things that's imperative to her and not her guests. And still to this day, all our messages went without responses. Pretty much the worst host experience, ever."},{"_id":"113876721","date":{"$date":"2016-11-14T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1188839","reviewer_id":"52855798","reviewer_name":"Alessia","comments":"El apartamento es muy bonito y lindo, situado en un buen barrio y sobretodo cercano a los transpotes publicos"},{"_id":"117317610","date":{"$date":"2016-12-06T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1188839","reviewer_id":"50483667","reviewer_name":"Juli","comments":"El apartamento está super bien ubicado en el corazòn del barrio de Gracia, es muy lindo el barrio y cerca de todo!

The apartment does the trick: roof over your head, beds, kitchen and bathroom. But above that it lacks charm, love for detail and is apparently run by a company as opposed to a host - like so many in Spain and Portugal. \r\nNOTE\r\nThe stair case is steep, twisted and narrow. If you are with a baby - like us - this was a bit of a hassle. If you have disabilities you should not rely on the elevator. It broke down on us. So maybe choose a differing apartment. \r\n\r\nSo in a nutshell:\r\nIt houses you but that's about it. All is clean and essential necessities are all met but really that's it.

They say location, location, location is everything and this was true with this apartment. Perfectly situated neat the Plaza de Garcia, walkable to everything from a market downstairs, to pizza, sushi, bakeries, coffee all less than a block from the apartment's main entry. The availability to find an adult beverage never lets you down in Spain and this location didn't either as there are a dozen places within a block to get a beer or wine. The nearby plaza is a block away where one can eat, drink or just relax on a bench and watch the locals enjoy the town square and bell clock tower. We walked a lot during our stay to get to know the city better. We would walk 3-5 miles away to get to popular areas like Las Ramblas, Park Guell, Camp Nou but only because we chose to. Other times we would just walk a very short distance to the end of the street to catch a cab or walk 2 blocks to get on to the public metro system which is a real value and easy to use to get anywhere in the city. The apartment comes with everything you need, air conditioning, full kitchen, clothes washer, two balconies, dining table and living room. Definitely very roomy for just one couple as we did but could comfortably fit a smaller family of 4 or 5. The bedrooms were on the quiet side of the apartment so that was an added bonus as it is common to hear the locals walking in the streets at all time of the night from their night out and expressing their happiness to all to hear but from the bedrooms, we didn't hear anything. Patricia was very accommodating and has excellent communication prior to our arrival. I wouldn't change a thing if given another opportunity to return. Thanks Patricia!

The previous apartments and hosts were great! This stay was quite the opposite!  I messaged Patricia over 10 days before check in and again two days before, and she had not responded to either messages. This was through Airbnb. I then reached out to Airbnb for help, they too could not get ahold of her. They suggested we find alternative lodging to ensure we had a place to stay in Barcelona because we couldn't confirm with Patricia. So, we spent half the day of our vacation time doing so, which was no easy task since this was now two days before check in, in Barcelona! We finally had to have our host call her for us to see if he could get her.......and he did! He confirmed everything and we checked in.\nThe apartment was in a great location, however, the state of it was not! The towels were stained and the shower curtain smelled bad which made the bathroom smell too! As a result, we ended up washing the shower curtain. The bathtub was not draining so we were taking showers in standing water. Also, the kitchen was not cleaned properly. We even saw a few roaches in the kitchen. All of this we were okay with, however, there is only one thing we had the hardest time with. In the apartment description, it states \"Air conditioning\" what it does not state is that it is only in the living area!  Even with the bedroom doors open, we had a hard time sleeping. Even if we had ceiling fans that would have helped. We paid good money for this apartment and we did not feel that it was up to par! Check in was with someone else, so we didn't even meet Patricia. She didn't even apologize for not responding to my messages. Overall, not a pleasant experience at all!"},{"_id":"158774184","date":{"$date":"2017-06-08T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1188839","reviewer_id":"56057309","reviewer_name":"Yeyao","comments":"我觉得这里很方便,而且很干净,但是整个楼是比较老的,房间一面还是有些老旧的感觉,但是地理位置确实很棒的!"},{"_id":"160256174","date":{"$date":"2017-06-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1188839","reviewer_id":"26327820","reviewer_name":"Jennifer","comments":"Patricia's apartment is in a terrific location.  .5 from several metro stations and\nWalking distance to fabulous shopping and dining on Passeig de Gracia.

We loved wandering from square to square in the neighborhood - sampling fabulous food and excellent gelato! It is walking distance to lots of shopping and dining. \n\nThere is a fabulous bakery for breakfast croissants and pastries straight out of the oven - about a block and a half away on the main street. You can visit a pretty big fresh fruit, vegetable and seafood market (Mercat de l'Abaceria) about 6 blocks away where the locals shop. There is a small grocery store two doors away from apartment and a larger one across Square. Kibuki Japanese restaurant's sushi was excellent. \n\nOne of our favorite spots for lunch was La Vietnamita. 3 blocks away - fantastic flavors. I can't stop thinking about it - even a couple weeks later. \n\nThe apartment is a third floor apartment (2nd floor for Europeans) with a small elevator if needed. There was lots of closet space. It was very nice to have a good washing machine stocked with laundry detergent and a drying rack at the end of our trip. The shower worked great. The air conditioner is in the living room and is very quiet, but it cooled the whole apartment including the bedrooms quite well. \n\nThoroughly enjoyed our stay and have already recommended this apartment to some friends who are traveling to Barcelona next week. Just print out a map before you leave - to show your taxi driver. Our taxi driver from the airport claimed (Hidden by Airbnb) Maps couldn't find it - (not true by the way).

If you're planning to explore most of touristy BCN (Barri Gotic, etc), know that it's about a 25-min walk from the apartment. We loved walking, but some may prefer a taxi or metro. The apartment itself is slightly less modern than it appeared in the pictures, and some amenities were missing on our stay (TV, some light bulbs, broken coffee pot) but we made do. The only issue we had was with some bathroom cleanliness -- a good deep clean should do the trick. Other than that, we thought this space was a great value and we'd be happy to book it again. And Patricia was very communicative and helpful before our arrival. As for the neighborhood, Gracia is terrific, and far less touristed than other neighborhoods. Lots of cute squares, a great bakery directly across from the apartment (Forn Goya), and plenty of good cafes. Check out Carrer de Verdi for lots of great restaurants at night, and the closest Gaudi house (Casa Vicens) was turned into a museum only in Nov 2017."},{"_id":"230389485","date":{"$date":"2018-01-28T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1188839","reviewer_id":"71431005","reviewer_name":"Alex","comments":"Great apartment in a very good location.

But there's a decent sized living room (with TV, if required) and a small but perfectly good kitchen, plus a little terrace off one of the bedrooms with a washing machine and line.\n\nOnly complaints - an excessive cleaning charge of £45 for a two-night/one-day stay (making a 65% surcharge when you add in the mysterious AirBnB 'service fee') and there was no lightbulb in either of the bedside lights (and we couldn't find a spare anywhere). \n\nIt would also be nice if Patricia would recommend some of the nice places to eat and drink, since local knowledge is always a bonus; she did mention one tapas restaurant (La Pepita) which was great, and recommended a good nearby wine merchant (Enterwine) when asked. We found another (Antunez) on our own, which was even better. Excellent coffee too in a cafe in the Placa (Nabucco Tiramisu).\n\nOverall, it's a lovely place to stay away from the noise, traffic, tourist crowds, high prices and pickpockets of downtown Barcelona. I would definitely go back.\n\nTC"},{"_id":"251113697","date":{"$date":"2018-04-07T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1188839","reviewer_id":"63896762","reviewer_name":"Christian Bourgaut","comments":"Thank you Patricia"},{"_id":"265455075","date":{"$date":"2018-05-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1188839","reviewer_id":"10725476","reviewer_name":"Fedja Daniel","comments":"The Apartment is absolutely fine and looks like it's on the pictures.

How vet when we stayed there, here was a terrible chemical odor coming from the bathroom - we could never figure out exactly where. It smelled like either drain cleaner or rat poison and made me nauseous. The owner was not helpful and ignored my next email saying the odor was still there.even after 2 days and much airing out. We had to sleep with all of the windows open which was fine because we had perfect weather but it would have been awful if he hadn’t been able to do that. I would not recommend because of this. I usually give glowing recommendations and am a regular Airbnb user so this is disappointing. This area is great so don’t hesitate to look for other options nearby.

A facilidade de acesso à boa gastronomia portuense é um ponto a ter em conta nesta local.","notes":"O apartamento situa-se num primeiro andar apenas acessível por escadas.","transit":"Nas imediações há linhas de eléctricos, autocarros públicos e turísticos, e até um helicóptero para quem desejar fazer um tour aéreo pela região.","access":"","interaction":"","house_rules":"","property_type":"Apartment","room_type":"Entire home/apt","bed_type":"Real Bed","minimum_nights":"3","maximum_nights":"1125","cancellation_policy":"strict_14_with_grace_period","last_scraped":{"$date":"2019-02-16T05:00:00.000Z"},"calendar_last_scraped":{"$date":"2019-02-16T05:00:00.000Z"},"first_review":{"$date":"2016-05-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"last_review":{"$date":"2018-01-05T05:00:00.000Z"},"accommodates":4,"bedrooms":1,"beds":4,"number_of_reviews":5,"bathrooms":{"$numberDecimal":"1.0"},"amenities":["TV","Wifi","Kitchen","Heating","Family/kid friendly","First aid kit","Fire extinguisher","Essentials","Shampoo","translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_50","Host greets you"],"price":{"$numberDecimal":"75.00"},"extra_people":{"$numberDecimal":"15.00"},"guests_included":{"$numberDecimal":"2"},"images":{"thumbnail_url":"","medium_url":"","picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/ffa25079-bcb3-416c-88f1-c81fc0e6a88e.jpg?aki_policy=large","xl_picture_url":""},"host":{"host_id":"63486615","host_url":"https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/63486615","host_name":"Francisco","host_location":"Porto, Porto District, Portugal","host_about":"","host_thumbnail_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/3046e63a-ebad-4527-9acb-b810da82da38.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","host_picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/3046e63a-ebad-4527-9acb-b810da82da38.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","host_neighbourhood":"","host_is_superhost":false,"host_has_profile_pic":true,"host_identity_verified":false,"host_listings_count":2,"host_total_listings_count":2,"host_verifications":["email","phone","facebook","google","reviews"]},"address":{"street":"Porto, Portugal","suburb":"","government_area":"Lordelo do Ouro e Massarelos","market":"Porto","country":"Portugal","country_code":"PT","location":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-8.63001,41.1455],"is_location_exact":true}},"availability":{"availability_30":17,"availability_60":47,"availability_90":77,"availability_365":352},"review_scores":{"review_scores_accuracy":10,"review_scores_cleanliness":10,"review_scores_checkin":10,"review_scores_communication":10,"review_scores_location":8,"review_scores_value":9,"review_scores_rating":96},"reviews":[{"_id":"76708721","date":{"$date":"2016-05-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11902059","reviewer_id":"20362882","reviewer_name":"Sabine","comments":"Die Wohnung war einwandfrei. Alles ist sehr neu und frisch renoviert. Es hat uns an nichts gefehlt!\r\nFrancisco hat uns eine super Beschreibung gemacht, wie wir vom Flughafen zu der Wohnung kommen und wir haben es auf Anhieb gefunden. Zur Begrüßung gab es ein paar Flaschen Wasser und Obst. Das war wirklich toll. Dann hat er sich sehr viel Zeit genommen und alle Fragen zu Porto beantwortet und uns Tipps für die Stadt gegeben.\r\nDie Nachbarschaft ist ruhig, es gibt ein paar kleine Cafes und Restaurants, ein Supermarkt ist auch in der Nähe. Und die Wohnung liegt gleich am Fluss, was sehr schön ist.\r\nBei der Abreise lief auch alles perfekt. Francisco war sehr flexibel was An- und Abreise betrifft.\r\nDefinitiv eine Weiterempfehlung!"},{"_id":"97109370","date":{"$date":"2016-08-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"11902059","reviewer_id":"8899599","reviewer_name":"Jan","comments":"Rustige wat verlaten straatje.

Das Haus liegt in einer engen Gasse in zweiter Reihe zur Hafenpromenade. die Wohnung liegt im ersten Stock, ist neu renoviert und sehr großzügig. Die Luft ist etwas muffig. Der Standort optimal und etwas abseits vom Touristentrubel. Das Tapas Restaurant gleich um die Ecke mit Blick auf den Douro ist absolut zu empfehlen.
