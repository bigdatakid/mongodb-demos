Roger welcomed us when we got there and gave us our keys. He also offered a quick run down of events and other activities going on around the city which was very helpful. The apartment was super close to transit which was very convenient and the cafe/diner right at the corner was delicious with great coffee. The parking was very limited and had to be paid for at a rate of $9 for 3 hours at a time but roger advised that we could download an app and top up our parking from anywhere. There were no public paid parking lots or garages nearby so plan ahead for where you will park if you bring a vehicle. I would also suggest bringing a fan or two as it was hard to get airflow through the apartment to help with the heat at night. The kitchen was well stocked with utensils, pots, and pans.

This street is absurdly stylish and romantic, with trim boutiques, striped stone footpaths and animated crowds. It's home to Porto's most ornate tearoom, the art nouveau Café Majestic, and the extraordinary azulejo-bedecked Capela das Almas. You will find most international shops, but if you venture in the small side alleys on both sides of the street, you will find many traditional shops. You might as well not even try to resist the mouth-watering pâtisseries and do not resist the bread either because Portuguese bread is an experience!

的住宿｡"},{"_id":"298887497","date":{"$date":"2018-07-30T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"26487387","reviewer_id":"192697821","reviewer_name":"玥","comments":"和朋友來看演唱會,每天都比較累,回來休息還是比較舒服的｡附近有旺角地鐵站和旺角東地鐵站,幾分鐘可以走到,旺角東稍微遠一些,公交也比較方便,樓下就有一個公交車站~"},{"_id":"303214484","date":{"$date":"2018-08-07T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"26487387","reviewer_id":"134616944","reviewer_name":"生","comments":"房间很干净

Just a quick 5 minute drive up to the main highway will get you going towards many attractions on this island. At night, fall asleep to the subtle sounds of nature, wild life and crashing waves - it was really really nice (I am a light-sleeper and I slept very well here). \nI would stay here again.

We also had the towels changed and the place cleaned half way through our stay which was unexpected but very welcomed. It felt more like a hotel than an AirBnB. \nThe flat overlooks a lovely square, there is a nice coffee shop in it and a beautiful church overlooking. Plenty of super markets nearby and a bakery 2mins away on the edge of the square. Plenty of places nearby for food or drinks. \nThe Metro is outside and only 2/3 stops to the most touristy places, we enjoyed walking instead so we could see more of the area. \nOur host met us and took time to explain everything in the flat and surrounding area which is much appreciated. \nThis is the nicest AirBnB I've stayed in yet and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it. \nIn addition Porto is a very special city, different to Lisbon (which we had got the train from).

Since we were one of the first guests of this new location run by the tpc Organisation, the price was extremely low and every item in the little house was brand new. Thy even gave us beach-towles, a volley ball a foot ball, 4 beach-ball rackets and stuff to build sand-castles... the kitchen was brand new and had every thing you need. There was a new coffe-machine, a new microwave, a oven, an induction-cooking-station and every thing else you can imagine. The guy who made the check-in with us was extremely nice and gave us many sight seeing tipps and explained us every thing we needed to know. The garden and the patio ar quite roomy so we could even play football. There is a big table in the garage to pull out for dinner outside. The bathrooms were very clean an roomy, the shower is new. There is a shop (continente) where you can buy every thing you need 850m away and a Cafe/Bar/Bistro were you can buy friesh bread and pastel de nata (must try!) just around the corner. The location is a 20min-Uberdrive away from the city-center (cost for the uber drive was around 10euro). The beach is 5min walk away and very clean and calm. The only little downside were the dogs in the neighbourhood barking the hole night... every thing else was absolutely perfect!

It is very well located – really close to the metro and bus station and to the ferry (about 5 minutes from the door) – you can easily reach all the important tourist sites in just few minutes by metro or by boat. (We highly recommend you to take a boat – it takes about 20-30 minutes to Eminonu – Sultanahmet or to Karakoy – Galata – and see the city from the Bosphorus.) In the neighbourhood of the apartment you can find everything you need – shops, restaurants, bars, cafes (local Turkish and also Starbucks) and services etc. \nWe met Eren the first day we arrived. We did not need any special help or advices, as it was not our first visit to Instanbul, but Eren was constanly within reach on the phone, willing to help or advise all the time. There is no reason not to believe him. In all cases, he responded very quickly on all our messages.\nWe should note that people with very light sleep could be disturbed by the disco which is somewhere in the quarter, which can be heard in some days in the front room. Otherwise the apartment is very quiet.\nWe appreciated the balcony – it is a great place to unwind after a long day or to take a breakfast.\nAnyway, we definitely recommend a stay at Eren’s place and we will be happy to return if we have an opportunity to do so.\n"},{"_id":"295698626","date":{"$date":"2018-07-24T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"26701226","reviewer_id":"11286381","reviewer_name":"Clea","comments":"My friends and me enjoyed the stay at Eren’s place a lot.

We arrived and were dumbstruck by the beauty of the view and the garden that frames it. It's perched above Waipio Valley, maybe one of the most beautiful places on earth, and it's situated so that you can take it all in from the garden, if the weather is nice, or from inside, if it's raining.  The weather seems to constantly shift in the valley, which only makes sense, since it is a rainforest. But that made the experience all the more interesting.  Travelers should take note that since it *is* in the middle of a rainforest, it can get pretty damp inside. Bugspray is a must if you're going to sit outside. Maybe the single best view from the house is from the tub in the screened-in bathroom—you should absolutely take a bath and watch the sunset.  The water takes a while to get warm, but it does get there.  \r\n\r\nTransportation-wise, we debated whether we needed a Jeep or not. You *don't* need a Jeep to get to the house, but to get down into the valley itself—which you absolutely must do—you must have 4WD or otherwise very sturdy walking shoes and a lot of ambition. It's a long steep walk back up.  (We opted to get the Jeep.)  \r\n\r\nThe house is more cabin-in-the-woods than it is a luxury cabana, so come in the spirit of being thrust into beautiful and rugged nature, and you won't be disappointed. It's a truly special spot.

Nestled in tall bamboo and lush green vegetation, we felt we had total privacy  -- and the only sounds were the birds, occasional rainfall, and frogs, frogs, frogs (the nocturnal kind)! It was exactly what I -- a city person --  would imagine living in the midst of the Amazon rainforest would be like (minus the snakes).  :)  Of course the magnificent view from this Waipio rim location must certainly be among the best in the area (the photo is exactly as it is).

Neighbors are virtually invisible, though there was one memorable visit from a hyper-enthusiastic, friendly, overjoyed to be petted, but utterly-silent white dog, who vanished just as she had appeared, like a ninja.  \r\n\r\nThis place is about views and sound.  An unseen rush of water cascades through the verdant chasm, the soundtrack for the 'living photograph' views of the mouth of Waipio and coastline beyond.  In rainy weather, only with some difficulty and potential danger might you catch a glimpse of this torrent, a churning chocolate upstream, and only your ears telling you that it has turned to a waterfall somewhere below you, pounding down somewhere in the distance below the swinging love-seat outside the entry.  I found myself mesmerized by view and sound, with any number of similar waterfalls visible in the distance across Waipio.\r\n\r\nWe realized soon after arriving that, unlike with most hotel accommodations, there needn't be any guilt or regrets for finding a lazy minimal-travel schedule that allows one to STAY here and enjoy the place.

The bright and cheerful cottage was a memorable perch for our two-day stay. It's an older property, somewhat rustic, but well-mainained, so adjust your expectations accordingly (and be Ok with the geckos, inside and out, and bring mosquito repellant). The bed is comfortable, the kitchen has been updated, and though the shower is small, it has good water pressure. The proximity to Waipio Valley cannot be beat. Although we had 4WD, we chose to walk down to the valley floor/black sand beach, and highly recommend that over driving, which seemed dangerous and risky for the inexperienced. We were completely taken by the grandeur of waking up this view and watching the sun wash over the 2000 ft cliffs. And equally enamored with drifting off to sleep alongside the symphony of rainforest frogs outside. I appreciate that there is no additional cleaning fee or taxes--it's all included in the $250 nightly rate. More than any other place we stayed, the Cliffhouse and Honokaa/Kukuihaele is less touristy and nestled among local residents. Parts of the neighborhood seem economically depressed and the sight of chained up dogs was heart-wrenching to us as animal lovers. But having the property owner's friendly cat and dog visit us was delightful and comforting. Our cell phones did not work at all for calls, but there IS wifi, thus emails and texts can be sent and received, if more slowly than your used to. Definitely arrive during daylight hours. Though the instructions provided were spot on, the cliff house is tucked away and the area is very dark at night.

It was such a welcome change in scenery from black lava to lush rainforest.  \n\nThe house is a charming private retreat where you can really get away from it all.  I really enjoyed the jungle come alive at night. it's actually quite loud!  Every night my husband and I established a relaxing routine after dinner: 1) draw a soothing jacuzzi bath, 2) drink wine on the porch embracing the stunning waipio valley, and 3) fall asleep by the warm glowing fireplace in peace and serenity.  Four nights like that make you never ever want to leave.  \n\nThe bonus were our daily visits from the neighbors dogs and cat. They are the absolute sweetest dogs!   One of them likes to bark a bit at first to say hi but don't be alarmed :)\n\nThere were only a couple drawbacks; mosquitoes are inevitable here and they will inevitably get inside no matter how careful you are with the door.  My husband and I are prone to be bitten so Unfortunately we were bitten a number of times; I started to get a bit paranoid about it but you basically should just cover up at all times - especially when you go to sleep. \n\nAlso this is isn't really a cooking kitchen and there no microwave with limited cooking accessories. So id recommend cooking simple meals.  There's good places to eat for dinner 25 min away in Waimea.  And there malama market in honokaa. You can get a duraflame log there (if it doesn't run out) for the fireplace.  The logs that are on the property are too wet and won't light.  \n\nEnjoy!"},{"_id":"59747462","date":{"$date":"2016-01-15T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2670173","reviewer_id":"42315205","reviewer_name":"Inga","comments":"We liked the house and especially the perfect view from the cliffs.

You can hear the waterfall, the flowers are beautiful, and the bathtub room is something that would be $100/hour minimum at a spa. We're pet people, so we were happy to see friendly animals when we arrived, but heads up for anyone with pet allergies- the cat has a sense of entitlement to the house. Also, 3 of the dogs are very sweet and friendly (although if you try to give them food they may start fighting), but one other dog, who was either stray or had recently had puppies, was snarling and posturing very aggressively, and followed us into the driveway. I'm a ranch kid, I've been around animals my whole life, and I can clearly see when a dog is potentially aggressive vs. just barking defensively... and I didn't feel comfortable approaching this dog at all. I understand that the property is on the rural side and that means a relaxed attitude toward keeping pets confined, which I'm actually used to and don't mind at all- but the presence of an aggressive dog is not appropriate for a vacation rental. If I were the type of person who was just scared and tried to run from the dog, I'm quite sure it would've chased me. It continued to snarl and move toward me even after I clapped loudly at it and yelled at it to go home. It didn't back off until I started kicking gravel from the driveway at it. I would've called the host to ask her to come deal with it, but unfortunately she was unresponsive through our 2 day stay. I left her a voicemail and called several times the day of our checkin, and I'm back on the mainland now and she still hasn't called me back. I'm new to Airbnb, this vacation was the first time we've ever used it, and I had just been checking my email for correspondence rather than opening the Airbnb app- turns out there were several messages I hadn't seen, including one from our host that contained all the details of our checkin. It was my fault for not checking the messages via the app, but on the day of our checkin we weren't quite sure what the procedure was going to be, and when I called the host, her phone went straight to voicemail every time. So... All that having been said, I'd still highly recommend this place to a friend, provided that the aggressive dog issue is dealt with. The location is absolutely breathtaking, the accommodations are very comfortable, and the full kitchen was great (don't mind the geckos, they run when you get close.) We love to cook and the big island has some of the best produce you'll find anywhere on earth. And the other 3 dogs really were super adorable, they would wait outside our door with their tails wagging, but were trained not to come in the house. It was definitely an experience..."},{"_id":"66658365","date":{"$date":"2016-03-24T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2670173","reviewer_id":"40333664","reviewer_name":"Tracy","comments":"The view is real and even better than the pictures can capture.

Cell service can be spotty depending on your carrier (Kristan let us know that ahead of time), for the most part wifi worked fine.  Kristan was very responsive in giving us directions and recommendations for grocery stores.

With directions in hand, the place is easily found, and you will soon discover the beautiful gardens and breathtaking views as you look around the grounds. Within a hour's drive from some excellent beaches and only a short distance from hiking and other activities, this spot is definitely one to book if you have the opportunity.

It's private, cozy and beautifully decorated. It's right next to the road leading to Waipio's valley so easy for us to hike down the valley. However I think it's better suited for the honeymoon couples or families seeking for privacy. Since there is no restaurant around and 30mins from the town, I don't recommend you to stay over 2 or 3 nights. Also, since the house has been listed on tripadvisor, yelp and lonely planet, I think it's a bit pricey and too commercialized. I'd prefer knowing local ppl with my airbnb stay, but Kristan didn't show up. It's just personal preference.

If you're looking for the Four Seasons experience you should stay there instead, but this is the Four Seasons of rustic Kukuihaele.  Like summer camp for adults in paradise.\r\n\r\nThe house was easy to find, but I don't recommend arriving in a downpour late at night like we did.  We immediately felt at home and we absolutely loved our 6 night stay.  So much so we are planning to return ASAP.\r\n\r\nAbout those dogs - they're the friendliest pack of poi dogs we've ever encountered in Hawaii.   All bark when you arrive, but no bite and pure love.  They adopted us into their pack for the week.\r\n\r\nThanks for keeping old Hawaii alive out on the edge of the island, Kristan.

Without a doubt the single best Airbnb experience we've ever had. The space is thoughtfully and elegantly designed, using so many (bug-proof) screens that you feel every breeze and are virtually outside. The residence, which is full of interesting objects and beautiful orchids, literally adjoins a river that feeds the falls, the sound of which is forever present inside the home. It must be one of only a handful of rentals, if not the only one, so close to the heart of Waipio - which is one of the most beautiful and awe-inspiring places on earth. It's more than a luxury accommodation - it's a serene, otherworldly experience that will forever change your perspective. Nearby Honoka'a town is also lovely, and Waipio Cookhouse, the local restaurant down the street from the Cliff House, is not to be missed. They claim, probably correctly, to be the only place on earth that makes pancakes using fresh Waipio valley poi, incredible bacon from valley pigs, etc. Farm to table in the truest sense, and best breakfast we've ever had.\n\nThanks Kristan and Waipio!"},{"_id":"145317533","date":{"$date":"2017-04-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2670173","reviewer_id":"43903027","reviewer_name":"Luke","comments":"When we arrived we were blown away by the view.

The house is \"walled off\" from all the surrounding houses and properties by the lush jungle vegetation, and in particular a massive wall of bamboo.  After checking in, we didn't see Kristan (or anyone) for the entire time we were there.  \n\nKristan also has some very nice landscaping, which must act like a buffet for butterflies because I've never seen so many (and different species) outside of a real butterfly sanctuary.  Beautiful and amazing.\n\nHonestly, the only downside of the property (if you could call it that) is the jungle sounds at night.  There are a a bunch of birds and other animals that start making noise around sunset and they don't let up until sunrise.  In my experience, it was much quieter around noon than around midnight.  If you are a person that is very sensitive to sound, you may not want to book here.  (Although neither I nor my wife had any trouble sleeping, at all.)\n\nOh, and that bathtub?  It's much, much, much better than the pictures show.  It has the same beautiful view as the rest of the house, with screens for walls to let in the wonderful tropical breezes.  If I could, I would live in that bathtub."},{"_id":"204374855","date":{"$date":"2017-10-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2670173","reviewer_id":"1651702","reviewer_name":"John","comments":"This house did not disappoint - great food nearby and of course the view.

Nice way to spend half the day. \nWi-fi without a password is great too. We saw a gecko as we were leaving the kitchen - our good luck paid off at a fine lunch at Merriman's. In Honokaa be sure to eat the acai bowl at Hina Rae's Cafe and Aulani Cafe was also great. But right around the corner from the house is the best - Waipi'o Cookhouse.

This place exceeded our expectations in every way.  The view is so beautiful it doesn't seem real, you keep staring out at the cliffs thinking it has to be a photograph; no, it's real life.  But it doesn't stop there.  The house itself is beautifully decorated, right down to the small details.  The cottage is small, but everything about it (lighting, windows, fan, kitchen, etc) makes sense.  The lofted room is super cool as well and has a sliding door for privacy.  We didn't use it, but if you're traveling with friends, it's certainly a bonus.  The house feels secluded and private, yet there are still nice dining and activity options very close by (5-15min).

Both the location and decor make it feel as if you've been transported to a different time and world, especially the loft area. It arguably has a better view than the main overlook down the road, although the rain and mist obscured the view for most of our stay. Thankfully, it was clear when we arrived and right before we left so we could soak it in! The beautiful garden frames the view too. Most of all, we loved the opportunities for nighttime baths with the sounds of rainfall all around.\n\nThe overhead fan made sleeping easier, although the lack of covers on some of the windows caused the whole place to become damp during the intense rainstorms, including the bed. The frogs and bugs were extremely loud at night, even with the windows closed, but we managed to sleep through the symphony of noise. Overall, it was a positive as it added to the tropical ambiance. Luckily we didn't have any problems with bugs indoors.\n\nThere is a wide selection of older movies in the bathroom closet (we watched The Importance of Being Earnest). We also relaxed while watching the World Series on the flatscreen. The Wi-Fi signal was a bit weak and spotty, but it worked most of the time. In the evenings, we were visited by a couple of feral cats who curled up on our car to sleep during the storm. We're guessing they have been fed by previous guests and expected the same.\n\nThe Cliff House is minutes away from Waipi'o Valley and not far from the town of Honokaa. We ate dinner at a gorgeous Italian restaurant called Cafe il Mundo in town, and there's a shop further down the road that sells locally grown coffee and macadamia nuts from Ahualoa Farms. \n\nThis is a romantic and truly secluded location that we would recommend to all honeymooners. Thanks for the unique memories!"},{"_id":"210925781","date":{"$date":"2017-11-11T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2670173","reviewer_id":"144511672","reviewer_name":"Tyler","comments":"As mentioned in most reviews, it would be hard to find a place to stay that would offer a better view.

Kristan gave us SPOT on directions to her place, the check in was EASY, she had darling vases of fresh flowers on the windowsill, and a sweet pup (that we named Charlie) that ran to greet us upon arrival. We enjoyed fresh coffee (beans, grinder, and coffee pot provided - stop on your way in for creamer) every morning and the soak tub on the screen porch by evening. We lit every candle in the house and enjoyed the rain falling outside. We used the ladder in the place as a drying rack for all of our clothes and ran the box fan to try and dry them out. Temps did drop in the evening and the rain made it feel colder than it was - pack a sweatshirt/sweatpants! While you're in town (Honokaa), stop at Gramma's Kitchen - one of our favorite meals of the trip + Cafe IL Mondo for the Hawaiian Pizza!

This place is beyond beautiful, which is why I keep coming back. If you are looking for a place to rest and be in peace— you MUST stay here. The home is very beautiful— I really enjoyed the jacuzzi, falling asleep to my coqui frog friends, and the views in the garden and of Waipio are breathtakingly spectacular!! There’s also lots to do in the area: Waipio is just around the corner so you can take a trip down into the valley, or you can visit the town of Honoka’a and grab some ice cream while doing a little shopping. You can go horseback riding, and Waimea is not too far so you can journey over there and have a nice afternoon on their ranches or enjoy a lovely meal at Merriman’s. This is overall one of my favorite homes on Big Island so much that I chose it to celebrate my birthday. It is very special to me and I’m sure it will be to you too, if you choose to visit. I definitely recommend this home to all. Thank you Kristan once again for opening your home to me/us. I look forward to visiting again in the future.

My husband was like a little kid checking out the house and the view! We loved the eclectic Hawaiian decor, from the pottery to the vintage photos. Kristan’s description of the property is spot on. The view of the Waipi’o valley, the ocean and, on a clear day, Maui is breathtaking. We had a couple of gecko sightings around the house(they are harmless and adorable and keep the critters away!) and there were the 2 sweetest kitties that came to visit in the evenings. We walked to the Waipi’o Valley lookout (about a 10 minute walk), drove into the Valley in our rented jeep(that was so much fun!) and went horseback riding down there as well. The little store/art gallery nearby is great for finding Hawaiian made gifts. Just keep in mind that this is a rural area. We had to drive to Honoka’a to get gas, we drove to Waimea the first night for dinner because we waited too late to go to someplace local(7:30!). \nThis is a great place and I’d recommend it to anyone looking for a private, relaxing getaway with a most incredible view."},{"_id":"331484108","date":{"$date":"2018-10-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2670173","reviewer_id":"157273919","reviewer_name":"Ben","comments":"This home took our breath away!!

We did not need it with the nice cool breeze through the house at night, but the delightful sounds of the jungle may bother light sleepers.

The nearest places we found to eat/buy groceries are about a 30min round trip, so it's worth stopping on your way in. The kitchen is well stocked with pans, utensils etc but doesn't have a microwave, and there is no BBQ outside.\n\nWe loved our time at the hideaway and would definitely recommend it to those who want some alone time away from the hustle and bustle.

Needless to say, we like it very  much. It is near the end of the road leading to Waipio Valley and has an off-the-grid vibe. However, utilities, including fast WiFi, were reliable. The hot water was hot enough, but just. I think the on-demand heater is undersized of not set correctly. Filling the spa/tub with hot water, and no cold water, gives a plenty warm soaking with breathless views. (See my earlier review, and those of others, for a description of the first class views.) This place is best suited for a couple, although the loft could sleep another couple or a few kids. I would not recommend this, because the loft's ladder might be a bit of a challenge in the middle of the night. The grounds are a well manicured colorful garden that makes you feel like you're staying in a bouquet. We saw surprisingly few mosquitoes and didn't need to use bug repellent at all during our stay."},{"_id":"363034128","date":{"$date":"2018-12-27T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2670173","reviewer_id":"54485457","reviewer_name":"Katherine","comments":"The view was spectacular!

A baby crib will be provided when requested. The location is also convenient, just walking distance to Taksim and to the airport bus station (Havabus) and to the metro station. You have to be ready to walk uphill though when leaving the house since it is located in a small neighborhood. There is a small bakery right infront of the house, very convenient to grab fresh bread and a bit of grocery. Sefa responsed to every query we have even just to borrow an adapter from him. I also like the fact that we are provided with a small vacuum cleaner, so it’s a breeze cleaning up since it’s a small space.

Como uma dica para os visitante da cidade: Pessoas que se dizem Uber e que esperam passageiros  dentro do aeroporto  e lhe abordam falando baixo, não são confiáveis: O que nos atendeu, cobrou R$ 100,00 do Galeão para Copacabana. Após, utilizando o aplicativo, descobrimos que o percurso não chega a R$70,00, portanto, cuidado, MELHOR utilizar o aplicativo, tirar o print do valor apresentado e após, caso o valor ultrapasse, basta apresentar o print ao motorista. No mais, todos os demais pontos visitados com saída do apartamento, não pagamos valores acima de R$15,00. Ou seja, excelente custo benefício.

Pero el ambiente ha cambiado mucho, sobre todo, en verano. Su playa es una de las más animadas de la ciudad tanto de día como de noche, cuando abren los chiringuitos y bares musicales instalados en la misma arena donde se puede ir a cenar o a tomar una copa hasta altas horas de la madrugada.Junto a esta cara moderna, la Barceloneta sigue oliendo a sal y a ambiente marinero. Para muchos es todo un lujo que todavía se conserve un barrio de este tipo en una ciudad como Barcelona. Y es que resulta algo extraño que junto a calles estrechas, húmedas y ennegrecidas por el salitre, convivan alguno de los mejores restaurantes de la ciudad y atraquen lujosos barcos.","notes":"Se recomienda comprar agua envasada (evitar beber agua del grifo), se dispone de jarra con filtro para el agua","transit":"Estacion de metro Barceloneta linea amarilla a 5 minutos caminando, autobus parada playa Barceloneta Nº 59,45,D20, caminando se puede llegar a los barrios de alrededor como el Born,Gotico,Rabal, Plaza Cataluñia.

She keeps the house clean and the common area was decorated nicely, the balcony too. Karla was very responsive over text and email, and I think she even shifted her plans around a bit so that she could meet me when I arrived in town rather than having me wait with my bags. She's a kind host. There are also a couple of pets--a Chihuahua and a shy, skittish cat--but they stayed mostly in her room.\r\n\r\nThe room is small and most of the space is occupied by the bed, which was comfortable and clean. There's a small area to hang up clothes as well. Other than that there wasn't much room in the room, but as I mentioned before there's a common area and a little balcony, so the small room isn't a problem. The kitchen and bathrooms were clean throughout my stay.\r\n\r\nThe apartment is located right by the beach, maybe a minute or two to walk there, and a short walk from the subway station (5 minutes). There are no shortage of bars and restaurants around the apartment, and Karla was able to suggest where to go. It's a busy part of town during the day and evening, but I didn't find it too loud at night. I recommend staying here if it's available.\r\n"},{"_id":"15011140","date":{"$date":"2014-06-30T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2681468","reviewer_id":"6202623","reviewer_name":"Ray","comments":"Karla is a great person and great host.

Both of them stayed to themselves while she was gone and came alive when she returned.\r\n\r\nThe room offered on Airbnb is large and has a large bed with plenty of plugs. The apartment itself is a two bedroom with a kitchen and living room area. The toilet is separate from the shower. The views and cross breeze are great. You can see the beach, and Karla keeps the whole place very clean.\r\n\r\nThe neighborhood is safe and offers everything you need from a large grocery store, to a mercado, to corner stores, to restaurants and bars. I liked being able to easily access the beach around the clock. The apartment is also very close to major attractions. It only took me 15 minutes to walk to La Rambla, and 30 minutes to walk to La Sagrada Familia. I like to walk, but if you don’t the metro is only a short walk away and the bus is close by too.\r\n\r\nAll in all a great way to experience the beach and Barcelona from a local’s perspective.

A fridge with some water and beers. Rodrigo said I could use anything that's in the apartment! (OK, I replenished the water, but it was great to have it there to begin with). \r\n\r\nHe even left his longboard and said I could use it whenever I want for rides along the beaches (which are a very short walk by the way). \r\n\r\nOther cool things:\r\n- TV has cable as well as an Apple TV box with a Netflix. House of cards season 3 was just released when I was here and was able to see it all in a weekend binge. \r\n- A portable speaker to play music\r\n- etc etc\r\n\r\nIt just seems like Rodrigo is the rare AirBnb host that not only wants to make money off of his property but actually cares for people to have a good time.

It was home for about 8 days to my mom and myself and we both were very comfortable and happy here. Rodrigo is an amazing host. He is always attentive to your needs and has in place so many amenities that you will not find elsewhere. From the decor to the snacks he leaves to welcome guests, Rodrigo really works hard to provide the most welcoming and cozy experience for his guests. The bed is very comfortable and easily sleeps two. If you feel like watching TV while you rest, Rodrigo also has tons of options for you to watch what you want (cable, AppleTV, Chromecast - all of which we used at one point or another lol). We were there in July, so it was even cool enough not to need the A/C. We kept the window open and the fan on at night and during the day and we still felt very cool. The location of the studio is also ideal. We walked every day less than 10 minutes each way to Copacabana and Ipanema beaches and the walks were always very pleasant. Getting transportation around town was also a breeze! There are so many taxis and buses that pass by even just across the street and the metro station is very close-by as well. On top of that there are tons of little shops, restaurants and farmers' markets, all again within walking distance. I HIGHLY recommend this place if you want to be in a nice, quiet neighborhood, close to the beach. I already know I will be back here the next time I go to Rio :)  "},{"_id":"42295051","date":{"$date":"2015-08-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2683147","reviewer_id":"3509669","reviewer_name":"Fally","comments":"Seriously this appartment is perfect.

Rodrigo has accomodated us when my flight was cancelled and offered to stay and extra night for us not to loose our money. The appartment itself was very located. Two steps aways from the metro and with a bunch of buses passing right in front. The neighborhood is very safe and 2 steps away from the beach. The flat was super clean and had everything you needed inside.

Al estar a algo menos de dos cuadras de la avenida Nuestra Señora de Copacabana es muy silencioso y no se escucha el tránsito de estas grandes avenidas. Por otra parte, el barrio es muy seguro por la noche y hay lugares fantásticos muy cerca para comer casi a cualquier hora. *El edificio es silencioso, los vecinos son muy respetuosos y dentro del departamento no se sienten olores de la cocina de otros habitantes ni que provengan del exterior. *El interior es muy acogedor, está súper equipado, tiene aire acondicionado, ventilador, calentador de toallas, heladera, un anafe eléctrico para cocinar, microondas, cafetera, minipimer, pava eléctrica y una batería de cocina súper completa. La única crítica que se le puede hacer a la cocina es que es un poco chiquita y a veces resulta complejo moverse ahí dentro. *Tiene una cama muy cómoda que está bien ubicada frente a un TV alucinante donde se puede reposar después de un día de playa. *Dispusimos siempre de juegos de sábanas y toallas nuevos y limpios. *El baño tiene mampara, espejos y bidet. *Pudimos salir sin llaves y totalmente tranquilos gracias al sistema de seguridad de la puerta. *Recargamos la tarjeta del metro que nos dejaste y nos desplazamos sin problemas. *Todo funciona correctamente, no tuvimos ningún contratiempo. *Por último, Rodrigo nos respondió con toda amabilidad antes de contratar, luego de la reserva y estuvo disponible también durante nuestra estadía, lo que nos dio mucha tranquilidad.\nDesde el primer minuto hasta el último disfrutamos de dos semanas de placer en este departamento impecable y bien decorado, como se ve en las fotos, lo que nos hizo sentir como en casa. Y una vez allá descubrimos que podríamos haber ido solo con malla, ojotas y algo de ropa, porque encontramos todo lo demás: secador de pelo, paraguas, pareos, sombreros, plancha e incluso algunos artículos de perfumería.\nPara quienes vayan a Río, les contamos que hay wifi gratis en el aeropuerto Galeao y se pueden pedir un Uber que cuesta unos 45 reales hasta el departamento o bien pueden tomarse el bus 2018 (también llamado Frescao) por 15 reales por persona, en la puerta misma del aeropuerto, que los deja a media cuadra del departamento.\nPor todo esto, la próxima vez que vayamos a Río ya tenemos elegido el lugar de nuestra estadía. ¡Esperamos que sea pronto!

First off, it's in between two of the cities most major beaches (Copacabana - 5 min walk) and (Ipanema - 10 min walk). The living space is great. There is nice sized bed with comfy sheets and pillows. A great air conditioner that can have the whole apartment cool in a  few minutes. A smart TV with easy access to Netflix and Youtube. An ironing board and iron are on hand. Also a convenient tea and coffee maker. The refrigerator has a filtered water pitcher you can use. The bathroom is also good with a nice shower that can have hot water in the switch of a button. I am an adventurer and I went to many of the cities museums, surfing, mountain climbing and exploring in general. I suggest uber as the best way to get around. Rodrigo's central location makes this perfect. The most expensive uber I paid for was from the airport. This came up to 45 reals which is equivalent to about $15 dollars (Not bad). The place in itself, its popular surroundings and central location was great, but so was Rodrigo. He was so helpful with the pdf emails he sent out about the apartment and the popular destinations nearby. He also has a handy map in the apartment that shows you these destinations if you want  a more hands on approach. Also, although Rodrigo was at work he always responded to my messages fast, like when I could not find the iron, or spare towels in the apartment. Not to mention my flight arrived at 10 in the morning and Rodrigo let me check in early so I did not have to wait until 3pm. Overall Rodrigo was a great host and I truly enjoyed my stay at his home. I would recommend anyone to Rodrigo's place if they want to have a great stay in Rio."},{"_id":"243618543","date":{"$date":"2018-03-16T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"2683147","reviewer_id":"167633617","reviewer_name":"Santiago","comments":"Nos hospedamos 9 días y nuestra estadía fue realmente inmejorable.

Everything seems to be newly renovated, and it was very clean. The modern kitchen is stylish, yet functional with new appliances and nice touches like a bonsai tree on the counter, and a Berkey water filter. There is a large deck off the kitchen that was the perfect spot for breakfast or a glass of wine in the evening. We checked in and out very easily, and the host was responsive if we had questions.

Location is great and apt is v. nice but the posting was inaccurate. The host contacted me the night before (!?) we were to arrive with the wrong dates stating I should book more time, that I was also to pay extra ie over $100 more than the stated price because my husband was coming and yes, there's on site parking, but for yet another fee of $25 a day. \nTo sum it up, stay true to your original post, roll your costs into the overall rate and if your going to have your contact who meets us on site give us a map for street parking make sure it tells guests you have to move your car at 8am (!) on a weekday or get towed and that street parking is impossible. Also, if your going to take a picture of our drivers licenses there better be a good reason for it other than 'that's what we do\".

Durante nuestra estancia, solo tuvimos un pequeño problema con la lavadora y en seguida acudieron a resolverlo, estuvieron muy pendientes y atentas! Respecto a la zona, está un poco alejado del centro, pero se puede ir en coche, y luego también hay una linea de autobús cerca o directamente taxi o uber, que salen muy bien de precio. El apartamento está muy cerca del Duero, y tiene un super y un bar al lado, a más zonas del barrio mejor ya no ir. ¡Muchas gracias Jessica por tu hospitalidad!"},{"_id":"315324806","date":{"$date":"2018-08-28T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"26897800","reviewer_id":"191929396","reviewer_name":"Juan Y Adriana","comments":"Todo genial, muchísimas gracias."},{"_id":"319352692","date":{"$date":"2018-09-06T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"26897800","reviewer_id":"126657180","reviewer_name":"Sandra","comments":"Correcto"},{"_id":"321467173","date":{"$date":"2018-09-10T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"26897800","reviewer_id":"214283183","reviewer_name":"Alejandra","comments":"apartamento bonito, diáfano e impecable. la anfitriona contesta super rápido y es atenta y amable."},{"_id":"323782014","date":{"$date":"2018-09-16T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"26897800","reviewer_id":"43513106","reviewer_name":"Silvia","comments":"El apartamento de Jessica es ideal si buscan un lugar tranquilo para pasar unos días en Porto.

Knight is a most friendly and courteous host, he is always quick to respond to any inquiries both before booking and during our stay. This room is a good size for the two of us in Hong Kong standards, with space to move around and to put our suitcases. It is cute and looks just like the pictures. The bed is comfortable, and even though the Hong Kong standard bed length is a little short for us (we are both tall), there is room at the end of the bed to stretch our legs. This is a major criterion when I was searching for a room. \n\nWe were also surprised at how quiet the room is - because the windows face the back side of the building and away from the main street, there is barely any street noise at all day or night. As this is the last room at the end of the corridor, there is neighbor on only one side - this is nice as the walls are thin and sound from the next room (shower) can be heard. The location is also superb, being in the heart of the city, with all kinds of eateries, shops, MTR (subway), buses, taxi and Star Ferry. Laundry service is available just a short walk away, and there is currency exchange right next to the building entrance with the best rate in the block. We also feel very safe going in and out of the apartment and building at all hours. \n\nThis a great room in terms of location, space, comfort and value. We would love to stay here again in the future."},{"_id":"347143368","date":{"$date":"2018-11-11T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"26916127","reviewer_id":"111495536","reviewer_name":"Ila","comments":"The location is great and very close to the MTR station.

Highly recommended. We didn't try public transport, but if you have a car, it is much better to escape from overcrowded city ceneter and in 15min you are back in the centre of all the attractions.

Didn’t end up sleeping, didn’t even shower. \nI arrived about 9pm, left 8am the next morning. He justified by saying it’s only $17/night but with the cleaning, service etc, it ended up costing $48.02 for 1 night. Didn’t use any of the amenities due to uncleanliness. \nI didn’t meet him only spoke on the phone. He seemed nice \u0026 was communicating throughout the night \u0026 asked me take pictures of the whatever wasn’t clean because he needed evidence for the cleaning company, which I did \u0026 sent it to him.

Very, very clean and Tim and Mel are so kind and easy to chat with. They also give you your own space if that’s what you like. I had a lovely gift basket of muesli bars and crisps on the bed when I arrived. The whole area is brand new, and buildings are still going up, so there’s a bit of construction going on around the place (Sept 2018), however, it didn’t ruin my stay. The apartment building Tim and Mel’s place is in is very beautiful - quiet too!\n\nLocal tips: I’d recommend popping into Textbook Boulangerie which is about 200m away - amazing French Pastries. Grounds of Alexandria isn’t far either - hip cafe/coffee options. The new library is worth popping into as well - it’s quite a spectacle at night.\n\nWoolworths is virtually on your doorstep too.\n\nThanks for a great stay!"},{"_id":"328675745","date":{"$date":"2018-09-27T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"27009904","reviewer_id":"212978581","reviewer_name":"Yufan","comments":"Nice person\u0026 clean area, we are so appreciate for your welcoming."},{"_id":"329022430","date":{"$date":"2018-09-28T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"27009904","reviewer_id":"21890350","reviewer_name":"Massimiliano","comments":"Very nice hosts.

Die Wohnung ist absolut empfehlenswert und wir würden die Wohnung wieder buchen."},{"_id":"304770228","date":{"$date":"2018-08-10T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"27023392","reviewer_id":"67169498","reviewer_name":"Marco","comments":"appartamento bellissimo, arredato molto bene,  molto spazioso e pulito. la vista dal balcone è fantastica ed è dotato di tutti i comfort, anche lavatrice, elettrodomestici di ultima generazione. anche in 4 si sta comodi. è fuori dal centro ma in 5 minuti si arriva alla metro ed in 20 minuti si arriva in centro.

This is my first trip abroad with my wife and it was possibly the best choice we could have made. Pedro was very helpful, kind and knowledgeable on what Porto had to offer. The location of the apartment is right in the middle of Porto, between the airport, beach and city centre.
