You could walk to the beach in less than 20 mins if you wanted to. Plenty of shops and restaurants nearby too. There is street parking if you need it. I usually found a place a few blocks away to the southeast which was fine.\n\nThe place itself had all my basic needs covered. Bed, desk, wifi, shared bathroom with shower. Jimmy was responsive to my messages and sent simple directions for checking in. It was clean and comfortable. Note that this being Hawaii, there wasn't any AC used; instead, just open windows and fans. It got a bit humid at points but it wasn't bad or anything; just all part of the experience! There was a fan in the room that I turned on at night for sleeping, which helped. The room didn't come with a towel but I sent a message to Jimmy and asked him for one, which he provided. \n\nThe place was good value for the money and I would stay here again if I could. Other than the flight, almost everything else in Hawaii was cheaper than traveling around Seattle and Vancouver, which was a big surprise for me. There's no reason not to come back soon. Thanks Jimmy!\n\nLocal area tip: Rainbow Drive-in is about a 3 minute walk from the apartment, and is a prime spot for a classic plate lunch if you want to get a sense of what the locals eat. Not the best plate lunches out there but a solid place to start!"},{"_id":"298858673","date":{"$date":"2018-07-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19660411","reviewer_id":"79869463","reviewer_name":"Garrett","comments":"This place was a great way of staying right near Waikiki, without having to pay a ton for a hotel.

I was born and raised on the island and I have to say that this home is in one of the best kept areas.   Easy access to anywhere you wanna venture to but secluded enough to have a bit of privacy away from the hustle and bustle.   Super clean, the bathroom is awesome and the tub has (Website hidden by Airbnb) amazing,  compact refrigerator/freezer in room, flat screen TV with Netflix etc,  mirrored full size closet with hangers, the whole place is either laminate or tile flooring so it’s easy to cleanup if you happen to track a little bit of sand inside, the bed is new and it was perfect for us (not too soft), the AC is fantastic and super quiet with a remote control,  Kailua Beach Park and Lanikai Beach are close and great for relaxing!  Lots of places to eat in the area,  grocery stores close by and I can’t forget to mention Starbucks for coffee lovers, if you don’t wanna leave to get coffee a Keurig is provided with k-cups and assorted tea as well, laundromat nearby and you will be blown away by its cleanliness, ample parking on the street is an understatement  we never had a problem and I promise you, anywhere else would likely be an issue, you will be greeted at the top of the stairs by their doggies saying hello from behind the glass/screen door to the main house but you won’t hear them any other time and their cats, well they’re cats, you won’t hear them or even see them most days   if you go to Waikiki Beach (20 minutes away) park at the Zoo and walk across the street it’s $1 an hour but parking is scarce in waikiki so it’s your best bet.  I know this was long and super detailed but I want everyone to know how much we enjoyed our 5 days here.  Finally,  Amylynne  and Christina are awesome hosts and we would highly recommend staying here and hope to return someday"},{"_id":"290608941","date":{"$date":"2018-07-14T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19664691","reviewer_id":"64203237","reviewer_name":"Serenity","comments":"Beautiful neighborhood.

Not only did the room not look as clean as pictured but it was also scorching hot. The drawer that is in the room is on it’s last life. Everything about it was unattractive. Let’s move onto the bathroom( that is a whole other story). I was traveling all day so I was so excited to shower! Not only was I turned off by the dirty bath mat and the black mold in the creases of the shower , when I went to turn on the water the shower head was spitting water from every direction except the direct I was in. It was horrible, I had a better chance at showering in the sink. Mind you one of the ladies that was also there would be in the bathroom for 60 minutes, taking tea baths leaving the bathroom an even bigger mess. It is so funny to me that there was two women that go and clean the parts of the apartment that no one uses. My last straw was when they started smoking weed in the house when I had my baby there. I contacted the owner and demanded a refund for the remaining days that I didn’t use because there’s no way I could stay in that environment, this jackass responded and told me he would only give me a refund if someone books for those days, meaning he did not want to give me my money back. I had to call Airbnb and wait 4 days to receive my money back!!! There’s no parking so good luck if you have a car. Also hopefully it doesn’t rain when you are there because the balcony will play you beats all night. I couldn’t hardly sleep because of the metal on the balcony. I had to lay a shirt down so that the water wouldn’t hit it directly so I could catch some sleep. This place is just a ghetto hot mess, I agree with other people who have been here, yes it’s nice if you plan for a cheap sleep and go but it’s not the type of place you should bring a date or even relax because the mattress isn’t even comfortable.  To be honest I wouldn’t stay here again and never in my entire life would I recommend someone with two senses to do so either. I forgot to mention, I had to put my own sheets on the bed because the ones that were there had dust on them!"},{"_id":"241539162","date":{"$date":"2018-03-09T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19664709","reviewer_id":"176163472","reviewer_name":"Jessica","comments":"The flat rent by Bloz has all necessary equipment needed for a short stay in NY and secure.

There isn't a TV in the living room but when we're all the time outside to visit NYC, you don't need it.\n\nThe flat is well located, it's really 15 minutes from the nearest metro station (Broadway, line N or W). It's around 20 minutes from Time Square so it's close to Manhattan for a cheaper price. There are Mc Do, Subway and a Market shop at the end of the street, which is quite convenient.\nBut what marks my stay in this flat was the nice Swiss girls I met there, staying in another room.

Die Wohnung besteht aus drei Zimmern, die alle vermietet werden, das Badezimmer wird gemeinsam genutzt. Die Einrichtung ist simpel und ohne jeden Charme, mehr als einen Schlafplatz findet man hier nicht. Die Kommunikation mit dem Vermieter, den wir nicht zu Gesicht bekamen, funktioniert zuverlässig. Für New Yorker Verhältnisse gutes Preisleistungsverhältnis. Wer mehr als eine rein zweckmäßige Bleibe sucht, sollte sich aber anderweitig umschauen."},{"_id":"269609739","date":{"$date":"2018-05-27T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19664709","reviewer_id":"103317319","reviewer_name":"Stephanie","comments":"Good location and neighborhood, room was ok as showed in pictures, AC working fine, but some odor at the room. The apartment had other guests at the room 2 and the bathroom wasn’t cleaned at all, very dirty bathtube and no soap or toothpaste. Even the Room 2 had guests, I’d expect the host clean the bathroom because he knew we were coming to stay one night. The host doesn’t greet you in person, you get a message about the code and what to do with your trash, what is fine for me, but he sent different codes for me and for the person who was sharing the room with me. Luckily we did check in together but it could’ve been a trouble for us trying to reach the host late at night. \nYou have access to the living room and small kitchen, what was good enough with AC working (summer time). \nIt’s a good place to stay one or two nights. Good price, good location the only thing that I didn’t like was the bathroom so dirty."},{"_id":"274251940","date":{"$date":"2018-06-08T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19664709","reviewer_id":"35314457","reviewer_name":"Wendy","comments":"es muy práctico pues solo entras y tienes tu habitación lista."},{"_id":"280579878","date":{"$date":"2018-06-23T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19664709","reviewer_id":"191190224","reviewer_name":"Kenzie","comments":"The apartment is very simple, but is clean, tidy, and straightforward. A quick 7 minute walk from the Broadway station, it's no trouble at all to get back and forth from the main island. The other roommates were equally tidy and respectful of the space, which is a bonus. The little outdoor balcony is also great for relaxing and people watching too! Definitely recommend this space to a low maintenance traveler looking for a weekend escape. Thank you for a wonderful weekend Bloz!

It was what was in the pictures. The shared bathroom was uncomfortable, especially when I arrived and the shower was clogged from someone’s hair for two days, and the water didn’t drain properly. The bedroom ac also was hardly pushing out any cold hair, especially on 90degree days it was musky in the living space. The value is decent for what you get. It’s a place to rest your head, just to visit various locations in New York City. Also had items stolen from me in the bathroom. So I had to bring everything I needed back into my room and lock the door. It’s what you’d expect from multiple guests sharing a living space.

The parking spot was clutch. We ended up not using our car at all (walked/took metro). As a side note, if you are sensitive to cigarette smell be aware that the hallways do have a strong odor.

The fact that a parking spot is included is big a bonus. The apartment appeared as advertised. However, it was extremely filthy. I was able to inform the host and show him, so hopefully he will address and rectify this with the cleaning company he has hired. The most problematic issue was arriving in 30+ degree weather with no a/c installed as advertised (which was a main criteria in selecting this place). It was quite unbearable. \nWhile Karim was very prompt and polite in his exchanges leading to our check-in, once this issue had to be addressed I was very unimpressed with how it was handled. After several exchanges trying to address this legitimate concern, which disrupted most of our evening, arrangements were finally made to come and install the a/c that night. In the end it only made a slight difference, given that its an older window unit. If you plan to use the kitchen, be aware that some essentials are missing; including the proper items to wash and dry dishes. Otherwise, the bed and pull out couches are very comfortable for sleeping, and the highlight for us that mostly compensated for the other disappointments was the amazing rooftop patio and pool on the top floor. If this host is able to rectify the few issues addressed, this place has a lot of potential."},{"_id":"273265784","date":{"$date":"2018-06-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19680142","reviewer_id":"117474674","reviewer_name":"Monisha","comments":"This place is perfect for a short trip to Montreal!

The 4th level is an attic with 2 twin beds, accessed via a steep ladder. There is no privacy for sleeping, proving awkward for 2 couples. The bathroom doors are barely 5' in height. \n\nThe host assured me that parking was nearby. In fact, the apartment is located in a pedestrian-only zone, accessed via steep sidewalks. Virtually impossible to find via (Hidden by Airbnb) maps. The host did not provide directions.\nImpossible to find. After 3 calls to management company, we parked at a nearby church and a concierge walked us to the place. He was very nice, but had never been in the apartment.\n\nThe outdoor terrace is lovely and the location is very good, in the historic center. \n\nOn the last night, we were awakened in the middle of the night and two people, unannounced, came into the apartment! They claimed to be from the management company and were bringing extra glassware. This was very frightening and completely unacceptable. \n\nIt might be OK for a short couple with good knees.

Access is through stairs so if you have heavy luggage then be prepared to hike down a few steps.  Since we were at the end of the year we found parking in the street behind the cathedral but this option might not be available in summer.  So if you have a car be prepared to pay for a parking.\nThe apartment is an open space on 4 levels.  So this means that there is not much privacy.  Also when we arrived (Dec 28) the apartment was very cold especially because the bottom floor is not heated (maybe there could be away to isolate better the bottom floor from the rest of the apt).  We would have appreciated the apartment having been warmed for a few hours before our arrival. Also there is no heater in the two bathrooms so they stay very very cold and if you take a good shower, the mist will take ages to dissipate...  \nSince all heaters had to be turned on we found that the electricity was tripping off when we were using the oven.\nFinally we had only one key while this place is for four people and you would expect to have at least 2 keys.\nIn brief, an incredible location BUT this is vastly overpriced for the service offered."},{"_id":"231076630","date":{"$date":"2018-01-30T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19699590","reviewer_id":"103861704","reviewer_name":"Handerson","comments":"Amazing view and well localized place.

There are numerous steep stairs to negotiate (inside and out) which would be difficult for the less able. There is a musty damp smell on the ground floor which renders this area unusable, other than for access. Limited sofa seating on the first floor. Access to the toilet and shower room is tricky for tall people - over 5 feet. Remember to duck! The beds on the attic floor would only suit older children able to easily climb the stair access.\n\nPositives - it’s a unique and stylish apartment in the heart of Porto with fantastic outside space and an amazing view of the bridge and port houses across the river. In our opinion this far outweighed the negatives. \n\nIn conclusion we would definitely recommend the apartment to a couple or a family with one or two older kids."},{"_id":"290908745","date":{"$date":"2018-07-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19699590","reviewer_id":"25529131","reviewer_name":"Christina","comments":"Beautiful apartment.

Now you find a fancy modern living in old stonewalls, which is extremely charming and special! A little bit steep steps guide from one level to the next, but its safe and good to handle! The last steps to the upper bedroom are more a ladder, so thats the kids-room or for the sportive ones! But all this is owed to the shape of the house and having it unique has its price! ;o))) The real secret of the house though is the \"Terrasse\"! Its mindblowing! Different levels of old stone-framed gardens, fully outdoor furnished, cause this, folks,  is the real living room of the house! You are directly facing the main attraction of porto, watching it in the different shades of daylight! In fact, we were sitting a full day there till late night,  just enjoying this breathtaking view with some breakfast, a little lunch and finally some good cold cuts with a glass of portwine! And spotting tourists on the bridge, that were obviously a bit jealous, watching us happy ones! If you  want a special and most memorable stay in Porto, this house is first choice!"},{"_id":"338411966","date":{"$date":"2018-10-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19699590","reviewer_id":"161168489","reviewer_name":"Carla","comments":"Muy buena localización y una terraza genial"},{"_id":"347995930","date":{"$date":"2018-11-12T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19699590","reviewer_id":"5800635","reviewer_name":"Luisa","comments":"The flat is exactly as advertised, and more.

Highly recommend. \nMy only complaint would be the bed and pillows. If they were replaced with firmer it would be perfection."}]}

Next, there was a very strong smell of gasoline and after searching the place, we found multiple gas cans and trays filled with exposed gasoline in the boiler room.  We took it upon ourselves to bring all of it into the backyard and out of the place because Marian had already left to work. We then left the door open for a few hours to air out the place.  While this brought some relief, the fumes were still present and we assume it may be because the gasoline was stored in the basement for some time and their is spillage that has to be cleaned very well. We were very concerned about the health hazards of inhaling the fumes and the likelihood of a house fire.  Gasoline should never be stored in a house or near a house.  This baffled us!\n\nSame night, we discovered that the water function is very poor - the pressure is very poor making it difficult to wash my hair and too much time needed to rinse off.  It was also very difficult to adjust (and maintain) the water temperate to where needed for showering, brushing your teeth and washing dishes.  This created a very frustrating experience.\n\nThe bathroom includes a very small and shabby stand up Durastall.  It makes it very difficult to move around in, the drain clogs, there was concern about what was coming up from the drain while still in the shower and we had to use a towel to prevent flooding due to overflowing water.  \n\nThe lighting in the place was very poor as some of the ceiling fixtures had light bulbs, most didn't and none of the light bulbs were consistent offering different levels of lighting that made it difficult to read or work on the laptops and, they were all eye sores. \n\nHowever, the place was clean and spacious, queen size bed, clean bedding and towels, there was a kitchen table that seats 4, clean fridge, sink is available, toaster, coffee machine, microwave (however it was not cleaned) and an electric skillet that actually worked out well for light cooking.      \n\nIt's an experience like crashing in someone's basement with a few basic needs.  For the price of $50 we didn't complain about anything because you get what you pay for however, storing gasoline in a room on the same level of the space being rented is a major issue. We couldn't understand why Marian has not taken this into consideration as I have seen it mentioned in other reviews. It goes without saying that gasoline should not be stored in a home.  If that problem can be fixed, I would recommend Marian's space to someone who is not expecting a lot, just the basics and at no more than $50 per night."},{"_id":"242298110","date":{"$date":"2018-03-11T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19786915","reviewer_id":"171224750","reviewer_name":"Laura","comments":"..."},{"_id":"277545279","date":{"$date":"2018-06-16T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19786915","reviewer_id":"69268383","reviewer_name":"Lacey","comments":"The host canceled this reservation 15 days before arrival.

Within a 7min walk of the home is a Provigo (chain mid-range grocery) two large parks with wading pools, tennis courts, basketball and baseball spaces, and even publicly available piano to play. Near one park is a fantastic breakfast place and a row of shops on Rue Beaubien including artisianal cheese and meat shops. So you needn't travel far to live like a native and entertain the children.\n\nThe home itself easily sleeps 7 (we were 5 including 3 children ages 7 to 12) and provides adequate cooking, dining, and sitting space. Clean, bright, and cozy, we felt right at home. \n\nSituated on the main/basement floors of a 3-storey walk-up, the main floor features three bedrooms and an office we repurposed as a fourth bedroom, using the trundle bed from one of the children's bedrooms. No air-conditioning, but the windows and fans proved more than adequate for the mild weather this week (no highs above 28C).\n\nThe bathrooms are nice, especially the newly remodelled basement bath with walk-in shower and attractive vanity. The basement also provides another bedroom and a sitting area with couch and futon facing a large TV; a comfortable space that could easily sleep two.\n\nWe are sorry our trip had to end. We would gladly stay here again. So glad we found this spot and hosts!"}]}

Stunning views of the city from the balcony outside the uppermost, Swiss-chalet style bedroom.  We had four adult males staying in the house and we all had plenty of space.  For a group of people, it's also very economical: much cheaper than trying to find a similar hotel suite for the same price.  Perfect for a short or extended stay in Sydney, and surprisingly tranquil for such a central location.

The townhouse was exactly like the photos.  Beautiful and clean space in the perfect area. The views from the balconies onto the city skyline were such a nice touch. Like a secret hiding spot! The neighborhood is safe, scenic, and quiet.  Once you walk a couple blocks there are a bunch of restaurants, bars, cafes, corner stores, and anything you would need. Great nightlife on Victoria Street! \n\nThe main issues was some basic TLC. The bath towels need to be replaced.  Missing some essentials, such as hand towels in bathrooms and hand soap as well.  \n\nThere were also no screens on windows + the no AC threw us all off.  Not sure why there were no screens on the windows, especially since we would need them open to let cooler air in.  We were worried about bugs coming in, so made sure all food was kept in the refrigerator.  Maybe this is a Sydney thing?  One of the couches in the living room definitely needs to be replaced.\n\nBesides these doable updates, our stay was perfect.  We really enjoyed the space, had fun sitting around the beautiful dining room table eating breakfast that we comfortably made in the very spacious kitchen, and had a nice sleep every night in the bed.  The Townhouse is affordable, great location, and comfortable.

The house isn’t ideal for people with any mobility issues (the main bathroom isn’t accommodating \u0026 the old knees were a bit tired by the end of the weekend!)\nWe stayed in early November, which was ideal.

And the beds were comfy. Now for the negatives - and there are a few. First, the house needs a thorough clean and paint: the walls are dirty, the carpets are dirty, the kitchen needs a scrub. There's no air-con, and when the heat reaches 39 degrees as it did when we were there, that was an issue. Yes, we knew that when we made the booking, but at least provide decent fans that don't sound like a jet engine taking off. The downstairs shower leaked every time it was used; the upstairs bathroom was ancient and needs replacing, and the bathroom itself had saloon doors - privacy be damned. The sofas in the lounge need replacing: one was worn, the other like sitting on a rock. The dining table and chairs were passable. The four bedrooms felt grimy; only three had doors, the fourth wide open at the top of a staircase - far from ideal. The towels were threadbare. Plus, with 8 of staying, I would expect at least 8 of everything: cutlery, wine glasses, plates, water glasses, mugs - there were not. We arrived an hour early and the house was still dirty from the previous tennants, with towels on the floor, rubbish in the property. When we came back two hours later, it still wasn't ready. The spare keys were not where they should have been. Jeremy showed up the following day with flowers as an apology and spare keys - but we had no vase to put the flowers in. This house COULD be great - it has the space for 8, two lovely balconies, comfy beds, great location. But it was far from great for us, and I'd say, until it's cleaned and refurbed and some of the money the owner is making is ploughed back into the property, you'd be better off booking elsewhere."},{"_id":"219557553","date":{"$date":"2017-12-17T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1979960","reviewer_id":"50931834","reviewer_name":"Katie","comments":"Excellent location, lovely spacious rooms.

Here are my comments below on the apartment and the host. \n\nThe apartment: The apartment was located at a very convenient location, close to groceries and transit. The first thing I noticed about the apartment was how accurate the pictures were. When booking online airbnbs, there can sometimes be a discrepancy between what is advertised and what apartment you walk into. However, Eli's apartment was absolutely true to the quality of the pictures; simply spacious, clean and beautiful. While I stayed at the apartment for less than a week, the place was also equipped with almost everything I could think of. The apartment had various kitchen utensils, first aid kit, fresh towels, and an iron to iron your clothes. \n\nThe host: Eli was very attentive and communicative both before and during my stay. He contacted me in advance to confirm when my flight would land. When my flight was delayed, he checked in with me to make sure that I was okay. I felt that he was a caring host, and a well-mannered person in general."},{"_id":"183236850","date":{"$date":"2017-08-16T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19815841","reviewer_id":"40637768","reviewer_name":"Samantha","comments":"While, the location and the place was overall good we did have communication issues.

The location is really great, super close to grand central, pretty quiet for Manhattan, and comfortable. We have used airbnb a lot, and have come to expect things to run smoothly, and they did. Eli was easy to communicate with, she was prompt and always easy to get a hold of when we needed something. She checked in with us half way through just to be sure things were good. And she was willing to fix anything if asked. Airbnb lists the location of the apartment incorrectly, making check in a little confusing, and for some reason I did not get Eli's messages with specific info on how to get in (although I am sure she sent them, my email is sometimes tricky that way). The tv wasn't working, but we never needed or wanted it. Eli offered to have it fixed while we were at the apartment, but we declined. But you might want to check with her ahead of time if tv is important to your stay. The beds were more like doubles than queen sized beds, but the apartment was airy and the bedding was comfortable."},{"_id":"190967162","date":{"$date":"2017-09-05T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19815841","reviewer_id":"85397603","reviewer_name":"Nathan","comments":"Overall, is a extremely please with it stay at Eli's place!

We arrived earlier than expected and were able to leave our suitcases in the room while it was being cleaned. The cleaning lady was very kind! Unfortunately, the check-out instructions (take out trash, etc.) were not communicated to us until after we had already left for the airport. \nThe space was extremely modern and well decorated. The pictures listed were very accurate. Furniture was not of high quality (didn't bother us). We did have some issues with the curtain rods (not secured so they fell when attempting to open the curtains). The TV did not work but that was expected based on other reviews guests had left. The only major issue we encountered was coming back to the balcony window wide open (which we had not touched).

The building was built in 1910, so with that you have the noises that come with a 100+ year old building. But, the interior is updated modernly and feels clean and stylish. The walk to Times Square is 20-30 minutes, so if you're not used to walking to get places, be prepared. The place is on the 3rd floor and there are no elevators, so if you can't climb stairs, this isn't the place for you. The air conditioner is very loud, so bring ear plugs to sleep with if you don't want to hear the noise, but it's also very cold. There are lots of neat little shops and restaurants in the area, so you will definitely have everything you need within a block or two. Overall, we felt very safe and secure, and despite the longer than expected walk to Times Square, the location was great and we'd stay here again.

Only things were the curtains kept falling so maybe make the rods stronger and the no elevator thing was a huge bummer especially bc we had heavy luggage. The sofa bed was incredibly uncomfortable, my friends said they woke up super stiff and hurting but the other beds were good! The bathroom was super clean but at check out my friend was using the bathroom, it was around 10:50 and housekeeping was already banging on the door reminding her check out was at 11. She politely said she was just using the bathroom but she said the housekeeper made her feel super rushed. I also pointed out the nails that was coming out of the wall so we were nervous that if we put anything on that particular shelf it was going to come crashing down. But the central air worked AMAZING , it was freezing in the apartment which was good because it was so hot that day. I know this accommodates 6 and we did fit well, however, it would be best for 4 people and maybe a 5th on the air mattress because the sofa bed was soooo uncomfortable. But overall, we loved it !!!

Prima che si riuscisse a rintracciare l'host e questa rintracciasse gli occupanti perchè si trasferissero ad altro appartamento è passata più di un'ora e capite bene che, dopo 9 ore di volo, il trasferimento dall'areoporto, il fuso orario, la stanchezza, avremmo preferito evitare anche questa seccatura. Oltretutto abbiamo avuto a disposizione un appartamento che, da occupato, non poteva considerarsi pulito e senza considerare che i precedenti occupanti, persone sulle quali non abbiamo dubbi sulla loro integrità, erano comunque in possesso del codice per entrare in quello che era il nostro appartamento. Ci aspettavamo anche la presenza fisica dell'host che, per correttezza, avrebbe dovuto darci migliori spiegazioni sull'accaduto, scusandosi, cosa che non è avvenuta.   L'unico successivo contatto è stato quello di raccomandarci di lasciare l'appartamento per il check-out entro le ore 11 perchè a quell'ora sarebbe arrivato l'addetto delle pulizie; peccato che la stessa precisione non l'abbiamo riscontrata per il check-in.\nPer quanto riguarda l'appartamento risulta più piccolo rispetto a quanto si intuisca dall'inserzione. I posti letto poi, descritti per 7 persone, sono da leggere come per 4 adulti e tre bambini: passi per i due letti matrimoniali (da una piazza e mezza cadauno), ma il divano letto è più piccolo del letto matuimoniale ed il gonfiabile è.....un gonfiabile. Proprio non ce li vedo due adulti dormire nel divano letto!  Il locale poi, come detto, è piccolo e considerato anche le valigie che non hanno spazio per essere ricoverate, ci si ritrova in una situazione davvero angusta. Anche alla luce di questo il prezzo risulta un pò caro.\nSpero di tornare a New York, sicuramente cercherò un altro alloggio"},{"_id":"357193445","date":{"$date":"2018-12-09T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19815841","reviewer_id":"50375544","reviewer_name":"Sandra","comments":"Spacious apartment was perfect for our weekend in city!

Great pizza, fresh salad bar, the most delicious bakery (where most days everything’s $2), fresh fruit, veggies and groceries and wonderful espresso coffee literally across the way. Also, a fantastic laundry across the road and my wife loved the hairdresser two short blocks away and the nail bars and beauticians in abundance on Second.\n\nGrand Central Station is an easy 10 minute walk away and Broadway, Times Square, the museums, galleries, shops and restaurants a pleasant 20 minute stroll.

The bed was comfortable, it was great to have my own bathroom with shower/tub, and she even gave me a shelf in the fridge for my things! I enjoyed using the indoor hot tub and pool in the building as well.

We did not feel like intruders but like visitors who were welcomed. The place was close to the subway which we easily learned to use with the help of \"City Mapper\" a subway app in the play store of our android phone. We could travel most any place in Manhatten within 30 minutes which we did daily. Some of the sites traveled to by subway were top of the rock, times square, pier 83 circle line cruises, Museum of Natural Science, and 911 museum. Furthermore, we were able to park in the street near the building and our vehicle was safe.

As far as parking...there is free street parking on Crown Street and other side streets. And paid hourly parking pretty much everywhere else. Please pay attention to the parking signs though as they can be tricky to understand for people new to New York City. Alternate side parking regualtions for street cleaning apply pretty much everywhere.

AirBnB had dates available and the place was actually unavailable.

I made numerous attempts to contact Nina but nothing. I received the check in instructions and it wasn’t until I sent my 6th message saying I was outside freezing and trying to locate keys that someone responded. I ended up having to book last minute another place but lost $250 tickets to a broadway show I was planning to see for months trying to figure out where I was going to stay. The really irritating part was that all someone had to do wax let me know the pace wasn’t available and I would have made another reservation, but the time to do that is not when I am supposed to arrive. Communication. Is. Key. Also, I didn’t stay here so I don’t know the state of the interior but the check-in process was the worst part of the New York trip."}]}

The best is that Sahar is a great, friendly, communicative host, and it was funny that every time I'd leave I'd get side tracked with great twenty minute conversations with Sahar and other people that are around.

The place is a smaller than it looks on the photos and the washing machine doesn't work which was a little bit of a hassle. There is storage space under the bed and a small table. The room has a small entrance room before you enter where you can put your shoes and which you share with two other apartments. (The photos shown are a mix of all three rooms which are similar).

(my posted rates INCLUDE Maui's 14.41% tax rate!)\r\nWhen I come to Kihei I absolutely LOVE spending time outdoors snorkeling, hiking and just enjoying ALL the beauty of the island.  I chose KGE(Kihei Garden Estates) based on it's location and how easy it is to access all the sights of Maui!  We have a very relaxed and non-commercial complex for our guests enjoyment.  I am very proud of my \"home away from home\" and LOVE sharing it with my guests!!!  Life is a vapor of smoke!

We appreciated the location, next door to a nice grocery store and a short residential black away from a shallow and sheltered beach. While the condo itself is older, the kitchen, floors, and bathroom have both been updated. The kitchen is fully equipped. The lanai area is semi-private, but the neighbors are very close. It's a non-smoking association, but they do provide a smoking area (it's in the parking lot or you can go off property). The nice thing about that is that you don't have smoke coming into your space. That's especially nice because we had the doors and windows open the whole time we were there. The grounds are groomed and immaculate. I wish that I could tell you about the pool and hot tub, but with the beach so close we never had an occasion to make use of them. Kihei itself has some fun shopping (great quilt shop, Coconut's, craft fair) and plenty of grocery stores to choose from. Sandi also provided beach chairs, a couple of boogie boards, and two beach towels. Since we were there for ten days it was nice to have a second set of bath towels. The washer and dryer were just outside the condo and reasonably priced. We would definitely stay at Sandi's condo again."},{"_id":"251356591","date":{"$date":"2018-04-07T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19845395","reviewer_id":"111185250","reviewer_name":"Rich","comments":"Great area, great value, great host.

Sandi was very helpful before I booked, answering questions about how her place would be for my disabled son.  (It was great for him.) The place itself was AWESOME -- very high-end kitchen and bathroom finishes. The complex was well-kept, quiet, and we met some incredible people nightly at the pool. The reason I gave it a four instead of a five was because nothing is perfect.  In this case, there were 2 TVs and a DVD player, but only 12 basic channels and 2 old Meryl Street movies in a cabinet.  Bring your own DVDs, or a ROKU, and you'll be set!  Second, a yard or so from the back patio was a 6 foot high Bougainvillea that separated the unit from a somewhat noisy street.  Combined with the patio above and the overhang in front, the unit was a bit dark and didn't have any view at all.  At this price point I found you get either a small ocean view with a crappy interior, or a nice interior without a view, but not both.  So just decide what is most important to you personally.

It helps to pull the curtains a bit going out for the day so it doesn’t get too hot. There is a great cafe with friendly staff, and good coffee and food in the courtyard below.  It’s called Springtime. There is a bus-stop to shoot into town in about 7 minutes almost directly across the road. Lots of restaurants nearby including a very colourful Mexican one. \nThe directions  to get in if   you are driving, need to be clearer. And it helps to know that it is on level 11  and that the attachment on the key needs to be held near a small box to make the lift go to your level. \nAll in all a magnificent and thoroughly enjoyable stay, and really comfortable beds.

What makes this area unique is the original architecture and the influence of a vastly diverse array of ethnicities who call this middle-class family neighborhood their home.  To the non-New Yorker exploring Brooklyn may seem like navigating a foreign country, but I encourage everyone to explore with an open mind as there is much more than meets the eye! The area is very safe both day and night and has a  neighborhood feel. Our street is lined with small restaurants and bodega's offering the best in no-frills culturally diverse cuisine. I would dare say that this area of Flatbush is a diamond in the rough to those who truly want a real and amazing Brooklyn experience!  You will find shopping markets for basic essentials right down the block along with a laundry mat only a few blocks away. The area is also very quiet aside from the sound of vehicles, which is almost unavoidable anywhere you travel in the five boroughs.

She stayed with me during me move, making sure I was going to be okay.  She stayed in contact with me for the next few days for support and assistance. Over the next few weeks we would text or call each other to catch up. \n\nSherry and I never met prior to this situation; however, she and I have now become friends and I intend to stay in close contact with her. \n\nShe is a wonderful person who is caring and definitely goes above and beyond.

I stayed in the 3br apt with my 2 nieces. It was spacious and I think you would lke it. But, it could be more comfortable for the next guests. \n More attention to cleaning in between the guests, the sofa just needs to be replaced and that odor from the kitchen. It was around the fridge area. She changed the shower curtain and lining so you are ok there.  Drainage in the shower, she can correct that also. Was not with me but for the next guest,  hopefully. The smell from the ac units, I thinks it needs to be cleaned or filters cleaned. I never used one but it should still require maintenance. Unfortunately,  the tv service is horrible. If you want to relax and watch the tube, well good luck. That svc I Hated. Luckily,  I didn't care for that on my trip but it would have been nice when I came in at night.\n So, for the next guest your stay should be on point for comfort. \n We are paying for comfort and we should get it.

It's fairly close to the Subway, which will take you to other locations in Brooklyn or into Manhattan.  This is a good spot if you have a larger group and are budget conscious.  I'd say it is best for group of 6 or fewer.  For more than 6, you will need an air mattress, which is fine but makes the space very tight.\n\nWhen we stayed (late August 2018), two of the four burners on the stove, and the oven, were not working.  We worked around it, but you should be prepared.  Also, the television is tricky to figure out.  Sherry offered help, but by then we had figured it out.  It's a Roku TV but you can't actually watch Roku on it.  You have to watch TV through an app on the TV, and there are limited channels.  \n\nTwo of the bedrooms face the street and can be very loud.  We had the A/C running and a noise machine as well, and I still woke up from the street noise.\n\nFinally, this is probably not the best place if you have small children.  The sofa is broken and propped up on blocks, so if your kids are rowdy you might find yourself reconstructing the sofa...  I doubt you would have any reason to know about this if it's a group of adults staying."},{"_id":"325435857","date":{"$date":"2018-09-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19847790","reviewer_id":"203487394","reviewer_name":"Sean","comments":"Stayed for a week and had a wonderful time!"},{"_id":"328213353","date":{"$date":"2018-09-25T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19847790","reviewer_id":"5252486","reviewer_name":"Nancy","comments":"The area felt safe and secure enough.

The area is not the greatest but that didn't take away from the overall comfort of our stay. The place was clean and the beds were very comfortable for sleeping. 2 of the bedrooms face the street so expect to hear some traffic noise but nothing too extreme, was able to sleep fine. Parking can be tricky but we were able to secure a spot right in front of the property. But be aware of the parking restrictions, on the day we were checking out I look out the window to find our car was the only one parked on that side of the street. Had to drive around for a bit to find another parking but not too far.

Check-in was easy. If you're renting a car, note that street parking can be difficult especially at night and all car have to be moved from 7am-10am. So if you plan to sleep in, dont forget to move the car or prepare for a parking ticket. It is really easy to get to Manhattan as you can take the main street (Flatbush Ave) all the way into lower Manhattan in about 20 mins. If you plan on cooking, be sure to ask if the stove and oven are working as the check in email I received didn't say they will be out if order during my stay. The building is older so some parts of the floor is uneven. It rained really hard one night and created a small leak in the skylight.

She was very flexible and let us check in early on Friday morning, and was available throughout our stay to answer questions. \nWe fit everyone comfortably in the space, and only really had a small issue with the oven when we first turned it on - noticing that a piece of the insulating tubing was loose and it smelled like gas for a moment. \nOverall, this place was well worth what we paid and Sherry's hospitality was unparalleled.

I'll start with the location.  I am from Oahu and did not want to be in the hustle and bustle of downtown.  Kaneohe is a great spot for Koolau Mountain views while being within a short driving distance from town and the north shore.  The neighborhood is very close to the mall and other shopping/restaurant venues.  When you walk out of the duplex, you can see the mountains and water!  Neal was great to work with.  He was always in touch and even provided a couple updates for things to do (i.e. one day the waves on the north shore were high and he recommended we visit).  He went as far as buying a new pack n' play for us when he noticed it wasn't in perfect condition.  I really appreciated that.  The home is newly renovated and came with many perks I haven't seen in other rentals.  The fridge had water and local juice and chocolate covered macadamia nuts were sitting next to the coffee maker.  The beds were extremely comfortable and we had everything we needed to thoroughly enjoy our stay.  My expectatations were surpassed.  Would definitely recommend this rental to anyone looking to stay on Oahu."},{"_id":"209982811","date":{"$date":"2017-11-06T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19877430","reviewer_id":"55012505","reviewer_name":"Christina","comments":"The communication with Neal was amazing.

The place was nicely decorated and very homely. We had a total of eight girls who stayed and we were all able to sleep and move around comfortably. The kitchen had a good supply of dishes and utensils to cook our thanksgiving dinner and we were all grateful to have a kitchen as college students, let alone a cute and well-stocked one. The owner of the home was so generous by providing personal hygiene items in the bathroom like shampoo, conditioner, toothpaste, and a few other goodies. The location was ideal because it wasn’t very far from a bus stop or the closest beach. The only downside was that it was near a chicken coop which could get loud, but our campus, BYUH, has chickens roaming around all the time so we weren’t too bothered. I accidentally left my laptop at the house before we all checked out and the owner was kind enough to take time out of his day to meet me at a grocery store a couple days later and return it to me with no fee of any sort. This inconvenience for him really showed me how much of a kind and considerate guy he was and I’m so glad that my friends and I got to experience our first thanksgiving away from home in such a nice guy’s house. If you’re considering staying here, I highly recommend it because of how flexible and considerate the owner is in making your stay the best it could possibly be. He even gave my friends and I a student discount because he understood how difficult it can be to save money as a college student. Again, highly recommend!!"},{"_id":"215439737","date":{"$date":"2017-11-29T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19877430","reviewer_id":"159224309","reviewer_name":"Wesley","comments":"The place and location were amazing wish it was available longer.

The day of arrival, entering the Airbnb was easy with the instructions he gave us. The kitchen already had some basic groceries that were ours to use.

I mean not only did he leave drinks in the fridge, little local Hawaiian snacks on the side, a super clean and cozy place, suntan lotion for the Hawaii sun, he also was considerate enough to leave Aloe Vera for the sun burn.

There is a local botanical garden, but I suppose the whole island is a botanical wonderland. The home is overlooking the bay and is located in a generally quiet neighborhood (ocassional barking dogs and crowing rosters) . Great for a getaway for friends or families.

It was the perfect size for our family of 3. We loved that it was in a very centrally located town. Quick to get to other parts of the island.  We also appreciated being in the upper part of the duplex. Once a family with much younger kids came to stay in the lower level the sound definitely travelled a lot. But for a large group traveling together it would be perfect to rent both spaces in this house. \n\nNeal was attentive to messages both before our trip and while we were there. We didn’t need to ask for any assistance but I’m confident he would have replied quickly. \n\nNeal provides several very nice amenities. A couple of our favorites were the cooler and stand fans. \n\nThis house is very much in an established neighborhood. The neighborhood wasn’t really our favorite, as we like a bit more space and privacy. As anywhere on the island you’ll hear roosters all night long. The neighbor also has a dog that was kept out all the time. You can see the ocean and mountains, but you are looking over the crowded neighborhood to do so."},{"_id":"341034298","date":{"$date":"2018-10-25T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19877430","reviewer_id":"218134667","reviewer_name":"Jeff","comments":"We loved Neals home.

Will 100% stay here again if we come back to the area. It was in a perfect location to go south to Waikiki for most of our dinner reservations and for various hikes, and then we spend an entire day up in the North Shore area, so it was pretty centrally located to whatever we wanted to do.

She was very responsive and caring. We visited over the Holidays.  Everything worked well, wifi, TV, stove, heat etc. and was easy to adapt to.  We loved the neighborhood and the street is quiet and tree lined.  The living room was simply and beautifully decorated for the Holidays which we really appreciated.\n\nJust two smallish complaints:\n*Morning coffee: (we were 3 and definitely need that one cup on cold winter mornings).  There was only a Nespresso machine (yay!) but no capsules.  We checked in afternoon of Dec. 24th so no way to even buy capsules till the 26th.  We made due by buying coffee for a few days at a dinner and saving it in the frig to reheat.  Also, I drank my coffee out of a child's plastic mug since there were only dainty teacups in the house, and very few at that.  \n*Shampoo etc: There was sufficient gel soap in the master bath (no bar soap) but only baby shampoos etc in the second bedroom.  The person sleeping there felt bad using up what little was left so we just shared back and forth every day.  A little inconvenient.  For such an elegant place one expects the small amenities to be standard in each bath.\nBottom line it's a great location and a stylish, comfortable home.  Just remember that the owner is French and the accommodations are in a European style."}]}

As we arrived in HK in typhoon season, he constantly messaged us to check up if we're okay- if we're trapped in the heavy rain, which is honestly so sweet of him!

Located in the central part of the city, it is walking distance to the Kowloon station (airport express) and two other metro stations. Being central, a variety of supermarkets, eating joints are in the vicinity; the night market and Nathan road are just a few minutes away. The apartment is quite modern, good for two people (three becomes a crowd, unless it is a small child). It consists of a living room with a sofa cum bed, a bedroom and a bath-cum-toilet, all compact. The access is through electronic key, so there were no issues of handing over keys at time of check-in/out. The wifi in this place is quite good. The presence of kettle, hot plate, OTG, fridge, along with the necessary utensils gives flexibility. The apartment has only one window in the bedroom (other than bathroom); with other tall buildings in the vicinity, there is no great view of the outside - just the street and the next building. \nThe host was great in terms of responsiveness, be it any problem in the apartment (hardly any), tips on where to eat, visit, etc. \nHad a great time visiting HK and this apartment added to it.

We dropped off my bags and then he walked me halfway to the ferry terminal to the mainland, which is where I was going next. You wouldn't get that level of service with most hotels.\nAlthough there's quite a lot of construction going on in this bit of Kowloon, and it's a busy area, the place is modern and the apartment is scrupulously clean. I really liked the modern keypad entry system with digits that flash on and off, so futuristic compared with my bunch of keys back home.\nThe apartment is small but for a solo traveller it's ideal. There's aircon in the bedroom and also in the living room/kitchen, and a fridge too. The bathroom is small but the space is used effectively. The whole place is covered in clean monochrome grey tiles, including the walls. There's some nice touches like jasmine tea and some snacks.\nAs I did say, it's a busy area so you can hear traffic noise (especially the beeping of the pedestrian crossing) but I slept soundly with earplugs. You can also hear pigeons but they're on the outside so that's not a problem!\nThe one thing that I will remember was the fire alert (on my first day). I had left the apartment and came back a few hours later to find the area sealed off with police tape and firemen with water hoses everywhere. Not sure where it was, but thankfully we were back inside an hour or so later and everything was fine!"},{"_id":"246718433","date":{"$date":"2018-03-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19906012","reviewer_id":"26053332","reviewer_name":"Lee","comments":"Descriptions written in the listing are all accurate and genuine.

This one bedroom unit has quite a spacious living room, a toilet and bath and a bedroom that nicely fits a queen-sized bed. All amenities are readily available so it is very convenient. The Austin MTR station is within 5 minutes walk away and the Jordan station is about 10 minutes away. We were a family consisting of a couple, an infant and an elderly who just underwent hip replacement surgery and the location allows us easy access to places we wanted to visit.

Location\nThe place is located in a central area (Hell's Kitchen), yet it will not be as chaotic and noisy than if you stayed at a hotel in Times Square. It's just two blocks away from the theater district and Times Square. Plenty of food options (just a block away from Gotham Market). And if you need to get anywhere, the subway stop is two blocks away too. The neighborhood is safe, even if you come back late at night/early in the morning. I never felt unsafe.\n\n2. Apartment\nThe apartment is a modern, minimalistic look, so it is not one of those historical NY apartments. It is much sleeker than even hotels I've stayed, even the lobby. You are granted one key access, both for the building and the apartment. The photos are 100% accurate on what you will expect.\n\n3. Bedroom \nThe bedroom is pretty small, because the bed is large. But you get a walk-in closet to put your luggage and clothes! There is plenty of sunlight seeping in as well. \n\n4. Host\nThe host is excellent! She responds very quickly and is able to accommodate you with almost everything. She even serves breakfast!\n\nWhether you're traveling alone (like me) or with a family, you will not be disappointed in staying here."},{"_id":"197752708","date":{"$date":"2017-09-26T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19914589","reviewer_id":"146685830","reviewer_name":"Tal","comments":"The house was well decorated, in a good location.\nBrandy is very nice.\nIt's recommended if you look for a room and not the whole apartment to yourself."},{"_id":"198803552","date":{"$date":"2017-09-30T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19914589","reviewer_id":"105375528","reviewer_name":"Janice","comments":"Our stay here was wonderful!

We unfortunately had to ask her about replacing garbage bags and cleaning stains on the kitchen counter among others.\n*In the ad as well, it is mentioned that the place has a large living room area, but what you actually see on the photo is the actual area. It's not large and just enough for a couple of people\n*I gave her a heads up that we were going to be four people staying and asked if that was okay and if she had extra mattresses. In one of her messages, she specifically mentioned that she had 1 queen bed and 2 \"high quality\" floor mattresses. The queen bed was perfect when we got there, but we had no \"high quality\" mattresses. One of us had to sleep in two comforters put together on the floor for about 9 nights. The other slept in a foldable mattress, clearly not the \"high quality\" type. But it did its job.\n\nOverall we think it's still worth it staying in her place. We just think she probably needs to either change her ad about certain things or make necessary changes with the \"mattresses\" she has. And also we think it would help if she will buys a new trashcan in the bathroom as it is broken. :)"},{"_id":"219464842","date":{"$date":"2017-12-17T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19914589","reviewer_id":"76790880","reviewer_name":"Benjamin","comments":"Enjoyed our stay.

I really appreciate how Feliz allowed me to check in early and was accommodating with my schedule.  The only tidbit we had was the Internet service not working (which sucked since we couldn't get much signal with our phones as we're surrounded by brick) and some used dishes in the sink. \nWe didn't mind the dishes since we had no use for the kitchen, and it could be in part that we checked in at an earlier time than intended.

Unfortunately this wasn’t our best stay in NYC.. even though Feliz is a genuinely nice person, she makes you feel like a guest in her own place, while we paid a consistent amount of money for renting out the room. This happens when the host is living in the flat she is renting. Also, she complained about our going in and out with luggages, though we were on a business trip and no options - we had to carry our work in an out for meetings in the city. The flat was sufficiently clean, a part from the bathroom that after two days of several people taking a shower was quite dirty. And it remained dirty until we left. Last but not least, there were way too many rules to follow (don’t use the main entrance, don’t talk to people, don’t use the kitchen, etc.). We felt like in a Boot Camp! So, if you want a relaxing time and you wanna feel good at home, don’t book this place."},{"_id":"270041804","date":{"$date":"2018-05-28T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19914589","reviewer_id":"12281595","reviewer_name":"Claudia","comments":"Unfortunately we missed fresh towels, bed sheets and toiletpaper when we first arrived.

Wir haben uns in der Wohnung und Nachbarschaft wohl gefühlt. Der nahe gelegene Supermarkt mit Kaffee-Ecke ist ideal und die Nachbarschaft ist sehr sicher. Wir haben uns nie unwohl oder unsicher gefühlt. Die Wohnung an sich war sehr modern und schön, leider war das Badezimmer jedoch stark verschmutzt. Sowohl die Dusche, als auch die Toilette waren sehr dreckig und für jemanden, der es sehr gerne sauber hat, nicht ideal. Die Toilette war unter dem Deckel voll von Kot und in der Dusche waren viele schwarze Stellen ersichtlich. Die restliche Wohnung war sauber. Leider hat uns Feliz erst 24 Stunden vor unserer Anreise mitgeteilt, dass sie gezügelt hat und die Wohnung neu an einem anderen Ort liegt. Das ist viel zu spät, so konnten wir in kürze auch keine Alternative mehr suchen. Die neue Wohnung war zwar im selben viertel, jedoch immerhin 15 Minuten zu Fuss vom gebuchten Standort entfernt. Die Wohnung ist sicher für Einzelpersonen oder Paare geeignet und man hat nur 10 Minuten Fussweg zu einer grösseren U-Bahn-Station und 10 Minuten Fussweg zum Central Park.

Smooth conversation before my trip, easy key handover and explanations about the Apartment. The Apartment is neat and clean. However it is indeed small (just as noted in their description), probably not the best to stay if you are above 1.90m tall. And dont underestimate the 4 floor walk-up in this small staircase. Especially if its very hot outside, this makes you sweat even more. \n\nOverall Id recommend it for a shorter stay, as the Location is really convenient and Natalia is a nice host.

The living room was clean and quite spacious with a TV, couch, ceiling fan and balcony overlooking the skyscrapers and bay. There is an A/C in the bedroom and it made sleeping much more comfortable in mid-August's temperature. I was also glad there were plenty of water bottles in the refrigerator and bath/shower amenities that were provided for us.

Comfy bed and super clean place.  A nice couch to relax on at the end of the day and a fridge and kitchen to help us plan snacks for our road trips really was great.  This is not the most modern building, but for the value who cares?  We had a small car that worked well with the parking spot available, and everything in the unit made me feel like I was in my own apartment off the beach instead of some cold crappy hotel room with no kitchen.  The kitchen came with all the plates and utensils, some coffee, spices, heck even a small bag of rice and some drinks in the fridge.  If you want a great experience for a good price this is it.  If you want the spend twice as much, pay for parking, and have no kitchen, stay at the hotels along the beach.  I'd come back to this unit any time."},{"_id":"234185534","date":{"$date":"2018-02-11T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19935458","reviewer_id":"8963191","reviewer_name":"CathyNJayne","comments":"Let me first state....this location is perfect!  We were there for a full month.  You can walk to beach with ease every day and night.  Shops, dining, transit...all in easy walking distance.  The only problem is the street noise in front, and other apartment and grounds keeping noise in back (bedroom).  We used ear plugs...you will need them if windows and lanai doors are open.  We got used to the earplugs and the noise.  There is a parking space which is a plus...but do be sure to secure an economy (Website hidden by Airbnb) is a very, very small garage with a small space.  Take care with parking.  The unit is old...but the location more than makes up for any shortcomings.  There is fireworks to enjoy every Friday nite at 7:45 (times may change as you head to longer days).  We watched from several locations...best viewing is across the street at the Hilton Hawaiian village man made pond area....wonderful.   \n\nAs for the unit specific challenges...we reported to property managers that we immediately replaced the shower curtain liner due to a good deal of mold.  This is a highly humid (Website hidden by Airbnb) mold is to be expected.  But it should have been handled prior to our check in.  They offered to take care of it, but since we needed showers upon arrival, we immediately replaced.   The hot water faucet in tub needs repair as it leaked water with a steady stream shooting onto the floor.  PM was ready to have repaired but We fixed by wrapping a washcloth around it to capture/divert water.  It would probably take a plumber, and we did not want to be inconvenienced with the (Website hidden by Airbnb) we kept our remedy in place and informed PM to fix upon our departure.  \nAll in all...we loved our stay.  The place gets a great cross breeze ( trade winds) and is close to everything.

I was going for a cheaper place and I definitely payed for it. This is located about 1/2-1mile from the beach, and does NOT have a fireworks view. \nI read the details and messed up when I was offered a rental car upgrade to a Jeep (my bad). This did not fit in the lower parking. I called Maxine and she was very prompt but definitely annoyed with me, asking if I read the rules. She was able to get me a new spot on the upper level at $15/day.\nUpon walking in the unit, it looked clean from afar. Once I was inside, I noticed sticky residue on the table, and dirt everywhere. The kitchen was not clean, the fridge was disgusting, I had to clean the handle just to open it (we bought groceries before checking in). The bathroom is what really got me. I understand its a humid island but the mold in the bathroom is not acceptable. I lived on a very humid island for the past 3 years, and never had mold like this. A little bleach-water mixture will take care of that real quick. Additionally, there was hair folded into the clean towels. The light switches were filthy as well.\nThe bedroom wasn't too bad. The a/c unit is extremely loud, which was the only reason I could not hear the noise from the street all night. \nOver all, I would not recommend this place to anyone. Stay closer to the beach area, in a cleaner place.

You’re really close to the beach, restaurants in Waikiki and have great views from the 10th floor of the building. The place was very clean when we arrived. The kitchen was well stocked with the essentials needed. We did have an issue with parking please be sure to get a compact car because it’s in a lower garage which clearance is only 5’9’’ — which I saw when booking but didn’t realize how small that was. Originally we planned on a small car but splurged on a Jeep.  So when we pulled up in our Jeep we didn’t fit. Fortunately there was a place available on the upper deck where we could pay another 15$ a night opposed to not having any parking at all. But don’t let this be you! They have fans in the living room and bedroom which help keep the place very cool. However the only AC is a window unit in the bedroom. Which definitely worked well for the bedroom not so much for the living room. We were there in August it wasn’t terrible in the living room with the ceiling fan going but just to add that last piece so there are no surprises!

Nice bonus: roof-top deck with view on the city skyline. Parking on the street, which may or may not be easy to find depending on day and time of day.\nFour people can sleep, with one double bed in the bedroom and a very comfortable IKEA sectional that converts into a queen-size bed in the living room.  There was no coffee maker which should be taken into consideration when planning your trip -- We needed to go out to get our coffee in the morning.

Most importantly, very patient when our estimated time arrival was later than expected (we were driving from NY to Montreal).  The space is accurately described, but during very hot summer days and nights, it gets very little ventilation (windows are small and face a courtyard).  While it says there's no AC, there should be fans provided.  We asked for two fans and were told we could be reimbursed for one fan only. We had two people staying in the back room and one person in the living room - being limited to one fan was not sufficient to provide circulation.  Also, the showerhead was broken and not fixed during our time there.  We did not use the shower the first day or two to avoid spraying the water all over the bathroom (it got the toilet paper wet) - not taking a shower on top of a hot apartment was not ideal.  Finally, the washer had very gross/dirty sheets in there - if we are paying for a cleaning fee, we shouldn't have to see that."},{"_id":"315383704","date":{"$date":"2018-08-28T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19953862","reviewer_id":"82851531","reviewer_name":"Aymeric","comments":"Très bonne adresse, vraiment bien située.

Six of us went up for a night to go to the Canadiens/Bruins game, and everything was in walking distance from the rink to the bars to the entertainment.  Communication was great and check in/check out was very easy.  There is not parking on site, but their is a parking garage about 1 block down the street for around $30 Canadian per day.  My only problem  with the place is that the 13 guest claim is a stretch.  This wasn't a problem for us as we only had 6, but future travelers should be aware of this.  There are 3 bedrooms, each with a queen bed, a futon, and a couch.  By my count (if you put 2 in each bed and the futon and 1 on the couch) that is enough room for 9.  There were some floor mattresses stuffed into the closets, so I guess you could find a spot on the floor for those to get to 13 but that wouldn't be very comfortable.  Also, there were only lines/pillows provided for the 3 bedrooms so make sure to bring your own sleeping bags/pillows.  Two of my friends had to use their luggage as pillows and their coats as blankets.  This being said, I would definitely rent here again.

Plenty of room in the kitchen and bathroom as well. The location is great because it is less than a 10 minute walk to the beach and give or take a few minutes to walk to restaurants. Also easy driving distances to all the west Maui highlights. The pool and grill are steps away and seemed nice, but we did not use either one. Linsay is great to work with.

The unit itself was beautifully decorated in modern, yet warm, decor with excellent bed linens and ample beach and bathroom towels. The home and amenities are exactly as described in the listing. We stayed at another airbnb while on the island and let's just say Sunset Stowaway was a far better choice. Lindsay went above and beyond in comparison to what the other host/unit provided. By that I mean the unit had it all and the photos really don't do it justice. A huge king bed with a GREAT mattress, fully stocked kitchen, plenty of dishes, stone countertops, comfortable beach chairs, umbrellas, a GOOD hard sided cooler, plenty of hangars, toiletries,  books, comfortable patio chairs, ceiling fan, and two floor fans for keeping the unit cool, the list goes on and on.  It really was like a true home away from home in regard to the style of homes we prefer to book at- Clean, fresh, bright, modern etc. \nWe didn't get a chance to use the pool but liked that it was always very quiet there and looked very clean also. The unit was only a small flight of stairs away from the designated parking stall which was also a plus when we had groceries to bring in.

If your mental picture of a Hawaiian vacation requires an ocean view balcony, maid service, and onsite restaurant, you are missing the point of rental websites like this. If your vacation involves bringing kids of the \"need to run around screaming\" variety, look elsewhere-- I don't recall seeing anyone under 25 in this entire real-locals condo complex. If you need loud, you won't find it. The only noise we heard came during the afternoon of Superbowl Sunday, where screams of joy and anguish were sporadically emitted from the screen doors and slatted windows we passed on our walk to the beach. A couple notes about the above: The screen doors are the heavy duty black grid kind, that you leave shut with the main door open. Then you open the door to the lanai (patio), and create a fresh air flow with the fan. This is how you cool down a place without an air conditioner. We were never uncomfortable in the 80s (temperature; not decade). The other thing I wanted to point out is that I said \"walk to the beach\". It's entirely possible to hit sand in 10 minutes from the door, but you can be more leisurely, enjoy a definitely-not-spiked drink you made using supplies from the nearby grocery store that is pretty expensive until you compare making food at the condo to eating out every meal. And then you remember you're on an island. It's a really quick drive to the public parking, but no guarantee that you'll get a spot. We drove a few times when our feet were super tired from other walking excursions, but there was one time when we had to drive home and walk because there wasn't parking. Of course, when we walked through the lot, there were three spaces. You know how it goes. Staying in this condo and walking to the beach provides the most realistic fantasy of what living on Maui could look like for you and your main squeeze. The place has all the kitchen stuff we needed, a cooler to take to the beach, a Smart TV that we watched YouTube on at night (I actually didn't check if there was cable TV or not) but the Wi-Fi worked well and there was enough room at the kitchen bar to set up my laptop to do some work (which I almost did before saying \"F that, I'm on vacation\"). The stand up shower had good water pressure and got hot water fast, which is really all I ever want, though it also happens to be one of the more creative remodels I've seen. If you've ever looked at Pinterest for remodel ideas, I don't think you're alone-- this place feels new, very comfortable and full of good vibes. The bed was comfortable. If I had to come up with a downside, it's that at night it could be a little bright from the lights outside the other buildings since we slept..."},{"_id":"235738622","date":{"$date":"2018-02-17T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"19981253","reviewer_id":"148628652","reviewer_name":"Cary","comments":"Exactly as described.

The host also does an amazing job walking you through the entire check in process and provides very prompt responses. \nTwo things I'd like to point out, there is no air conditioning. If you're not used to 70-80 degree humid nights I would be wary of booking. However, there is a very adequate ceiling fan and two oscillating floor fans. Also, during the time of our stay, the screen door was unable to lock so we couldn't sleep with the glass door open for some air. \nOverall, I would highly recommend simply due to how helpful and cordial the host was.

George made an effort to make sure the house was aired and cool. When we arrived George had turned on misting fans/normal fans in each bedroom and had turned on air conditioning in the main area. There was also nice music playing in one of the living areas. The linen was clean and fresh and plenty of towels were provided. There was an ashtray and bench seat in the backyard provided for smokers as well as a pleasant outdoor alfresco area. George had coke, water, beer and noodles stocked in the cupboards and fridge with a piggy bank system where you left money for what you had taken. We were very pleased with this and brought some coke as we hadn’t packed any drinks with us for our travels. Another thing I was impressed with was the quality hand washes/body washes and shampoo and conditioner that George had generously provided. This property is great for families with children as there was a cot provide in one of the rooms if you should have need of it. We were all very pleased with this property and will be staying here again if we need to stay in the area again. Thanks George for making sure we had an enjoyable and pleasant place to stay in.

Again he visited us at 10pm plus to discuss with us of his friend (travel agent) day tour packages for us! \n\nGeorge always very thoughtful towards our stay! He even offered to send our luggages to the train station when we left the place! \n\nAll 13 of us rated his place 5 stars not only for our stay but also because of his warm hospitality!

The photos didn't do the house justice since it's far more spacious in real life. It's perfect for big groups and family. The Macquarie Fields train station isn't that far away and it goes straight to Central Station and Opera House! George was extremely responsive including in the middle of the night. Ask for anything, he will make sure your request will be granted as soon as he could. If there's any improvement I could recommend is only the entrance. George, that huge tree in front of the house got to go mate. Anything else was PERFECT! Thank you so much George. You are awesome!
