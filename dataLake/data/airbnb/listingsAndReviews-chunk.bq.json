The Ohana is very nicely decorated, plenty spacious for two, and feels very private. Garden and grounds are beautiful and rustic. Hunt around and you might find a Chameleon or two in the bushes!

I had wanted to find a place in Waimea that would give me privacy, lots of light and air, and a feeling of a home vs a hotel.  The Green Flash House met all those wishes and more!  My hostess, Jeanie, also contributed to my positive experience.  Jeanie is warm, friendly, and helpful.  She respected my privacy at all times.  She seemed to have a knack of appearing in her backyard just when I wanted to talk with her but seemed invisible the rest of the time.  She should know I would always welcome the chance to speak to such a rare, spiritual, nice, and entertaining person.\r\n\r\nI highly recommend this house for one or two guests.  I do not recommend this place if you have children.

We will definitely return. Genie also welcome to us with a delicious loaf of sourdough bread,  coffee beans and a big basket of fruit. Can't wait to return."},{"_id":"189155285","date":{"$date":"2017-09-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"318028","reviewer_id":"118240352","reviewer_name":"Leslie","comments":"My son and I arrived and were warmly greeted by Jean.

Jean thoughtfully supplied the small kitchenette with snacks and coffee which we were grateful for after our long flight. The place is simple and cosy, and stocked with all the things you might need to make yourself at home: grocery bags, a mini-library of local history, nature and folklore, and lovely garden views from the little dining table. While the traffic on the road was a bit loud in the mornings, it was worth it for us to be so well located near shops, great restaurants, a quick drive to excellent beaches, and close to my friend's town. Waimea is a great little village.\nJean was communicative and kind.

I was pleasantly surprised by the size of the space when I arrived, I was expecting it to be smaller. Bed was very comfy for one person, not sure it would be for two people though. There are thoughtful touches, and also lots of brochures and books about the island. The road is closer to the house than I thought, so you can hear the traffic, but hey it's Hawaii... so it's not bad, and it's quiet at night.\nI liked to be in Waimea, I think it's well situated if like me you like to drive around a lot (I did all the main roads of the island in one week, it was awesome). It's the country and it's beautiful! And there are gorgeous beaches only a short 30 minutes drive away. The town has a few great places to eat (great ramen at noodle club).\nJean was very prompt to respond to messages and is super friendly!! Mahalo!!"}]}

Giysi dolanıbının çekmecesindeki lavanta koku torbasına kadar her şey en ince ayrıntısına kadar düşünülmüştü. Ev sahibimiz mutfak ve salona taze nergis çiçekleri koyarak evin kokusunun bile doğal güzellikte olmasına özen göstermişti. Evdeki canlı çiçekleri ve duvarda asılı orijinal olduğunu tahmin ettiğim tabloları çok sevdim. Bir de kahve makinelerini. Türk kahvesi için ve filtre kahve için ayrı ayrı kahve makineleri vardı.

We stayed at her place for 18 days and it was a wonderful experience from day one when Marcia greeted us with a warm aloha hug followed by a very detailed tour of her home. She was great to talk with and full of life and wisdom, and also pointed us to a very delicious Greek restaurant (Olive Tree) nearby for dinner. Her home is immaculately clean with a gorgeous kitchen, has a lovely deck where you can see the luscious mountains and Waikiki twinkling in the distance, is loaded with all of the plates, glassware, silverware, cooking equipment, etc. that you'll ever need (even tupperware!), and is located in a really great neighborhood (Kaimuki/Palolo Valley) in short driving distance to lots of amazing restaurants and not too far from Whole Foods and Kahala Mall. Important notes to consider: 1) The sewage pipes in the house are apparently pretty old, so you will be asked to not flush toilet paper down the toilet, but rather place it in the garbage. It takes some getting used to, but eventually you'll get the hang of it! 2) Her home is located on a VERY steep hill and her parking spot is very difficult to maneuver into, so street parking is highly advised. All in all, we had a very lovely stay with Marcia and look forward to staying in touch!

The photos are an accurate representation of the rooms and overall living environment. I especially loved the bathtub because it was updated, clean, and modern. As others have mentioned, Marcia's place is about a 10 min drive away from Waikiki, and there is a steep hill to climb up to get to the main house (nothing unmanageable or unbearable.) I got to briefly meet Marcia because a personal and emergency situation had come up,  so it was a bummer that I couldn't spend more time getting to know her after reading all the wonderful reviews. But she is a very lovely woman and knows her island.  A designated contact had taken care of my check-in, and he was very responsive and accessible. Overall, a wonderful stay and a great value. Hope to reconnect with Marcia again in the future! \n\nOH YEA -- Marcia introduced to me to a coffee shop near her house. I almost skipped this shop, but SO GLAD I decided to give it a chance on my last day! BEST ICED COFFEE EVER. Make sure you don't miss out!"},{"_id":"280257028","date":{"$date":"2018-06-22T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3200122","reviewer_id":"72173223","reviewer_name":"Krishna","comments":"Marcia made us feel very welcomed in her home.

The room is big enough, you have enough space to put your own stuff. The bed is very comfortable, all the sheets smell so nice, you can sleep like a baby just like sleep at home.\nThe place is in a hill, if you have a car, would be perfect. But even if you cannot drive just like me, you still could take the bus to go anywhere easily, since the bus stop is just 3mins walk from the door.\nMarcia is a super nice lady, she is beautiful, kind, active and intercultural. It's very nice to have conversations with this kind of international person! She is very helpful as well, can give you advice about where to go, what to do, also help you out when you need something, such like a beach towel and etc..\nI very recommend to stay at Marcia's place when you visit Waikiki, you are gonna like the place and her! And I will stay again for sure when I visit next time!\nThanks Marcia, to have me!

It was like someone just slept in it. The bed was very high. My busband, average height for a Chinese, had to climb up.The boy who came with you was sweeping the floor. (what does that tell you?)  Shouldn't cleanliness be done before admitting a tenant? You even threw your shopping bag under the hangers where the clothes were hung.There was only one chair for two people. The tile floor was slippery so was the bathroom floor which was cement. I had to walk gingerly holding on to something for fear of falling. Your shampoo and soap bottles were on the floor. There was no place, a shelf or a ledge, to hold toiletries. When I opened the medicine cabinet to look for shelves and I found them so dirty I had to put toilet paper to line them. I don't think the place was cleaned after the last tenants whom you rented to for a much lower rent, $200 for 3 nights. You left the debris because you did not clean the room. I doubt if you even cleaned the bed sheets and pillow cases for us. Am I not telling all the facts? When you met us you mean you did not know that we are elderly people? The place did not look like what your pictures look at all. Now how can I put all that in my review for the public? The one good point for your place is the location, very convenient. I hope you will fix up your place, rearrange your furniture and cover your bathroom floor before an accident happens. Good luck."},{"_id":"1533939","date":{"$date":"2012-06-22T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"320446","reviewer_id":"1276958","reviewer_name":"Katherine","comments":"his place is at one of the best location in HK.

Since the building has a few steps before the elevator, they'll be sure to help you lug your luggage too.  Very helpful for a single female traveler like myself.  \r\n\r\nThe place is located right on a major road with a ton of transportation options to go anywhere in HK.  It's right in between Causeway and Wanchai (5-10 min walk towards each), which is perfect for shopping and great food, yet far away so you're not in the middle of the chaos all the time.\r\n\r\nThe common area is kept up well, Judy comes every other day to clean I believe.  The other housemates are also respectful of the common area so you won't see any clutter around.  The room itself is spacious for HK standards and has all the basic amenities that you'd need for a single traveler.  Crystal is very accommodating and would try to provide you with what you need if you ask!  Before I moved in, I noticed that there isn't a mirror in the room (other than the bathroom one), and they were able to get me a mirror :)\r\n\r\nMy only gripe about the place is that the Internet can be slow at times because the room is situated farthest from the router.  A usual traveler probably would not notice, but I had to do quite a bit of work during my stay.  \r\n\r\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!\r\n\r\n**edit: Crystal reached out to me afterwards to let me know that there is LAN connection available which would have much faster connection.  This just goes to show how much she cares about her guests that she would respond to me even after the stay :)\r\n\r\n"},{"_id":"3844697","date":{"$date":"2013-03-20T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"320446","reviewer_id":"4796672","reviewer_name":"Rhys","comments":"This was a great stay!

I came across the room in the apartment on airbnb and decided to try it out.  Crystal had her assistant Anna help me move in.  The place is in a fairly convenient location on the border between Causeway Bay and Wanchai, with the closest MTR station being the time square entry/exit, about a 10 minute walk.\r\n\r\nThe room in the apartment is plenty sufficient for just one person.  I was working so I didn't spend too much time in the apartment.  The bed was plenty big and comfortable.  The internet connection was mostly stable.  The TV had a lot of channels to keep you entertained.  Maybe one slight issue on the apartment is the shower/bathroom setup, where there is not separation between the shower and the toilet, so after showering the whole areas take sometime to dry.  It wasn't much of an issue for me since I was mostly out during the day.  The apartment was very well secured, with multiple doors that require key/keycard.  Don't forget the keys, it could be very inconvenient.  You have to contact Crystal and she would promptly let you back in.\r\n\r\nCrystal is a very responsible host, she responded to every request I had, from additional supplies to space heater.  All the items Crystal listed was provided, including simcards and gym membership (monthly renters). She generally responds very promptly.  I recommend this place to stay if you are alone or at most 2 ppl for each room."},{"_id":"29299054","date":{"$date":"2015-04-06T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"320446","reviewer_id":"28485868","reviewer_name":"Madeline","comments":"Very easy to communicate and organise - instant reply to any email and always answers her phone.

We were looking for a place close to Olympic Park and we were within walking distance.  The apartment was clean and had all amenities listed.  The downside was that there was not much in the area as far as restaurants and nightlife.  a small grocery store next door and a pharmacy for basic needs.  Getting from the airport was trying since little is translated to English and I found transportation tough to navigate.  A lot of volume at the airport that Rio just didn't know what to do with due to the Olympics.  Fabio did work to connect me with local services and did provide a nice welcoming at the apartment.  This was very convenient for the Olympics but the open swear system and lack of nightlife would lead me to look else where if I ever return to Rio."},{"_id":"199305132","date":{"$date":"2017-10-01T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"3208863","reviewer_id":"147433632","reviewer_name":"Aline","comments":"O apartamento é novo, o condomínio é bom e fica numa boa localização!
