I'm originally from Brooklyn and was visiting from buffalo with my boyfriend. The home is cozy and perfect for 2 ppl and looks exactly like the photos. We didn't use public transportation  during this trip but the location is great for driving to and  from manhattan only about a 30 minute drive . Corner store and deli were convenient.  The people in front of the building were friendly never bothered us . The building was quiet and the neighborhood was safe we came in pretty late the days we were there. I could be a bit bias being that my family and friends live in Parkslope but I  would definitely recommend her home to everyone ."},{"_id":"170975725","date":{"$date":"2017-07-16T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16971327","reviewer_id":"137247564","reviewer_name":"Jeff","comments":"Solid place, very comfortable and clean"},{"_id":"173563011","date":{"$date":"2017-07-23T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16971327","reviewer_id":"32539323","reviewer_name":"Elizabeth","comments":"Cute, clean, well appointed apartment!"},{"_id":"190521483","date":{"$date":"2017-09-04T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16971327","reviewer_id":"104793035","reviewer_name":"Bridget \u0026 Brian","comments":"Amanda's place was clean, bright \u0026 comfortable.

The bathroom can feel cramped, but hey this is NYC, you have to sacrifice something. The AC's are great after an arduous walk upstairs.

There was everything a traveler would need, including all the utilities needed to cook and clean with, as well as extra towels and bathroom amenities. Our neighbors upstairs were a little noisy (you can hear their footsteps), as they had a small child or perhaps several who would run around in the mornings as well as late in the night. When their doorbell rings, the lights inside the apartment will flash, and an alarm will sound. It is in a basement, but the location is fantastic. There was a nice park across the street, and it was only a few hundred meters from the subway, which will take you into the city in less than a half hour. Unfortunately, we did lose our key, and had to pay the most expensive option to regulate the situation. If this happens to you, purchase a Weiser SmartKey Relocking set at Walmart or Home Depot, a few kilometers away from the apartment for $15 to re-key it yourself, as the lock is a Weiser Smartkey lock, which does not need to be replaced to be re-keyed. With that said, be advised that since there is no security deposit, any potential damages will have to be discussed between you and your host. Other than losing our key and having to replace an entire lock rather than getting a new set of keys, we had a great time in Montreal and enjoyed our stay in Steven's lodging."},{"_id":"169483855","date":{"$date":"2017-07-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16976284","reviewer_id":"94739835","reviewer_name":"Jasper","comments":"Prima kamer op een goede locatie!"},{"_id":"171013193","date":{"$date":"2017-07-16T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16976284","reviewer_id":"24898451","reviewer_name":"Kayla","comments":"A great experience!

This apt. totally ruined our vacation in Montreal. We had just came from another airbnb in Quebec City that was just amazing and above expectations and landed in a dirty, small and noisy airbnb with a host that had no sense of hospitality at all!. The floor was sticky, the dishes were still in the dish washer, the bed was not made and only had 2 pillow covers out of the 4 and they smelled like a sweaty man, there were only 3 small towels that were stained and did not smell fresh and were also located in the kitchen?? There was a nutella pot outside full of cigarettes. You could hear every step and laugh from the neighbors upstairs. Even though this was not unavoidable for the host she should still warn the guests about it. The 2 bar chairs in the pictures were not even there and there were many light bulbs that did not work. So what you saw in the pictures was different in person. There was no closet available to the guest so we had to keep everything in our suitcases which made the apt. even smaller. There was no toaster, water cooker nor a coffee machine. Just essential things!! So we had to literally go out for a cup of coffee. The trash can didn’t even have a bag in it. It was literally walk in clean and tidy up the apt. (That’s not even yours to begin with) before we could actually get some sleep. We left after 3 days in stead of staying our full 6 days and only because there were no other airbnb’s available in such a short notice and we had our 3year old daughter with us. Other wise we would not have minded sleeping in the car, at least the car was clean!. We were only refunded €61 out of the €452 even though we only stayed half of the time!. It honestly felt like a rip off and scam. When we contacted to host about our complaints and that we were leaving earlier she said she was sorry and that she would contact the cleaning company to see were it went wrong and get back at us with a solution. We never heard from her again!."},{"_id":"291168322","date":{"$date":"2018-07-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"16981802","reviewer_id":"78917060","reviewer_name":"Zak","comments":"Upon arriving at this home, all of the garbages were full, and the bedsheets hadn’t been washed. Fortunately, this was the only downside to our experience. We contacted the host and received a prompt response. Under the circumstances, the host was extremely apologetic and dealt with the situation well. It seemed to have been a miscommunication with the designated cleaners. \n\nDespite this, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The pictures are identical to what the place looks like in person. There are several places to eat and shop within walking distance. This place also has a balcony which is quite spacious especially considering the location of the home. Parking is available, however there is one particular day of every week where parking is prohibited from 9:00-11:00 AM. We ended getting a $62.00 ticket because we were unaware. As long as you pay attention to the signs you will be fine. Overall we would certainly recommend staying here, and we plan to book this home again in the future.

В квартире два туалета, что очень удобно, когда путешествуешь с семьей и детьми или большой компанией. Amarjeet замечательный хозяин, отзывчивый и внимательный, очень быстро отвечает на любые вопросы, готов помочь в любой ситуации, если необходимо даже встретить в аэропорту.

And we also took away the famous Kam's Roast Goose to Amarjeet's place and skipped the queue as it's just nearby.\nWalking distance 5 to 10 minutes - Wan Chai MTR, sport retail shops, Wai Chai wet market. The wet market is happening from the morning till night.\nAnd you can reach Causeway Bay by tramway or walking distance 10 to 15 minutes.\nAnd I would give a credit to Amarjeet for his quick responses to an incident. On the 3rd night, the gas was ran out when we were cooking some vegetables, and he got his assistant to help us to change the gas cylinder at the night.

We really enjoyed the space in the apartment, it was great to have a living room to sit in and watch a bit of telly once the children had gone to bed. The apartment is suitable for 4 people, 5 would be ok too. \n\nOur only dislike was the bed in the larger bedroom, it was too hard for our liking and led to a couple of uncomfortable night's sleep.

She was so nice to meet us at an easy location so that we could bus with her to her home and the house we rented on the other side of her lovely yard.  The house is so nice, all newly remodeled.  Full kitchen with everything we needed to cook anything we wanted.  A very nice bathroom, shower, and 2 bedrooms.  We felt like we had complete privacy which was great for us.  But also we could ask Tuna for anything at any time.  Our first night there she drove us to a good grocery store where we could get food and helped us with any questions.  She made lentil soup for us, it was delicious!  Always she answered her phone and helped us whenever we got lost.  We got excellent directions on how to visit the Egyptian bazaar and walk up to the grand bazaar.  This way we got to go to the places with really good prices, and not waste our money at the overpriced grand bazaar.  This advice was amazing!  The yard/garden was the best.  We ate breakfast out there every morning.  The place is up on a hill and so it has a great view of Istanbul.  Really this is the most amazing place, quiet, peaceful and spacious in a central part of Istanbul.  And any difficulty finding the place or getting somewhere from there is not a problem with Tuna always so kind to help.  For the price, and the experience, and the host it is the best ever.  Just can't say enough good things about Tuna and the lovely house.  Kid, family, couple friendly.  Hope you will stay here, you will enjoy.  Happy to return and stay there in the future Tuna.

The property was very clean and cozy with a feel of a real home. The house facilities and the garden turned out exactly how they have been depicted on the photos and even more so.....Most importantly, it was the warmth and hospitality of Tuna and her family, that made our short stay so special. Tuna is a very special, kind and caring host. She helped us with every need, providing guidance and utmost hospitality, including freshly made Turkish pastry and chocolate cake as a surprise.  This place is made even more special by the presence of a gorgeous adopted dog Tamal. He is always kind, hospitable and open for a lively play and a nice piece of bread with cheese :). \r\n\r\nThe Lovely Garden is located in a very green, clean and safe neighbourhood in Anatolia (the Asian part of Istanbul), away from the everyday buzz and hectic lifepace. It is immersed in a residential area, very close to a beautiful Camlica public park. The area is nice for comfortable walks, if one is interested to observe local life in a residential part of Istanbul, away from the myriad of tourists, shops, industries and business centers. A number of local restaurants, bakeries and grocery shops are located at a walking distance. \r\n\r\nWe would highly recommend the Lovely Garden to someone, who is seeking to stay more in a family atmosphere in a quiet green area, rejuvenating oneself with the energy of trees and the magical sound of the call for prayer, which can be heard from the minarets of the nearby mosque. It is worth mentioning that Tuna's family also runs a cozy lodge in a green area in the vicinity of Istanbul. We would highly recommend this place as well to someone interested in a quiet retreat surrounded by nature. \r\n\r\nWe loved everything about the Lovely Garden and we have had a very lovely experience staying there! Above all, we would like to extend our hearty greetings to Tuna's family and thank her, her mother, her sister, her lovely daughter and son, the dog Tamal and her entire family for the warmth, hospitality and kind smiles. Sending you love and smiles from our hearts and wishing you all the best. \r\nWe do hope and look forward to stay in the Lovely Garden again!!! \r\nTashekullar, Tuna. \r\nWith warm reegards,\r\nAllan and Nigora\r\n"},{"_id":"12816275","date":{"$date":"2014-05-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"170150","reviewer_id":"12322802","reviewer_name":"Andrea","comments":"It was our first accommodation on airbnb, so we have no means of comparison.

It is very special to be in such a lovely location that is also very close to public transport that brings you to the European side quickly. The Kucuk Camlica park is right around the corner and is a wonderful place for a picnic, playgrounds, a Turkish tea and a fantastic view of Istanbul.

Дом в жизни лучше, чем на фотографиях - аккуратный уютный гостевой домик на одном участке с хозяйским, в глубине сада. Дом чистый, постели свежие, на кухне есть всё необходимое для готовки. Надо сказать, что к жилью мы предъявляем высокие требования, поскольку ездим с маленьким ребёнком, и были полностью удовлетворены: тихо, далеко от больших улиц, мы никому не мешали, и нам не докучали, прямо в садике можно погулять с ребёнком, а на соседней улице огромный ландшафтный парк с озером и утками. Район хороший: практически через забор живёт глава района, а в километре-двух резиденция президента страны. В 10 минутах ходьбы несколько продуктовых магазинов, недалеко станция метро. Огромное спасибо за приём хозяйке - Туне. Добрейшей души человек, щедрый, отзывчивый, прекрасный собеседник… Когда она узнала, что мы приехали лечить ребёнка - всячески искренне пыталась помочь, за что мы ей очень благодарны. С хозяйкой, её мужем и двумя детьми мы подружились, это действительно очень хорошая семья. Рекомендуем всецело. Жильё подойдёт и семьям, и молодым парам. \r\nEverything was great. Clean, comfortable and cosy house, safe and great location. Tuna is a charming and fantastic hostess, whom we now consider a friend. She and her wonderful family made us feel at home.

When we arrived at her place, we were thoroughly exhausted from packing up our lives in Ghana and a few nights of inadequate sleep, and the cottage was the perfect place to rest and recharge. It's fairly unadorned on the inside - just a couple of sparsely furnished bedrooms, a bathroom, and a small kitchen - but that was all we needed! The heat and hot water worked well, the bed was super comfortable, and we had a lovely view of the city from our bedroom window. It was too cold to enjoy the courtyard while we were there, but it looked like an ideal place to drink morning coffee, with two hammocks and a table and chairs.\r\n\r\nAll that said, what made our experience with Tuna really special was not the accommodation itself but our interaction with her and her family, who were absolutely the most gracious and attentive Airbnb hosts I've ever encountered (and almost all of my Airbnb experiences have been great). They greeted us upon arrival; walked us around the neighborhood to point out pharmacies, ATMs, supermarkets, and the like; and (most essentially) pointed us toward bus stops and even talked to the drivers to make sure we got on the right one. On the Asian side of Istanbul, at least in this particular area, not many people speak English, so this was a huge help - I don't know how we could have navigated the city's massive public-transit systems without it! Tuna invited us to accompany the family to their restaurant/lodge outside of town, where we had a lavish Sunday breakfast and took a short hike up into the hills. Her two teenage children were always happy to answer our questions and show us around. On our last night, they invited us into their home for tea and  a chat, and Tuna helped us arrange for a taxi to the airport that could accommodate all our many bags.\r\n\r\nWhile there are other Airbnb options that put you closer to the major sights in Istanbul, I don't think we would trade our stay with Tuna's family for anything! Highly recommended if you want a more local experience and a truly warm welcome."},{"_id":"28427912","date":{"$date":"2015-03-23T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"170150","reviewer_id":"26565733","reviewer_name":"Nasser","comments":"I stayed four night at Tuna's place.

I don't even know where to start. this was, by far, the best vacation EVER and honestly our wonderful host Tuna and her beautiful and warm family play a monumental role! from responding promptly my emails before we visited to the entire tenure of our stay of two weeks, she was an absolutely splendid host. I know I've made a friend for life. We intended to get a place on the Asian side, where we could be far off from the insanity of the tourism commotion but also be able to access it for sight seeing the usual popular sites and that's exactly what tuna's place is. the house was spotless, comfy and very relaxing and warm after a cold day out. The beds were clean, clean towels laid out, it was a lovely little home away from home for me, my husband and my 5 year old daughter. We even enjoyed the garden on sunny days, had tea outside, laid in the hammock and just unwind. the nearby bulgurlu market which is a downhill walk was also a pleasant surprise, the restaurants there were amazing and we got so comfortable with their excellent service ( and much more food for value) compared to the European side that we would have all our meals there. Tuna even took me to the local thursday market where i bought the cheapest and most amazing salmon and nuts and died fruit and she also showed me how best to cook the salmon! the second day tuna even showed us the Cagri departmental stoire which has all the groceries you might need and a lovely bakery where I shopped plenty of times! Right across the street is a wonderful spice shop with all kinds of exotic spices and teas. There is also a dizzying number of amazing bakeries, baklava and sweet houses, even clothes stores, all in the very easy vicinity of Tunas house. also a bus or mini van ride to Uskudar or Kadikoy and you can do all your souvenier and other shopping with much more variety and much cheaper than the European side. There's a 5 lira shop in Kadikoy that I went berserk in! Tuna very kindly explained the whole metro, bus and ferry ride system to us and we barely ever needed a taxi. She helped guide me with the entire itinerary. she was also amazingly helpful when we needed guidance of any kind when we were lost or confused about something, Tuna was just a phone call away! i know words can never suffice but if you want to experience the local warmth and feel of the turkish culture along with all the tourist attractions, this is the absolute best place. This was our first air bnb experience and tuna has set the bar extremely high for any successive air bnb bookings we make! We are definitely returning and this was, at the cost of sounding repetitive, the absolute best vacation ever!

Upon arriving back in the city after traveling in Greece we came to visit Tuna and her family and spent the day chatting. If I could, I would move into Tuna's backyard and set up camp! :):) My husband and I can't wait to visit again and when we do we will definitely contact Tuna to stay at home again.

She was always available to us and happy to offer help and advice. \nThe house itself is pretty, comfortable, and fully-equipped.

It has several playgrounds, lots of open spaces and a lovely duck pond --\n and don't forget to go up the famous hill when you're there, where you will find a nice restaurant overlooking an absolutely incredible view of Istanbul and the Bosphorus.

They had fig and plum trees that we enjoyed thoroughly. the location is superb; it's walking distance to 2 metro stations. it is surrounded by shops to buy pretty much anything. The park is very very close and is truly one of the most beautiful and biggest parks in Istanbul.

В доме всё так, как описано Tune. Нам очень понравилось постельное белье оно очень хорошего качества. Дома было тепло, хотя в некоторые дни выпадал снег и температура на улице была около 0 градусов, газовое отопление работало хорошо. Дом расположен на холме, если немного спустится, то можно попасть в магазины, где продают вкусный хлеб и ограниченный набор продуктов. Tune и Antonio отвезли нас на машине в супермаркет, где они покупают продукты, потом мы сами ходили в него, порядка 20 ходу мимо станции метро. До ближайшей станции метро M5 10 минут ходьбы с ребенком 3 лет, чтобы добраться до основных достопримечательностей, расположенных в старом городе вам нужно ехать на станцию Uskudar и пересесть на метро Marmaray , чтобы добраться до станции Sirkeci, время поездки на метро около 30 минут. Tune и Antonio пригласили нас отпраздновать Новый год в кругу своей семьи, это было очень интересно и необычно. Они очень хорошие и доброжелательные люди. Если мы будем в Стамбуле, то обязательно остановимся у них снова, так как там очень тихо и чистая природа вокруг. \nMy wife and two children spent all the new Year's holidays in this House. In the house everything is as described Tune. We loved the linens, it is of very good quality. The house was warm, although some days the snow fell and the temperature on the street was about 0 degrees, gas heating worked well. The house is located on a hill, if a little down, you can get to the shops, where they sell delicious bread and a limited list of products. Tune and Antonio drove us by car to the supermarket where they buy products, then we walked in it, about 20 minutes walk through the metro station. The nearest Metro station M5 10 minutes walk with a child 3 years to get to the main attractions located in the old town you need to drive to the station Uskudar and take the Metro Marmaray to reach the station SIRKECI, the time of the subway trip About 30 minutes. Tune and Antonio invited us to celebrate the new Year in the circle of their family, it was very interesting and unusual. They are very nice and friendly people. If we are in Istanbul we will definitely stay at them again as there is very quiet and clean nature around."}]}

The hosts, Yvonne and Cary, are very welcoming and convivial yet respectful of privacy. The house is modern with all mod cons. The large bedroom (with very comfy bed) is on the ground floor with a good deal of private space in which to relax. There's even a saltwater swimming pool in the back garden! The location is great for getting to the best of the city's beaches and Eastern Suburbs, with Bondi just 15 minutes walk and Rose Bay about 20. The nearest bus stop is just 5 minutes away. From here you can easily reach Bondi Junction, the city and beyond. \nThis is a quiet area, with the nearest shops and bars 10 - 15 minutes walk away, so maybe not an ideal place for the party animal.\nAs far as I'm concerned, after 7 weeks staying here, this place is perfect. My only negative is that any B\u0026B from now on will be a compromise.

The bus into Sydney is almost outside the house, so this provides a link to the rest of the extensive public transport system (a tram service will be available soon too).  Opposite Kathy’s house is the most amazing Centennial Park; lakes, walks, fantastic wildlife (including flying foxes roosting in the trees!) and a tasty coffee and snack mean you can spend a happy hour enjoying the peace and tranquility. \nThere is so much to see and do in Sydney you will never be bored. We bought tickets for a performance at the Opera House, took ferry rides and walked miles around the streets. The Rocks and Bangaroo are beautiful and fascinating if you are interested in history, social change and architecture. Bangaroo Reserve is ‘must see’! \nOutside of the CBD are many other towns some with lovely seaside fronts and beaches. The bus to Coogee Beach is about five minutes away and takes you right to the promenade with shops, cafes and glorious golden sands in less than twenty minutes. \nKathy is always on hand if you need some help and advice but you have your own space and privacy. A great place for exploring Sydney and the surrounding areas."},{"_id":"402250457","date":{"$date":"2019-01-17T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17028088","reviewer_id":"64486440","reviewer_name":"Kristin","comments":"Perfectly comfortable stay.

There are lovely new appliances, beautiful wooden floor boards and a super comfortable couch. The upstairs space is lovely although I did hit my head on the slopes a couple of times and I wished the windows over the bed opened. I also found the mirror too low for me to do my makeup! \nThe main thing that could have been improved for my stay was that I had picked the place because of the floorboards rather than carpet because I have severe asthma and allergies. Every time I stay somewhere I also have to ask hosts to clean with only bicarbonate soda/vinegar or water and ask for anything fragranced to be removed. I also asked if she used scented laundry powder. Kathy assured me that she understood my needs because her son was asthmatic. However I arrived to an automatic air ”freshener” IN in the house, two stinky bamboo stick diffusers hidden in drawers and extremely fragranced bed linen and towels. This meant that for the first night I had to wear a mask and try to air the place. To sleep I had to remove the pillow cases and cover with my own clothes and try not to breathe when using the towels. The whole experience made my asthma much worse and meant I was uncomfortable and un-well for the entire stay. \nAs an Airbnb host myself I think that the host community need to take requests such as these by guests very seriously and start to prioritize the need for clean and chemical free air over the need to “fragrance” a space."},{"_id":"417608459","date":{"$date":"2019-02-27T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17028088","reviewer_id":"24980384","reviewer_name":"Leonie","comments":"This is an amazing place to stay.

We've been in NY several times before and my goal was to find a place that was close to varies transportation options which the apartment location definitely delivers.\r\n\r\nThe department is exactly as described and displayed. It was nice and clean and we made full use of the kitchen several times which worked out fine. The Whole Foods grocery is in close distance to the apartment which was nice for us, since we didn't want to spend too much time trying to find a place for breakfast every morning. Suggest that you do some research ahead of time, so you have a whitelist for places that serve the best coffee, lunches etc.. We did and it made a big difference since food, coffee and wine is important for our trips. Daniel will be more than happy to provide you with a list of places you can try.\r\n\r\nWe found several good places to eat nearby, specially since pizza was one of our missions this time. And the good news is that many of the best pizza places in NY are (both in our and various blogs' opinions) located within a 3 miles radius from the apartment.\r\n\r\nMy trip was together with my teenage daughter, so didn't have a chance to try many of the really cool bars and entertainment places that's close to the apartment, but have to say that you have plenty of options close to the apartment if you want either live music, cool and/or cozy bars. I did visit a couple of wine bars during happy hour on  our way home to the apartment in the evening and it was just perfect. Make sure to do your research because there are a lot of options within 1.5 mile radius. \r\n\r\nA few other things that made a positive difference is that the Internet in the apartment is really good and stable. Since there's no television in the apartment we used my surface computer for various streaming services which worked out perfectly.\r\n\r\nThe weather while we stayed moved everywhere from warm to cold, but both the heat and AC worked fine (had a minor problem with the heat in the beginning, but it was an isolated problem for the entire building and was quickly fixed)\r\n\r\nI would definitely stay at Daniels place on my next visit to NY, primarily because of the apartment and Daniel as a host."},{"_id":"22408146","date":{"$date":"2014-11-05T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1704560","reviewer_id":"20056222","reviewer_name":"Simon","comments":"Beautiful apartment, well decorated.

It was a few minutes walk to some great shops and around the corner on Houston or Delancey there are enough breakfast places to keep you going - although we favoured the Clinton St establishment - just get there early!  And Morganstern's - if there was ever a reason to go get icecream at 10pm in the rain this is it - delicious and 5 mins away.\r\nTwo subway lines also in easy reach so very convenient for Manhattan or Brooklyn and the sky train.\r\nDaniel was easy to communicate with and made lots of lovely recommendations.

I asked him if he has parking opportunities or at least knows where to park: he blamed me for bad communication and did not care at all. He did not provide towels, so make sure to bring one if you stay here. The most upsetting thing was on the second day, when he asked me if I checked out so he can host another guest. I booked and payd for three nights and did not even think about to leave earlier. The only positive thing about my stay is the location. It is in the middle of Waikiki and everything is in walking distance. \n\nIf you do not care about all the above mentioned issues and just need a bed on Waikiki, you can book here.

Close indeed to beach, nightlife, grocery shopping, restaurants ...\nExcellent communication before, during and after stay. Keen eye for needs of their guests. Chico does not live in this particular place (Bennett does) but he kindly came by especially to welcome me and make sure I settled in okay - very much appreciated. And in the few minutes we spoke he managed to pass me some good tips and information. Both Bennett and Chico are kind and respectful. They work evenings/nights.\nKeep in mind this is a 'bachelor's pad' - clean and functional but not 'homey' - for me this was no problem - but maybe could be for other guests ...  The bathroom could use some TLC, but certainly more than acceptable on all fronts, no hygiene or bug issues in bathroom or kitchen. Kitchen well equipped with toaster, microwave, fridge, stove, pots, pans etc. \nThe only downside for me was that I did not manage to sleep (even with earplugs and after living together with 4 people in one room previously). It seems I underestimated the impact of being smack in the centre of waikiki on thanksgiving weekend. I felt there was a lot of noise from traffic, sirens, neighbours on balconies, doors slamming in the hallways (very windy weekend too), and quite some party-people in the street all night, plus water pipes running just next to the bed (rain and/or shower drains from above).

It’s in the heart of Waikiki - you can walk to the shops, to the beach or to one of the many buses that takes you pretty much anywhere - all within 5 minutes from the space. Fresh towels and sheets were provided. The room was decent size with a big closet. There truly isn’t a need for an a/c in the room! Despite it being in the busy, touristy area I slept great - really comfy bed and I didn’t hear much of the noise in the room. I would definitely stay here again if I’m back in Honolulu!

You get for what you pay for. Nothing more. Nothing less. Listing is as described. His responses and communication skills were very well.

Other than that everything was okay in my book. Especially for the price. \nMy favorite thing about this booking was the location.

The best part of all is the hospitality shown by Mike and his lovely family. We walked into this cozy and beautiful unit feeling at home right away. There was a basket of fruit and goodies along with a bottle of wine on the table for us to enjoy.  Communication was always clear and Mike responded promptly whenever we contacted him. He went above and beyond to make sure our stay at his place is pleasant and comfortable while respecting our privacy. It felt like home while being away from home. Kudos to Mike and family.

We had our private entrance. \n\nThe Airbnb was a large studio with a separate bathroom.\n\nAnd a kitchen that had a stovetop (no oven or toaster oven). The fridge was full size. There was also a washer and dryer unit. We used this twice and I loved that we could pack less and wash our clothes.\n\nThere was a TV and a dresser with lots of bins for “Guest Storage”. We filled these bins during our stay with baby stuff (clothes/diapers/wipes), and Alfy’s stuff.  On the bottom, were bins with extra guest supplies, such as extra blankets/towels and beach towels. There was another small closet by the bathroom with shelves where I put my stuff. There was a small boogie board and I believe an umbrella for the beach. While we didn’t use these things, it was really nice to have them as an option. \n\nThe bathroom was fairly large for the small space. The shower had a rain shower unit, but I would have preferred a regular showerhead. There was a lot of shelf space along the mirror shelf.\n\nWhen we arrived, we were greeted by the friendly host who showed us where to park our car. He then showed us our Airbnb and how the lock worked. He left out a welcome basket filled with Hawaiian treats like a pineapple, fresh fruits, and local snacks.\n\nThere was also cold water and Hawaiian drinks in the fridge, and a bottle of wine! \n\nWe were thrilled that the host went so far out of his way to make our stay enjoyable. I felt like we had Diamond status—no, I felt more like royalty!\n\nI also loved the sliding patio doors and the huge patio off our room. The natural light helped the place feel large, bright, and airy. At any time, we could go outside and enjoy some fresh air and the view!\n\nAlso for guest use is a large covered outdoor patio with a koi pond and waterfall, sofa, chairs, and game table. There’s a grill and table/chairs for a family meal. We had dinner there the last evening together and had a wonderful time. The weather was just right, and I loved the sound of the running water.\n\nThe hosts were very friendly, and the wife (named Joele), actually babysat our daughter on two separate occasions while we had a couple’s outing at the zipline, and a trip to Kualoa Ranch for the ATV tour. (Of course we paid her for her time). She was a wonderful sitter and my daughter fell in love with her. \n\nWe can't wait to go back to Oahu and would love to stay here again! We made wonderful new friends and had an amazing stay!"},{"_id":"244567014","date":{"$date":"2018-03-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17093333","reviewer_id":"175385385","reviewer_name":"Kenneth","comments":"Very comfortable, private, great location, great hosts.

He always got back to me promptly. When we were there I also had a few more questions and he answered usually within minutes, and always happy to help.\n\nMike is such a warm \u0026 welcoming host, I cannot say enough wonderful things about him and the guesthouse. \n\nI would recommend this Airbnb to all my friends \u0026 family without hesitation.

It is clean, bright, perfect in size for a couple or single person.   \n\nAll that you need to get started is there in the form of the gift basket with a mixture of healthy fruits as well as some sweet snacks.

The place looks identical to the photos here on airbnb. Everything is so new and modern and Mike makes sure to put extra little touches on everything in the guest house. Luckily the guests before us left early, so Mike was able to get us checked in earlier. This was very much appreciated because we were pretty tired from our plane ride in. Mike walked us through and had wine, a basket of fruit and snacks and water and drinks in the fridge. It is very rare that you encounter such a great host that provides you with these extra things, it was really nice! Mike also has beach towels and beach accessories, so you don't have to worry about bringing those items with you, or worry about going out to buy some. There is also shampoo, conditioner and body wash available, and a hair dryer too! The neighborhood is quiet, so if you are going to Hawaii to relax then this is the place to book. The parking spot in front of the main house is a bit small, so make sure you rent a compact car and you'll be just fine. We had a tiny Corolla and we fit with even some space to spare. I am already ready to visit the Island again and will definitely be looking to see if Mike's place is available to stay. Thanks for everything again Mike!

One of the best Airbnb experiences I’ve had. The studio was large, open and clean. It provided everything we needed including laundry, a full sized fridge, stove top, all the bathroom amenities you could want as well as beach towels, an umbrella, and a fantastic private balcony for lounging on at the end of each day. Mike also has a huge, beautiful outdoor living area with a grill and TV that he offered for us to use as well (shown in the listing photos) we were out most of the days so we didn’t get a chance to use it, but it’s a fantastic space. The bed was very comfortable and the air conditioning was great after a long warm day of hiking. Mike and his son were easily accessible and responsive but the apartment was very private. Highly recommended! The location is in a neighborhood near some great inexpensive, authentic restaurants and it is easy to access downtown, Waikiki, and the coasts while avoiding a lot of the traffic.

Il était présent pour nous accueillir à notre arrivée et nous montrer le studio, très sympathique. Nous avons apprécié le panier de fruits laissé à notre attention, ainsi qu'une bonne bouteille de vin. Des bouteilles d'eau et de jus étaient au frigo, ainsi que quelques condiments de base pour cuisiner. La propreté était impeccable, et le logement tout à fait conforme aux photos de l'annonce. On voit que Mike a le soucis du détail et nous n'avons manqué de rien : serviettes, serviettes de plages, 2 formats d'oreiller au choix, vaisselle, ustensiles, contenants pour les lunchs etc. Bien que la cuisine n'ait pas de four, le BBQ a été très utile. Nous avons bien aimé profiter de l'espace extérieur pour écouter la télé un peu le soir, ou relaxer en prenant un verre sous le gazebo. Bien que la résidence principale soit tout juste à côté avec ses occupants, nous avons vraiment eu un sentiment d'intimité dans notre espace. \n\nCôté emplacement, nous avons aimé être près de la ville! C'est très bien positionné pour visiter, à environ 15 à 30 minutes en auto de la plus part des visites que nous avons faites (Kailua Beach, Diamond Head, Waikiki, Hanauma bay, Pearl Harbor et de nombreuses randonnées) et environ 1 heure du North Shore et de la charmante ville d'Haleiwa.  Le quartier en lui même est résidentiel et perché dans la colline, mais à deux pas de la ville et des autoroutes. Les maisons y sont parfois en mauvais état, et d'autres très belles comme celle de Mike, mais en tout temps nous  nous sommes sentis en sécurité dans ce secteur, les résident y sont très tranquilles. On a vraiment trouvé nécessaire d'avoir une auto et d'avoir accès au GPS/réseau cellulaire pour s'orienter dans le quartier et dans la ville.  Il faut aussi prendre en compte des heures de pointe et de savoir les éviter pour traverser Honolulu via la H1, car le trafic peut être dense à certaines heures! (direction Est le matin, et direct Ouest le soir, souvent en sens contraire de nos plans heureusement.) Finalement si vous pensez cuisiner, il y a une épicerie Times tout près qui est très pratique, mais un peu chère. Ça vaut la peine de se rendre au Walmart pour débuter la semaine. \n\nAu final, un gros coup de coeur pour Oahu et pour notre séjour chez Mike, un voyage vraiment mémorable!"}]}

As a tourist I would not stay in this area again. To get to better beaches it's about a 15 minute drive north.\n\nThe check in process was not as easy as other AirBnBs. I met Fil across the street, and he said we had to go with him to get a day parking pass. According to him, each day we would need to get a pass. However, after speaking with the attendant, she gave us a week parking pass. To be fair, Fil was not rude, he was actually very courteous and patient.  \n\n"},{"_id":"172104650","date":{"$date":"2017-07-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17124786","reviewer_id":"60217366","reviewer_name":"Bryan","comments":"The place was great.

There are beach areas near the condo but not right there, though there is a small protected area to swim and play in the water.  But size was perfect for us for this vacation, exactly what we ordered.  He has AC and if you are a mainlander who is visiting and not used to the humidity and heat, well, you are gonna want to turn it on a bit and take advantage of the pool.  He has fridge and cooking and kitchen should you need it.\n\nSo, if you are looking for a big hotel and room service feel, this is NOT for you.

The condo has one of the best views you could ask for!! The view alone made it extremely difficult to leave! We loved listening to the ocean waves! The property has a security check point when entering the parking garage so I felt safe leaving my rental car at night. It's relatively quiet on the property and the only noise comes from the maintenance crew in the mornings (8am-9am). The property is very well maintained! Hardly anyone used the pool or jacuzzi but it was very clean. There are picnic tables near the pool if you'd like to enjoy a meal outside. Beyond the locked gates, you can access the beach. There's an outdoor shower near the pool so you can wash off after the beach.  There's also a laundry room on the main level near the property entrance. \nThe condo unit was very clean and has basically everything you need. Fil was kind enough to buy a couple of food items for us. We don't drink but there were several bottle of beers in the fridge, which would make for a very nice welcome to those who do.  Fil went above and beyond to make our stay very comfortable. Before our trip, I asked if there might be a shower chair for my elderly mother and he graciously provided one for her use.  \nThe beds were very comfortable, the bathroom was well stocked and the living room was spacious for us two.  Not gonna lie, it was pretty humid for this mainland girl but the box fan saved me!! \nIf given the chance, I would stay here again in a heartbeat!!"},{"_id":"271262792","date":{"$date":"2018-05-31T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17124786","reviewer_id":"156826452","reviewer_name":"Amber","comments":"The place was AMAZING !!!!

Be sure to spend some time at the lagoon, if you stay to the left hand side (near the breakwater) it tends to be only 3-5 feet deep. Go north a few miles and you will find some awesome waves to play in, but be sure you are a good swimmer. Down south of the property about 5 miles you will find some great beaches to see the sunset. The only thing I would be somewhat critical of is that the condo can be warm (this is likely just me, I like to sleep cold) but if you open all the windows you can sometimes get a great breeze though the whole condo. I was able to sleep quite well regardless :)"},{"_id":"288834965","date":{"$date":"2018-07-10T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17124786","reviewer_id":"36015072","reviewer_name":"Stephanie","comments":"Fil is amazing and his reviews and suggestions were so helpful.

The views from the house and tree house are beyond breathtaking and the owner is super nice and attentive. Upon arrival he sent a message to see if we got in OK and during the booking phase he responded immediately to our questions. The BBQ is state of the ark (very important!) and the place is totally set up for entertaining with a great coffee machine, two fridges, plenty of cutlery, glasses, plates etc ... . Everything has been thought of, from hats and repellant to hooks to hang out your wet beach towels. We will definitely be back.

The house exceeded all expectations. In an amazing location with a stunning view its was so nice to chill out and enjoy the peace and quiet in such a perfect setting. Clean, tidy and very homely, the house comes with everything you need (and more). Lots of outdoor space to have a bbq and eat with friends which was great. The beds were really comfortable and the tree house is very cool! To open up the doors each morning from there and see the ocean and boats was just lovely. I loved the fact that you had to get a little ferry over and use a wheelbarrow to get your shopping to the house - it all added to a little adventure away for a few days! Would highly recommend a holiday here!

Aside from all that the house has to offer, we also explored a little further afield with trail runs and bush walks in the surrounding areas.  \r\n\r\nWe also loved the remote feel of the location - we basically had the beach to ourselves, but it took us just under an hour to get there from Sydney, including the very quick ferry ride. \r\n\r\nWe have all returned to the city refreshed, and vowing to get back here as soon as we can.

Richard was a great host and easy to get in touch with. We stayed for 2 weeks and the weather overall was fantastic. We were thankful for this as the main house is small for two families (particularly when it's raining and you can't get outside). One small gripe was the main bathroom which is really in need of an update. The shower drain blocked a couple of times which we had to pump out. There were ants at night coming through the cracks in the wall. It was all pretty basic. The house is not cheap over the school holidays and at the rate we were paying we would have expected this to be in better condition. Overall we had a great stay.

Absolutely everything you could need for a comfortable stay was at your fingertips, not to mention the beach, view, sunrises and an amazing garden, and our family of 5 had a very memorable and unique long weekend there. The only thing worth noting for families with young kids is to be aware that the 'tree house', whilst stunning, is probably not suitable for children under the age of 8-10 if sleeping alone.

We used the cottage as a unique location for a film production. Richard was extremely helpful in providing local knowledge for ease of logistical preparations. The one trouble my team experienced was unrelated to the location, however, a result of the location's remoteness (only accessible by water). That problem was that the Barge Service cancelled on us due to unexpectedly rough (unsafe) water and wind conditions, which affected schedule on our bump in. You also must not forget anything as it is not practical to run errands if you forget to bring anything with you. Other than this, the film shoot went very well and everyone was excited by the cottage and its views. On another note: the neighbours were incredibly friendly and helpful. It was very easy to make contact with them, liaise with them leading up to the shoot and on the day they were very cooperative on a few requests of ours. The water taxi and barge service operators were also friendly, punctual and cooperative. I would recommend this place and hope to someday return for a weekend holiday to this paradise corner - it really is a hidden gem of Sydney."},{"_id":"319604050","date":{"$date":"2018-09-07T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1714235","reviewer_id":"209170063","reviewer_name":"Mark","comments":"Beautiful place, perfect view.

It's New York so if you're not used to small and tight apartments then you'll find out the struggle is real here. I only stayed from noon to about 6pm so I don't know how it is at night time. Unfortunately, when we stayed there it was like 60 degrees and the small rooms felt hot and humid even after opening the windows due to the windows facing the sun directly. I was surprised by the rooftop and don't want to spoil it for you but if you like to make most of what you have then you'll like it.

Joe was super cool and welcoming, always happy to help for anything. The room we had was pretty small for two people, but it s worth the price. We saved money for tours, restaurants and drinks  ;-).

Cool spiral staircase leads up to the rooftop with a nice night view of the skyline.

This was by far my favorite neighborhood I’ve ever stayed in, and Joe’s location is outstanding. Affordable restaurants, great super markets, and public transit are all around. Patisserie Florentine on 10th was my favorite place to get coffee and pastries in the morning, but there is also a great place on 11th (Veniero’s) for pastry. Westside Market on 3rd Ave is a nice market for fresh fruit and prepared foods. I loved Beyond Sushi on 14th Street for fast, fresh, affordable Vegan meals (and the people there were super friendly). The Strand Bookstore is a short walk away, and the L train is just two blocks away for a quick ride into Williamsburg/Brooklyn. UCB theater is a few blocks south for cheap, fun stand-up comedy, East Village Cinema is just a couple blocks away for indie/foreign films, and of course Union Square is just right down 14th. There’s also a Trader Joe’s on 14th but it is really crowded. Lots of fun stuff to do in the area. \n\nI am a female and traveled alone, often returning to the apartment very late at night, and I felt completely safe. The apartment is as represented—not flashy or glamorous, just basic, convenient, and affordable. The trickiest part was the shower—it’s got a mind of it’s own but it’s not a deal breaker. The room next to mine had two guests, and Joe had his own room. There is only one bathroom but I never had to wait more than 10 minutes to use it. At one point there were four other people in the apartment when Joe had a friend staying with him. Everyone was very very quiet and respectful of others when taking time in the bathroom. However, if you are someone who does not like sharing a bathroom with so many people (and it is a small bathroom) and you do not like walking up five flights of stairs, you should probably find another place. \n\nI could not have been happier with this location and will definitely return to the East Village."},{"_id":"260083553","date":{"$date":"2018-05-03T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17147561","reviewer_id":"47525580","reviewer_name":"Emilija","comments":"Great place - amazing roof terrace, good room, great location.

Nevertheless, you have enough space for your room and in the common areas (kitchen, living room, bathroom, and of course the rooftop). \nAC is very convenient on the hot days of the New York summer. There are units in the bedrooms and the living room. \nKitchen is easy to use, and Joe insists on the fact you can use whatever you need in there. \nBathroom is shared with Joe, and possibly another guest, but I never had to wait to use it. It’s a little old (but then again, old building) but clean. Be careful to the hot water in the shower: it seems to have a mind on its own ;)\nBedroom is not super big, but you have a large and comfortable bed and a closet to hang your clothes (for the bedroom I was renting, that closet is in the living room, that is not at all an issue). \nAnd finally, up one last flight of stairs, you have access to a private rooftop over the city. Perfect for the morning coffee or a drink after a day visiting. That was the little plus!\nJoe is a very kind guy, that makes everything he can to help you have a nice stay, he’s very quiet and let you a lot of space in his own home. \n\nOverall a nice stay in a nice appartment with a nice host!"},{"_id":"312015239","date":{"$date":"2018-08-22T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17147561","reviewer_id":"76742993","reviewer_name":"Lindsay","comments":"Joe is a very welcoming person and felt us right at home."},{"_id":"312459745","date":{"$date":"2018-08-23T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17147561","reviewer_id":"209814237","reviewer_name":"Erin","comments":"If you’re traveling light and need a cozy place to crash, Joe’s is the place to be.

Thank you for your interest in one of our vacation rentals.  We are a TEAM of professionals who manage individually owned condo apartments for the owners when they aren't using them within several different condo / hotel buildings in Waikiki.   We offer a range of accommodations types from small studio apartments (with or without kitchenettes) to 2 bedroom residences with full kitchens.  \r\n\r\nWe want your stay to be an enjoyable one and finding the right match for you is key.  As a general guideline, there are many different types of buildings and hotel-type of arrangements.  For those doing Hawaii on a budget, studios offer the best of both worlds providing a clean, private place to stay within walking distance to the BEACH at affordable prices (vary for upgrades, views, cooking abilities).   For those looking for nicer or larger accommodations, then you should target $150/night off season to $250/night peak season (vary for upgrades, views, cooking abilities, building amenities, parking included).  If you are looking for an Ocean-front experience, then target $350- $400/night and for a luxury experience, $500 to over $1000/night.  Hawaii offers something for everyone at every price point!  \r\n\r\nOur vacation rental units are privately owned and managed.  We offer an alternative to the hotel experience allowing our guests to “live like a local” in paradise whether be for a few days, a few weeks or a few months.  Our units are well maintained, repaired when necessary and treated routinely with pest control services.  We try not to interrupt our guests during their stay, and if the unexpected happens, we do our best to resolve it quickly with the least inconvenience to our guests.   Upon arrival, we try to meet all our guests personally to register, check-in, and answer any questions.  And if you’re running late don’t worry, we can make arrangements no matter the hour and register you in the office the next day.  \r\n\r\nStop by our real estate office, ground floor of Kuhio Village.  We are there daily to assist and share this incredibly beautiful island, local eateries, activities and entertainment found in Waikiki and around the island.  We look forward to hosting you in one of our vacation rental units and helping to make your stay a fantastic one.

The building is centrally located and is very close to the Sheraton, Dukes and Sky Waikiki; however, the room is a much older unit. We actually had some issues with the water upon arrival. After a lengthy flight from the East Coast we were looking forward to a shower, but to our unortunate surprise the water was brown. In addition, we noticed that the blinds above the AC unit had gaps. We were concerned about mosquitos getting in. We brought both of these concerns to our Hawaii Dream Realty rep and she went out of her way to try to find us somewhere else to stay. Luckily they own several units and they were able to place us in another room until the water issue was fixed (we would have to just deal with the blinds). However, the room they moved us to (temporarily) only had one bed. We had specifically chose the original room because it offered two double beds for the three adults that would be staying. Our 3rd friend was taking a later flight so Hawaii Dream Realty offered us the smaller room for the time being. The water was a major concern so we took the smaller room. They told us that it was technically an upgrade because it was a newer unit. It must be said again that they did make efforts to be as accommodating as they could be; however, we were paying for a room for three adults. After being moved back to the original unit (water issue resolved), we mentioned this to Hawaii Dream Realty; but they offered no additional compensation because they said that they had to cover cleaning costs for the alternate room that they provided. We accepted the situation, but it had not been our fault that the displacement occurred in the first place and this was slightly bothersome. The room that we returned to after two days continued to provide some unpleasant surprises. The last two days we were visited by 3 cockroaches which probably got in through the blinds since we saw one on the balcony one evening. We were careful not to leave food out and were pretty clean since we spent minimal time in the room besides bedtime and showers. Also, the building had only one functioning elevator during our stay so we always needed to leave extra early to account for the amount of time it took for the elevator to get to us. Hawaii Dream Realty did check up on us throughout the rest of our trip, but we had a packed schedule. We do not recommend staying in this particular unit; however, Hawaii Dream Realty has other more promising units and they were very pleasant to deal with.

Location: the location of this property can’t be beaten. It’s within minutes of walk to the Waikiki shopping plaza, International Marketplace, Waikiki beach, and popular eateries such as Marukame Udon, Marugo Brothers, Masubi Cafe, etc. There’s a Cajun shrimp restaurant right on the first floor of this apartment as well!\n2. Free parking: since we rented a car for our vacation, having a designated parking spot in the apartment definitely saved us a lot of money and hassle.\n3. Responsiveness: the property manager was extremely responsive to my messages and always responded to my inquiries quickly.\n4. Good AC unit: the air conditioning in the room was good and reliable, which was essential for the tropical weathers of Honolulu.\n\nNow onto the minor minuses:\n1. Intermittent WiFi: we had trouble with the WiFi as soon as we checked in. When we called the property management office, we were given the phone number of the cable company and was asked to call them ourselves. I was a little put off by this. In my mind, this should be something that is resolved by the property owner, especially since we were not even the account holder and did not have the authority to call and inquire about WiFi services.\n2. Clogged kitchen sink: we found the kitchen sink to be clogged during our check in. The property manager offered to have a handyman to come and fix it. But since we didn’t want to deal with the hassle, we declined the offer.\n3. Shower temperature: the water temperature in the shower fluctuated a lot. The water got hot really quickly, but sometimes would turn lukewarm or cold for no reasons.\n4. Check in process: in my check in instructions, I was asked to call 10 minutes before my arrival at the apartment so someone could come and hand me the keys. Well, I called 15 minutes ahead of my arrival, but still ended up waiting another half hour upon my arrival before someone showed up to give me the keys. A half hour wait was painstakingly long when you had two screaming 2yo toddlers in the car.\n\nAll in all, we had a great stay at this property despite the small inconveniences. If the property manager can get on top of the negatives that I’ve mentioned, this could easily become a 5-star experience for us."},{"_id":"337595377","date":{"$date":"2018-10-16T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17155854","reviewer_id":"69332153","reviewer_name":"Reina","comments":"Hawaii Dream Realty TEAMs place was very comfortable. \nThe location is excellent!

You are literally in the heart of Waikiki, which is great because the unit comes with parking and you can walk anywhere you need to! \nThe pool is located on the 6th floor, closes at 7pm. It isn't anything fancy at all. \nThere are laundry facilities right across the hall, but no information in the unit on needing a laundry card which you can only get during business hours from the front desk. \nOur check in experience was not great - no information was provided on the paperwork required, only one key provided which is inconvenient as you need the key fob to use the elevator, agent didn't know where the pool was located. \nThere are nice little amenities provided - Hawaiian coffee, teas, small toiletries, paper towel, dish soap."},{"_id":"410164397","date":{"$date":"2019-02-09T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17155854","reviewer_id":"228540816","reviewer_name":"Tasuku","comments":"買い物やﾋﾞｰﾁにも近く最高のﾘｯﾁ!また､ﾁｪｯｸｲﾝやﾁｪｯｸｱｳﾄの変更などにもｽﾑｰｽﾞに対応して頂き大変助かりました!少しだけ古い建物ですが､特に気にならなかったです!"},{"_id":"414475043","date":{"$date":"2019-02-19T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17155854","reviewer_id":"210932615","reviewer_name":"Bryian","comments":"MS608's claim to fame is it's location, it is an older property which could use a refresh especially in the bathroom.

I highly recommend visiting Ping Pong Gintonería. An old ping pong supply store turned into a popular Spanish drinking hole.\nMTR station has 2 exits just 3 mins walk/escalator ride away.

Probably a bit crammed for two if you're staying longer than a couple of days. It has absolutely everything you might need during the stay, which is great, though a second set of sheets/duvet covers would be lovely for longer stays.\nOne thing to consider is the humidity - Hong Kong in general is humid but it felt extra stuffy in this flat, compared to three other places on the island I've lived in over the past few years. The only solution was to run the AC even though it wasn't particularly hot.\n\nThe location is excellent, right next to Centre Street and its escalator. Lots of eateries and cafes around, plus the market hall is just down the street. The MTR is a short walk away. The location comes at a small price though: while there isn't really a lot of traffic in the street itself, the shops will get their groceries delivered in the (EARLY) mornings right underneath the flat and across the street - the running engines are really loud and woke me up every day until I started sleeping with ear plugs. It's surprisingly quiet otherwise though.

This isn’t a problem though as you’re likely to spend more time out of the apartment than in it. It’s a very convenient location to many different style of restaurants as well as to the MTR (trains), trams and taxis. It’s also a very walkable location to many places. The bedroom is larger than a lot of HK bedrooms and is plenty of room for a couple. \n\nThe bathroom is on the smaller side and the shower area is more of a long and narrow one rather than wide. Small bathrooms are also fairly common in HK apartments of this size (as are kitchens) so if you’re concerned about the size of this one, you may want to ask the size of the bathrooms at the other places you research before booking. It was fine for me and I didn’t expect it to be any bigger than it was. If you are looking for something bigger, it is likely you would also have a bigger lounge area and it would also be more expensive as a result. \n\nWilliam and Jackie were very helpful throughout my stay (and even prior) and answered all my questions promptly. They were both very helpful and I’d be fine with staying here again. Great location, small apartment (all I needed!) and great hosts."},{"_id":"247287908","date":{"$date":"2018-03-28T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17161494","reviewer_id":"23987717","reviewer_name":"Jerry","comments":"I was staying in William’s home for two weeks in late Mar.

Las camas son comodas, las almohadas y acolchados tambien. Hay que sacarse los zapatos apenas entrar.\nLas areas comunes bien, pero tampoco se utilizan mucho, mas que la cocina, que si usamos.

The AirBnB had a great location and the space was perfect for getting some sleep and catching a shower at the end of each day. It could have been a little cleaner,  it it was minor things like hair and dust on the floors. ALSO, we would recommend that you verify the passcode before your arrival. We were sent the wrong one, but fortunately Joe answered our first phone call and gave us the correct one (but you might not be so lucky, so check beforehand, haha)! \n\nWe give this AirBnB 4.5/5 stars!

Walk ten minutes to the Lilyfield light rail station to enjoy a beautiful scenic ride to Glebe, Ian Thorpe Aquatic Centre, Darling Harbour and the City.  In the daytime, ride the bus to trendy and colourful Newtown.","notes":"","transit":"I am near to bus stops on several routes to the City and Newtown. There is on street parking outside my house available for guests. Feel free to message me if you would like details.","access":"The studio now has a kettle, microwave and bar fridge. You are also welcome to use the kitchen in the main house. It has an older gas stove which works well, but needs to be lit by hand. Guests who have experience with this type of stove are welcome to use it. As well as the gas stove, the main kitchen has a microwave and a fridge. Washing up is by hand. You also can share the house's verandah that can be sunny or shaded by means of a retractable awning. The verandah can be used for relaxing as well as eating meals. You will need to have footwear on the verandah as its surface is a little rough (but it meets safety standards and is still a lovely spot). Meals can also be eaten in the kitchen/living area that looks out onto the verandah and garden.  Happy to put on a load of washing for you washing every 3-4 days. I'll want you to peg it on the line, if that's okay. Drying is by means of pegging on a clothesline (it seems like the right thing to do in this warm dry country).","interaction":"I am often at home working on report writing. I also occasionally go away for a few days. I am well organised when I travel, so I make sure my guests are happy.","house_rules":"Please take care of all components of my property and try to avoid all damage, including minor damage. If minor damage occurs, could you let me know? I will be kind review wise if you tell me about the damage and we discuss what should be done. It is a quiet neighbourhood, so I would want you to keep the noise to normal suburban home levels when outside the cabin. However, if the door is shut and the windows are only open a little, you can  make noise in the cabin and it will be fine.  I do not want any parties. I accept smoking outside provided no-one else who is present is uncomfortable with it. I have had smokers stay and they have used my outdoor seats and the verandah and that has been fine. Note that it could be cold out there at night, particularly in June, July and August. Also, be careful not to put any item over, or within 30 cm of, the heater. Otherwise, there is a risk of fire. It is important to turn the heater off when you are out.

Susan is a friendly, relaxed and hospitable host. The cabin is spotlessly clean, cute, and had a very comfortable bed. Angelo the cat was sometimes chatty but not annoying. The area is convenient and easily accessible by public transport but also suburban which would be interesting for international visitors. The only drawback of the location is the overhead flight path which woke me on Sunday morning, although I went back to sleep once I realised what the noise was!

We also enjoyed having our breakfast on her verandah. It was very peaceful.  Susan's home is located in a great Sydney suburb that's close to lots of great restaurants and cafes.

If you're looking for a sterile modern glass and  plastic accommodation - this is not for you. This little cabin is a separate part of a warm and friendly real home, - our cabin had it's own privacy, charm and character, and the en-suit was small but perfectly fitted and extremely functional. \r\nWhen we first realized we had to walk through the house to get to our accommodation, we were a little daunted, but we need not have worried, nothing was simpler and we had our own keys to come and go as we pleased.

As I was staying with a vegan friend and a gluten-free/lactose-free friend, the food options were really great.\r\n\r\nAt one point one of my travelling companions had an allergic reaction to her cat, and on the way out, we casually asked if she might have some Telfast or something similar, and she was more than happy to provide that.

Susan gives a wonderful spread of healthy breakfast everyday, which I greatly appreciate. Upon arrival, she also gave a complete set of linen and towels which is a service above and beyond that which is common. \r\n\r\nThe bed in the cabin was so comfortable that I slept through the nights like a baby. Susan also gave me a lift to the nearby weekend market which was really nice, and the market has many fabulous stalls and produce.

Firstly because Susan is a delightful host - she's warm and welcoming and helpful and generous! I have some allergies, and Susan was so helpful in making everything work for me. The studio itself is clean, nicely presented, self contained, quiet and has everything you need to make it a great base for a few days in Sydney. There's an ensuite bathroom, sitting area, TV, tea-making facilities. Glad it was cosy, as Sydney turned on some chilly days (which we thought we'd left behind in Canberra!). Leichardt is close to the city and an interesting area with plenty of eating places nearby. All in all a great place to stay.

We arrived 6.5 hours before check in and Susan was amazing and accommodating, letting us go in early and cleaning up the room a bit. She then helped take us into town and buy a train pass. It was amazing for a first day. Susan is the most helpful person I have ever met and she actually cares that you have an amazing stay in her house. She helps every step of the way and doesnt let anyone fall through any vacation cracks; whether it is getting lost, grocery shopping, buying dinner, or car troubles Susan refuses to let you make a wrong decision and will stick by you through the worst of them!

The cabin was spacious, kitted out with a book selection, a digital TV, kettle and heater, pretty much everything. The place was pristine and my nights were very peaceful.

Although loud, for me was an excellent way to wake up and begin my explorations of the city. Also, Im a big fan of airplanes, so I was delighted to watch and listen them pass overhead. But don't worry, at the night they stop and it is possible to sleep very well.\n\nThe studio was comfortable. And is provided with a bookshelf full of books.

It is a 5 minute walk to a beautiful beach with snorkelling, two restaurants, and sea turtles. By the beach there is also a rental place where you can do a week rental of all snorkelling equipment for $20 which I recommend. The place is very clean, has a bunch of amenities, and also has some beach accessories. We came as a couple but we able to make a couple breakfast meals and just relax instead of always having to go to a restaurant. It is about 45 minutes from the airport but is only 20 minutes from the main town of Lahaina (which is great to walk around, shop, and eat) and 10 minutes from kanapali which has a lot of great restaurants and shopping. If I were to come back to Maui I would stay in this same area! \nDonell has been fantastic, accommodating, and very open to offering advice and tips. We thank her very much for her help! \nMahalo!

My husband and I stayed 3 nights when our own condo was undergoing some maintenance.  I have to say that renting from Maria was an absolute pleasure.  Her condo is clean and fresh and perfect for anyone who really wants to experience authentic Maui living. Maria's home is located in a very private and tranquil area of the property.  I'm grateful the time we rented fell on my days off from work because I got to enjoy reading on the lanai, grilling dinner and night swimming in the evening at the common area pool (hubby and I do this anyway, but this felt like an actual getaway!).  Also, the breezes everyone talks about? They're amazing.  It's a special place.

I'm from the west side of Maui and really love Napili. Kapalua has excellent restaurants and is very close by. The condo had a couple little things that made it seem very \"lived in\" like a dirty bar of soap in the shower. The towels smelled a little musty. You must be VERY quiet as it was only two of us there, going to bed by 9:30 PM and still got a note on our car. It read \"we can hear you walking heel tow down the stairs\".

Secluded, quiet, homey and walking distance to gorgeous Napili Beach (and short drive to Ka’anapali to the south).   Walking distance to the great Gazebo restaurant, which everyone should indeed try if staying here.  Some of the great positives about this apartment are:\n\n- Great WiFi\n- peaceful, secluded and close drive to everything \n- spacious kitchen and fridge for those looking to cook in\n\nOnly two things to be privy of:\n\n1) While we enjoyed how quiet and peaceful the community is, the HOA does monitor neighborly noise.  Leaving and returning to the apartment at early / late hours (as one is apt to do on vacation), can be met with skepticism and watchful eyes of the neighbors below and to the side.

She was very honest in her description.  While there was no AC, leaving the windows open and having the fans running kept everything cool.  I actually needed to use the blanket at night in July.  The neighbors were friendly and were very helpful when I was confused where Maria's location actually was.   The walk to a nice beach is only several minutes away.  The actual location was really nice.  The stove and kitchen were normal sized with enough pots and pans to prepare food for the week.  The large TV had a bluray player that allowed us to log into our Netflix and Hulu accounts.  There were also a lot of beach toys at the location.  Maria was super helpful.  I \n would get a response less than 5 minutes after asking.  She was able to answer any questions I had, and I had many.

I have never expected I would use such word but I can't find a better word to describe. When I arrived at train station under a weather of heavy rain, she drove to pick me up. Even with umbrella she was soaked and became sick on the next day. I fell very sorry about it. She is very patient and helpful. Everyday she planned a tour for me according to my condition and explained it in very details. She is considerate and took care of my needs during the stay; while she respects the privacy that she never came to the room without asking. I was stupid enough to have booked a flight in the early morning that no metro operates yet, but she was so kind to get up very early, drove her car and took me to the airport. It is an unforgettable experience.\r\nRegarding the room, it is very spacious that could let 3 people stay comfortably. It has a well-equipped kitchen area, a living-room area with sofa and table, a resting area with a huge sofa bed facing a big TV set, an office area with desk and a row of electric plugs, a music area with a complete set of jazz drums, and of course, a bathroom.\r\nThe room is next to a garden which might be a great place to enjoy the spare time. Unfortunately the weather was not good during my stay so I cannot say much about it.\r\nThe location is not the most convenient but good enough. By 10 min walking I can find metro stations, and within 3-min walking distance there is bus heading downtown.\r\nThere is a dog in the house. She is cute and hyperactive that it would be great for pet-lover. In case one does not like dogs, Alexandra would help to separate her from the guests."},{"_id":"48244403","date":{"$date":"2015-09-24T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1719942","reviewer_id":"2333095","reviewer_name":"Macrina","comments":"This is by far the best airbnb experience we have had on this trip.

Toujours pleine d'attention, elle vous accueille avec le sourire, la gentillesse et plein de petites attentions (par exemple, et ce n'est qu'un exemple elle vous réserve jus de fruits, petites victuailles, viennoiseries..). Malgré son emploi du temps très chargé, elle sera toujours disponible pour le moindre petit renseignement. Pour revenir à l'appartement, tout a été parfaitement pensé et conçu. De plus le côté créatif et artistique d'Alexandra se retrouve dans la décoration et le raffinement de cet appartement. Je souhaites à tous de vivre une telle expérience dans une ville qui elle-même est accueillante et chaleureuse. Pour finir c'est le cœur lourd que je suis parti tant je me sentais bien. Lors de mon séjour j'ai eu la chance de beaucoup discuter avec Alexandra mais aussi son frère qui lui-même est un homme plein de chaleur humaine.  Le papa d'Alexandra et de Jorge est aussi un homme de cœur, chaleureux, et j'ai passé aussi des moments inoubliables en sa compagnie. Bref une famille merveilleuse. Je tiens à les remercier tous pour tout ce qu'il m'ont apporté durant ce séjour. Ils ont tous les trois une place importante dans mon cœur et je reviendrais le plus rapidement possible. Obrigado Alexandra, Antonio, Jorge et...Fox un chien adorable. Je vous embrasse tous les 3 très forts !"},{"_id":"160312218","date":{"$date":"2017-06-13T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1719942","reviewer_id":"1184966","reviewer_name":"Josee","comments":"Notre séjour chez Alexandra fut vraiment formidable.

A Alexandra realmente merece a denominação de \"super anfitriã\". Tudo neste sítio é impecável!\nDepois de um cancelamento a 1h antes da nossa viagem por parte de um outro anfitrião, não podíamos ter encontrado melhor (ficando assim agradecidos à outra pessoa que cancelou). Mesmo em cima da hora, foi nos obtida uma resposta e confirmação super rápida no seu espaço. Tanto a Alexandra, como o seu Pai e a cadela Fox, são do mais amáveis e simpáticos que já conhecemos. Fomos ao Porto a um festival e de início ficámos receosos se os nossos horários poderiam perturbar pelo estúdio ficar na casa deles, mas não houve qualquer problema e demonstraram-se bastante atenciosos e preocupados visto o tempo ter sido tão frio e chuvoso (também o meu namorado a certo dia adoeceu e tentaram sempre ajudar; até com os horários de check-out uma vez ter sido uma viagem um pouco cansativa para nós). Relativamente ao espaço, nota-se no cuidado do design e limpeza. Realçamos a cama ser tão confortável e os pequenos \"mimos\" que nos foram deixados.\nCertamente que  quando voltarmos ao Porto quereremos repetir a experiência!  Não podíamos esperar melhor!"},{"_id":"306276935","date":{"$date":"2018-08-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1719942","reviewer_id":"27115441","reviewer_name":"Loreta","comments":"The best AirBnB experience ever! I felt at home, I felt loved, Alexandra was like my sister who went above and beyond to make sure I had the best experience in Porto. \nHome is beautifully designed by Alexandra, authentic azulejo tiles combined with the graphic comic book elements, all made by our creative host - from pictures hanging on the walls to pillows and chairs and dressers. \nMe and my husband stayed downstairs (enjoyed spiraling stairs so much!) and we had everything we needed for a great stay as a couple - privacy, tv with a lot of channels and great movies (in English with subtitles in Portuguese), coffee maker, fridge, sink, bar, all the stylish dishes, even food! (there was water, coffee, milk, cheese, ham, bread, yoghurt, fruit...)  Private bathroom with toilet, sink and shower, we were able to walkout to Alexandra’s beautiful garden and enjoy her lovely flowers and designs there too! \nAnd the dog! Our Foxy! Such a happy and sweet girl! Unconditional love. We loved to play with her every day. \nWe also got the best tips and advices what to visit, where to eat, what to do in Porto, and since we don’t speak Portuguese we really appreciate Alexandra’s perfect English skills and needless to say we enjoyed our everyday conversations. \nFrom the very first day we arrived when she made a reservation to watch the sunset from the best spot in the city (there’s a rooftop restaurant otherwise we didn’t know about) till the last day she booked Douro River tour through her friends agency getting us last two seats on a very short notice. Alexandra drove us to eat, to trains, she did our laundry, she let us stay longer... I could go on and on... She is a woman with a heart of gold and I feel like I’ve known her forever. I will definitely stay at her place next time I’m in town. Highly recommend Alexandra’s home to anyone who is visiting Porto. \nThank you my sweet friend for everything!!! God bless you and your family! \n\n"}]}

Individually adjustable air conditioning in each room definitely compensates for the hot temperatures of Barcelona, especially during the summer (we went at the end of June).\r\n\r\nThe spacious home is tastefully decorated with plenty of storage space for longer periods of staying.  The 3 bathrooms were perfect for our group of 8 and the fully furnished kitchen was great to cook in.  The stoves are gas driven which means they are great for people who want to have better control and power over their cooking (though starting it up does require the use of either a lighter or a match).  The building was well-secured with elevators available for those who may not want to go up the 3 flights of stairs.\r\n\r\nBoth a plus and a minus, the apartment is located in a prime location with plenty of nearby restaurants, amenities, supermarkets, etc. for daily needs and is located close by to the subway.  Unfortunately, that also means that being located on a main street does mean there is the average level of city traffic noise.  Nothing that really bothered us, but for those who may want a totally tranquil location with zero noise, it might not be ideal.\r\n\r\nJordi was a wonderful host!  Well-mannered, sensitive to our needs, and also helped us to book a vehicle for getting to the cruise ship terminal.  He was great to deal with, and even when there was a slight booking conflict when we first made the booking, it was quickly resolved with an upgrade to this particular location for the same price.  Overall, a pleasure to deal with!\r\n\r\nAll in all, you won't regret booking this apartment!"},{"_id":"36418566","date":{"$date":"2015-06-28T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1720909","reviewer_id":"19767453","reviewer_name":"Jean-Pierre","comments":"Remarquable appartement , bonne location , hotel à l'écoute et réactif "},{"_id":"38916683","date":{"$date":"2015-07-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1720909","reviewer_id":"13271330","reviewer_name":"Tomás","comments":"Tuvimos una excelente experiencia.

My tips for future guests would be to keep an eye on the elevator weight limit (there's an indicator that fills up as you get in) and to bring earplugs since there is a lot of traffic noise outside that filters in (the downside of its central location). There's a TV but no sound system. Corner stores, cafes, and great shopping are close by - we loved being able to walk to the hip Born area. Blackout curtains also a plus with our jetlag.

Cucina con arredi ed elettrodomestici nuovi. Posizione comoda per metro. L'intero palazzo é destinato ad appartamenti in affitto. Non abbiamo avuto necessità di utilizzare l'aria condizionata ma ogni camera ne é provvista. Unica pecca gli infissi in legno vecchi e senza doppi vetri. A tutte le ore, notte compresa, si sente in sottofondo il rumore della trafficata via sottostante.

All the bedrooms are spacious and have their own air conditioners. The front area of the common space was our favorite place to hang out. Big doors open up making it feel like the whole space is a veranda. The only issue we had was that the washing machine was broken. I was there for a week, and continuing to travel after leaving so I really needed to wash some clothes. Jordi was responsive dealing with this, however, and did offer to pay to have the laundry done by a service. There were also not many supplies in the kitchen for cooking or cleaning. But all and all, the apartment is a great find. Centrally located, right near the metro, easy to walk to lots of places.

Why waste your time driving, when from the Aloha Suite your adventure is a short drive away. Want to see other side of the Island a mere one hour and 30 minutes gets you to some amazing beach sites. After a day of exploring, end the night by listen to the sounds of the ocean ","neighborhood_overview":"Hawaiian Paradise Park (also known as HPP) is located in the Puna District of East Hawaii, approximately 15 miles southeast of Hilo. This subdivision fronts State Highway 130 and stretches 4 miles to the Pacific Ocean and is 3 1/2 miles wide. The community is close to shopping, dining, and cultural activities in Hilo, Volcano, and Keaau. Of all the subdivisions in lower Puna, HPP is closest to Hilo, meaning shorter commute times to Hawaii’s second largest city – the business heart of east Hawaii.","notes":"We hope your stay with us brings some aloha to your life that will last a life-time.

What a great experience! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND staying at this location. It was inexpensive and a perfect situation for us. My wife and I life on the west side of the Big Island and wanted to do a one week \"Staycation\" on the east side. We love hiking around Volcano National Park and we enjoy exploring Hilo on occasion too. Alan and Lori's place was centrally located for us. We just needed a bed, a fridge, a microwave, a bathroom and a grill. Alan and Lori's place provided all that but so much more as well.\n\nRight from the start they were very responsive to questions and our planning. We were fortunate to not have someone staying there the night before or the night after our stay so Alan made early checkin available to us and offered a later checkout option as well, through we had to leave early in the morning to get back home.\n\nThe Aloha Suite was a great space! High ceilings, and very comfortable. Alan and Lori live in the house about 30 yards from this separate building. They are available if you need them but they don't hover. You can have \"getaway private time\" or you can chat with them. Your choice. \n\nWe cooked on the grill outside most nights under the covered lanai, and ate out there as well. We popped popcorn in the microwave inside and relaxed with a little Netflix several nights right before bed to unwind after a long day of hiking and exploring the east side of the island. Direct TV is an option as well and there are quite a few movies and shows available on the DVR. \n\nAlan and Lori have put together a great booklet overview of places to see, places to eat, places to shop, etc. around the island with spot-on information. They are very personable and attentive, friendly people. We felt very welcomed and safe at the property. \n\nIt was very clean when we arrived, Alan was there to greet us at check in. They provided some popcorn, coffee, juice drinks and other little hospitality touches that were very appreciated. The bed was comfortable and the fans scattered around the suite kept things at a comfortable temperature.\n\nAgain, we HIGHLY RECOMMEND the \"Aloha Suite\" of Alan and Lori and I am certain we will stay there again when our next east side staycation craving hits."},{"_id":"204579305","date":{"$date":"2017-10-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17252454","reviewer_id":"25753439","reviewer_name":"Susan","comments":"By far the best rental and experience I have ever had on the Big Island.

For starters it is in the best location you could possibly imagine - about a 5 minute walk to the São Bento metro stop and within short walking distance of pretty much any place you want to go. If you are up for it, even the Casa da Musica is only about a 40min walk away.  The studio itself is tiny, but exactly as pictured - extraordinarily clean, lovely brand new supplies and modern facilities and very important, a hot hot shower.   I didn't meet José, but Mario greeted me when I arrived and gave me a map on which he pointed out all the sights and gave me a bunch of suggestions about where to go. He was also extremely accommodating when I asked to leave my bag for the day after I checked out. The only small thing I would say is that if you are extremely sensitive noise, it can be a bit noisy on the street and also the studio was very cold in mid-November. But I didn't ask them to turn on the heating, so I accept blame for that one!  Overall, highly recommend.

Очень понравилось наличие полного набора кухонных принадлежностей, чай, кофе, сахар также в наличии, и можно сразу же сварить чашечку кофе после долгого перелета. В ванной комнате также было все необходимое, включая профессиональный фен (у меня дома он попроще), единственное, мне не хватало маленькой полочки в душе.  Дизайн комнаты прост, но мне очень понравились белые тона мебели, которые гармонировали с теплым натуральным полом, я бы сказала, что именно это сочетание цветов, мебели и помещения идеально подходили друг к другу, а традиционные белые ставни добавили местного колорита, получилось красиво и ничего лишнего. Wi-Fi  в комнате работал хорошо, без сбоев, мне это было важно. Отопление к сожалению, не работало, помещение отапливалось только обогревателем, но по моей просьбе мне сразу выдали второе одеяло, что несколько спасло ситуацию, все-таки в Португалии в феврале ночами холодно, да еще каждый день шел дождь. И нужно иметь в виду, что подача горячей воды в душе осуществляется с помощью водонагревателя, и провести в душе целый час не получится, потребуется время для нового нагрева. Не знаю, сколько было всего постояльцев в отеле, но шума не было, и улица вечером абсолютно тихая, можно  хорошо выспаться после многочисленных прогулок по Порту. Отель оставил очень хорошее впечатление, особенно мгновенным реагированием на просьбы, спасибо Марио. Хотя я не говорю на португальском и всего пару слов знаю на английском, с помощью интернет-переводчика мы хорошо понимали друг друга. Ресепшен здесь не круглосуточный, и у вас будут ключи от комнаты и от входной двери в отель, но в назначенную дату вас будут ждать, просто сообщите отелю подробности о времени своего приезда. Очень удачное расположение отеля: совсем рядом есть магазин продуктов со всем необходимым, но самое главное, отель недалеко от вокзала, и очень удобно ездить по соседним городам на осмотр достопримечательностей. От вокзала часть пути идти в крутую горку до отеля, но ведь это Порту, здесь все улицы такие. До отеля легко добраться на метро из аэропорта: на станции Trindade нужно сделать пересадку на другую линию и доехать до станции Sao Bento, поездка займет примерно час. Очень хорошее соотношение цены номера и качества. В следующую поездку в Порту я поселюсь именно здесь."},{"_id":"12801139","date":{"$date":"2014-05-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1726242","reviewer_id":"7949198","reviewer_name":"Brian","comments":"My stay in Porto was great thanks to the nice studio that I stayed in.

And it's so close the metro station as well. \r\n\r\nMario and the others at By Clerigos Studios were very welcoming.They marked out many of the best attractions on my map and even left me a little bottle of port to enjoy. Mario kindly offered me extra towels and an additional heater if I wanted. \r\n\r\nThe apartment itself is a good little nest for one person. It's tiny, but I liked that - it's a cozy space at the end of the day. It is a fair bit darker than the pictures though and there's not a lot of privacy if your windows are open - it's a direct view into the apartment across the street. The bed is comfy and there are a variety of appliances provided - even a blender for smoothies!\r\n\r\nMy biggest issue was with the bathroom - the drainage in the shower is very slow, which would leave me ankle deep in water towards the end of my shower! And the bathroom fan either didn't work or wasn't effective, because the steam just didn't dissipate. \r\n\r\nNonetheless, I enjoyed my stay here and this is a pretty good choice if you're on a budget and want to spend some time in Porto."},{"_id":"61972480","date":{"$date":"2016-02-10T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1726242","reviewer_id":"8914808","reviewer_name":"Dina","comments":"Do appreciate Rafaela being there to greet me.

I had a lot of issues unfortunately! First of all the entire apartment building is a hotel kinda thing that Mario runs. Every apartment has been posted on different websites. When you arrive Mario or his friends always are there to greet you and show you your place and things around Porto. THE location is great as it's central to everything but it gets extremely loud in the night as there is a pop bar right outside. The apartment is on a side street and so the rooms get really hot. I asked for a fan but was immediately denied. I actually fell sick and got heat rashes during my stay. It was unbearable...and a little bit of a put off. I requested twice for a fan but was told it's fresh in the nights but no part of the nights were fresh. I used to keep the windows open but the music from the bar would be so loud that I couldn't sleep. The bathroom shower would fill up fast and couldn't drain the water fast enough. The room was definitely neat and clean and had all amenities but I wouldn't live here again especially not with the attitude Mario had."},{"_id":"83322872","date":{"$date":"2016-07-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1726242","reviewer_id":"2383406","reviewer_name":"Kathryn","comments":"Mario's place was perfect for my stay in Porto.

Big ups for Mario's flexibility.\n\nThe apartment was perfect for a one-night stay alone, and the bed is actually tall-people-friendly and super comfy! I wouldn't stay here for much longer, if I had plans to spend any time at home or if I came with a friend, because space is extremely limited and no one would fit next to me on the narrow bed.\n\nHowever, the street and the wider area the place is in is absolutely dreamy and if you only need the place at night to sleep, while enjoying the streets of Porto by day and in the evening, this place is right for you.\n\n"},{"_id":"150501609","date":{"$date":"2017-05-08T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1726242","reviewer_id":"28800933","reviewer_name":"Eddy","comments":"Excellent location, hulpfull host."},{"_id":"150944602","date":{"$date":"2017-05-10T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1726242","reviewer_id":"62909929","reviewer_name":"Mustapha","comments":"Un appartement bien situé et bien lumineux  nous avons passé un bon séjour à Porto ."},{"_id":"151139788","date":{"$date":"2017-05-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1726242","reviewer_id":"14526304","reviewer_name":"Virginie","comments":"super reactivité et tres accueillant ! logement en parfait accord avec la description"},{"_id":"151731362","date":{"$date":"2017-05-14T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1726242","reviewer_id":"894629","reviewer_name":"Hillary","comments":"Excellent location, very clean, easy check in and out, Mario was easy to communicate with.

Luckily he was inside, and tried to open the door but he too cannot open it from the inside and outside (used the window to get out). He then yelled at me and accused me for not using the correct key when in fact the other key provided (key to our room) would not fit in the keyhole so how can i use it? He then started trying to break the doorkey lock. Even the customers at a nearby resto helped opening the door but to no avail. He then sent a message that a guest broke the doorkey lock which I didnt. I merely tried to open the door using the key provided to us. He didnt even help us get inside the apartment (so we could eat and rest, we were very tired) and let us wait outside. He just told us that if we want to get inside we just have to climb through the window so we had to do our own initiative of borrowing chair from nearby resto so we (and otherguests) can get inside.

This place is the stuff AirBnB dreams are made of. \n\nThe peaceful vibe throughout the Harlem Flophouse was a welcome respite from a chaotic week of trip planning. We arrived with just enough time to get ready and make a show we had tickets for, but I would have been happy to have dropped our bags and wandered around the house.\n\nThe room was much bigger than I expected, with beautiful polished wood floors and large windows that allowed the natural light to showcase all of the interesting and quirky details that made this place so memorable. \n\nMy favorite little detail (that I never would have noticed had René not pointed it out) were the cigarette burn marks in the wood mantle over the decorative fireplace-remnants of the house's rich history, lovingly and respectfully preserved.\n\nAs far as the actual logistics, we left our car in a garage just around the corner. The subway was a short walk away, and a quick ride into Times Square. The bed was super comfy (oh god, the comforter!). The bathroom was beautiful, with a claw foot tub and incredible water pressure (there's another cool little detail in the ceiling above the toilet-don't forget to look!). There's also an additional sink in the room, which is great. René was easy to get in touch with and very responsive. Oh, one thing to note- if you're a lover of makeup, bring a little travel mirror and take advantage of the light by the windows.\n\nAt the risk of sounding like the most touristy tourist ever, it was great to feel like we were getting a taste of the \"real\" New York City, without the flashy corporate packaging of the \"Times Square Experience.\"\n\nAnyway, we loved it, and will certainly be back. Thanks for a great stay, René!\n\n"},{"_id":"146696657","date":{"$date":"2017-04-23T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17263550","reviewer_id":"34578156","reviewer_name":"Emily","comments":"René has a gorgeous home.

The common areas are gorgeous, the room is spacious and well-decorated and comfortable. René was a great host; not much interaction with him (but we like to just do our own thing, generally) but he was very friendly and accommodating. Check-in was a breeze and we even had help from his friendly cat Phoebe.\n\nNote that this is a heritage building with mostly period decor and amenities. We had no issues whatsoever with this, but others may be looking for something more modern. Temperature control, for instance, may be an issue for some. We were there during a cool, rainy week so it was not an issue but it seemed like the 3rd-floor room might be a bit hot in the heat of summer. Can't be sure, though.\n\nI've stayed in close to half a dozen NYC airbnbs now, and this was the closest I've been to the subway. The nearest station is just a 2-minute walk away and the A, B, C, and D trains stop there. The next nearest is a 5-minute walk away and the 2 and 3 trains stop there. Plus, if you're considering using the M60 bus to/from LaGuardia, it stops at the aforementioned stations as well. You are very connected to all of Manhattan and NYC in general at this location, despite not being anywhere near midtown or lower Manhattan.\n\nAs for proximity to food/nightlife/sightseeing, we didn't check out much in the area since we had visited Harlem before and checked out some other stuff around NYC instead. That said, we grabbed breakfast at Bo's Bagels on nearby 116th st. every morning (highly recommended!) and there seemed to be a number of other dining options around there. And there is certainly fun and food to be had in the greater Harlem area.\n\nWe felt relatively safe in the neighbourhood and had no trouble. Ignore what you hear about Harlem's reputation esp. from those who haven't been to NY in years (or at all). Although 125th st. is often filled with activity (and not all of it on the up-and-up) at all hours of the night, the rest of the area is just a residential neighbourhood, full of families and people of all ages just going about their lives. I mean, as with anywhere you're thinking of staying in a city like NY, do your research and make sure that the area is for you.\n\nOverall, if you want a historic Harlem/New York experience, you simply must check this place out, but be aware of what is offered and what you're looking for in a stay."},{"_id":"159077047","date":{"$date":"2017-06-09T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17263550","reviewer_id":"1416887","reviewer_name":"Adrienne","comments":"What an amazing home Rene has!

On the mantle in our bedroom was an array of antique porcelain and tin banks. The largest of these, right next to a pink chihuahua in a wig, was a blackface/Pickaninny bank (a black face with a cartoonish expression and bright red lips, ready to lift coins into his mouth by a mechanical hand). Downstairs in the common room were multiple objects depicting black boys with watermelons.

The neighborhood is quiet at night and the house is a classic Brownstone.  The bedrooms are generous in size, uniquely furnished and the mattress and pillows very good.  The house exudes its historic character and you feel as tough you are transported to the 1920s or 30s.  Steps creak, soft jazz plays in the reception area and the bathrooms are generous in size.  For subway riders, the stop is less than three blocks away and it is an easy trip down Manhattan on either the local or express trains.  Not too many restaurants in the immediate vicinity but several in walking distance. Great music nearby.  I felt very safe walking the area at night and in the day.  Whole Foods Market is nearby.  For an eclectic and off-beat experience, I recommend this location.   My only request is that the room would benefit from an easy chair in place of one of the two straight-back chairs.  I would stay here again when traveling to New York City."},{"_id":"219480842","date":{"$date":"2017-12-17T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17263550","reviewer_id":"119094490","reviewer_name":"Mary","comments":"We had an amazing trip and our stay here was perfect!

La maison est décorée avec beaucoup de personnalité, et la chambre en elle-même est très sympathique. Située au deuxième étage, nous avons disposé d'une salle de bain parfaitement fonctionnelle.  Nous avons beaucoup apprécié la présence d'une radio et de serviettes de toilettes dans la chambre."},{"_id":"254652765","date":{"$date":"2018-04-17T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17263550","reviewer_id":"64554027","reviewer_name":"Hi","comments":"The home was beautiful, clean and everything went well.

The room is huge! I loved exploring Harlem and eating some good food at Sylvia’s just a short walk away  The subway is close so it was quick to get downtown when we wanted. Last time I stayed in Manhattan, I stayed in a hotel room that barely had walking room to get around the bed. Our room was clean and spacious. It’s lovely to go to NY in April before it gets too hot out. All the details of the house are just fantastic. Little treasures to be seen in many books. Very fun. Gave the whole trip a special kind of feel."},{"_id":"271875164","date":{"$date":"2018-06-02T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17263550","reviewer_id":"63834157","reviewer_name":"Reasha","comments":"This is a beautiful Airbnb! I stayed in two different rooms during my stay and each is unique and spacious. The whole place is extremely clean. The shower has great water pressure and the bathtub is lovely if you decide to take a bath. Harlem is a fun neighborhood (go eat at Red Rooster) and Réne even sent out emails with weekly events around town. Very close to the subway, a 24 hour grocery and a Pilates studio if you wanna sneak in a workout. The jazz playing when you come in the door is a nice touch.

The hosts are quick to respond and helpful and even helped me take my suitcases down the stairs during a checkout (which they also let me do late).

Towels were nice and fluffy, and plenty of hot water, but there were no plants at all - unlike in the photos, and there was even a dead one in a cracked old pot in one bedroom that hadn't been removed, and was taking up valuable space. The light switches were brown with grime, one of the bathroom lights flickered constantly, and continual static from the bedside light meant we didn't use it. No comforter was provided for the extra bed, despite my request in advance for bedding. And the fridge, which is in the other sleeping area was extremely noisy. Basically, with a little bit of investment, this could be a really great rental.

If you wanna stay in the city, maybe you should look for something else. But if you enjoy walking and a little hiking, this is not bad. And it’s reasonably priced. It’s a very nice house too. Think of an American townhouse.\n\nMichelle isn’t there. Her husband lives there with you. You get a room on the 2nd floor in a 3 story house. Mind you he always sleeps on the couch in the living area right next to your room, out of all the rooms that are there. You have to share the restroom. He is very sensitive. You have to snoop around the house or he’s shouting at you. \nOne time I came home late very early in the morning and \nI was up 2am or 3am one time and I went to the kitchen and heated up some leftover food -got hungry from all the walking and touring -and ate it in the dining room, he came downstairs and said something. because he’s not in a room but in the living room, he could hear everything. \n\nIt doesn’t mention that you can’t eat or drink food in your room at all. Only in the dining room. \nHis English is not good, so it’s hard to understand him. And he’s very bossy.\n\nThis is a good place if you are just gonna sleep there and leave. It has a good price for what you get. And if you prefer a remote area."}]}

But still super easy to cook and the kitchenware was all in a really good clean state. All in all the apartment was lovely, clean and comfortable! And well located in terms of public transport!"},{"_id":"292866510","date":{"$date":"2018-07-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17296538","reviewer_id":"192578817","reviewer_name":"Cristhian","comments":"Todo estuvo bien"},{"_id":"313369376","date":{"$date":"2018-08-25T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17296538","reviewer_id":"40462294","reviewer_name":"Tamer","comments":"can recommend. everything was perfect"},{"_id":"325330117","date":{"$date":"2018-09-19T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17296538","reviewer_id":"35463786","reviewer_name":"Paul","comments":"demander des torchons des produits lave linge et demander de réduire les frais de ménages ou du moins ne pas sortir les poubelles pour de frais de ménages exorbitants \ndes murs ont besoin d’être rafraichis"}]}

The same can be said for the host Vitor, who does everything he can to make the stay comfortable.

Ma il fatto che manchi il riscaldamento e che il sole non ci arrivi mai provoca, oltre al freddo (sei coperte necessarie sul letto in giornate dal clima primaverile), una grande umidità: tornato in Italia, il pigiama che avevo usato odorava di umido. Quando sono arrivato la camera non era pronta, e lampadine fulminate non erano state sostituite.

Gaia is a very nice and accommodating host. She was very flexible about our check-in time (for which I was very grateful) and very helpful with any information we needed (about the area, public transportation, finding our way around the apartment, etc.). She also always immediately replied to and assisted with all our questions. The room we stayed in was very cozy and clean, and had a little balcony. Our room had a curtain, instead of a door, which was however no problem, because we had the place to ourselves, which felt luxurious! The whole apartment is very nicely done up. We could use the kitchen and Gaia put out coffee and tea for us. The apartment is also very conveniently located and the busses and metro get you to the city in no time. Astoria is a cool place to live. There are many good restaurants, coffeeshops etc., as well as a nice park with view on Manhattan, only minutes away from the apartment.

The room is bigger than a standard hotel room which makes packing and movement easier. The balcony is a huge plus. I'll miss taking my morning coffee there.\nThe bed is something else. The most comfortable bed I've slept in. After walking for hours, it's so nice looking forward to that cushy mattress at the end of the day. \nAstoria is a great place to stay when in NYC without costing you an arm and a leg. Lots of good restaurants and bars around on days you want to stay in the neighbourhood. It's a few stops from Manhattan and trains and buses are frequent. \nGaia is quick to respond to questions, the building is in a quiet corner. All in all, good experience.

Safe area, had the place to myself for almost the entire 2 weeks, and the room is beautiful (has such great energy!) The only thing I would say which was tricky was that the room has no door, just a curtain which does keep the AC in nicely but does not provide a lot of privacy. It was my oversight as it was mentioned in the listing but I think if there’s no door this listing should be listed as a shared space. With that said, Gaia made me feel so welcome and she was super responsive, like when the WiFi went down or the closest subway stop shut down and I needed to find an alternative route to school in Manhattan ( (Hidden by Airbnb) Maps wasn’t helping!) I would recommend this space for a single traveler/student. I loved this wonderful and peaceful time in Queens, thanks Gaia!

I was in town for a work trip and booked a few extra days for myself - it was the perfect spot for a solo traveller, and definitely the best place I’ve stayed in New York.  The loft is beautiful and I loved the area - away from the intensity of Manhattan but with plenty to do and easily accessible. The loft’s guidebook has loads of local recommendations to explore.\n\nMarcella was a lovely, warm host and provided all the info I needed. Be aware, it’s a tranquil space, so they are quite strict on noise and conversations at night and before 10am in the morning. The disclaimer is true - probably not the place to stay if you want to stay in drinking or if you’re on a group trip, but then again, it’s New York so you should probably be out experiencing the city anyway! Definitely recommend this place if you want to stay somewhere fun but peaceful."},{"_id":"253943163","date":{"$date":"2018-04-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17311213","reviewer_id":"17726844","reviewer_name":"Kamron","comments":"Great place for anyone looking for a cozy, affordable, tasteful place to rest when visiting New York!

I booked and communication about check-in and to address any concerns were almost immediately addressed. I was late for my check-in and tried to give as much notification about my ETA but NYC traffic was congested with many accidents that day. Be mindful, the hosts have to be home to check you in so try to pick a check-in time when you are sure you can be there. Despite my late arrival, they were very accommodating and I felt welcomed. I stayed in one room and mostly had the place to myself. I had never been in a shared Airbnb space but this one definitely set the bar high. The other guests were quiet and clean. Every inch of the home was photographable and well thought out. My only gripe was there were ants in the bedroom which I figured had to do with it being summertime. Given my schedule, I was not able to immediately notify Marcella and Tiffany about the ants. I enjoyed having breakfast tea in the morning and check-out easily. Overall, this was a great experience and I will definitely look into booking this place again.

Marcella seemed to play 'bad cop' to Tiffany's 'good cop' (other host, who lives there).  There seemed to be a long list of rules that weren't clear, and we weren't difficult or rule breaking guests at all, we incorrectly ate something out of the fridge and apologised and replaced with the exact products once we realised our mistake. \n\nMy 16 year old son started to climb the fire escape ladder outside the building (no, perhaps not the best move, but not meant to disrupt) and set of an alert to the host who then sent an officious and quite unpleasant message - saying it was against the rules set out somewhere that I never saw. I of course apologised, but it was the way Marcella communicated that really made us feel uncomfortable for the rest of our stay. \n\nIf you want butter on your toast as part of the supplied breakfast you'll need to buy your own. Kindly they supply cereal and bread and jam, milk and tea/coffee but strangely no butter. I asked kindly where it was and was told that in the USA it's not normal to have butter on your toast and they can't be expected to cater for weird customs of people from other cultures. Really? \n\nI think we were polite and cleaned up after ourselves and behaved nicely, but on the last morning at 8.05am I used the hairdryer in the bathroom and was reprimanded for being 'noisy' in 'quiet time'. Really? Most people on holiday want to be able to use a hairdryer during 'normal' waking hours. Perhaps the hosts should supply a quieter, higher quality dryer. \n\nHonestly the place looks super cute and is wonderfully eclectically styled but it is impractical - nowhere to hang clothes, no room for full sized suitcases in room, only one bedside table on each double bed and strangely pictures are hung on the walls behind the pillows - looks nice but when you sit up in bed you lean on a picture. We all found, and the other American guests who we met (the best part of our stay) did too, that there was a distinct lack of sincerity from the hosts, and to be honest did not feel particularly welcome. One of our party left before the 3 nights were up and we wished we hadn't made the booking. It felt all about the business/$$$ and not about warm and kind homey hosting and values.\n"},{"_id":"294823164","date":{"$date":"2018-07-22T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17311213","reviewer_id":"37154242","reviewer_name":"Deborah","comments":"The space is exactly as pictured.

Marcella was traveling, so I was very well received by Tiffany who is a very kind, caring and interesting person. The only negatives were the proximity of the rooms without noise insulation and only have a single bathroom for everyone at the loft (which can reach six people with full house).

Though the room is small, it's got everything you might need – a place to hang your clothes, room to store your luggage, a small table and chair, and a comfy bed with ample space for items you might need nearby at night (water or a book). Their place is conveniently located a few blocks from the M and J subway lines, making travel into the city easy. The breakfast in the morning is simple but nice to have if you want to have a small bite while planning your day. Can't think of anything that needs improvement, and I hope to stay here again!"},{"_id":"350594399","date":{"$date":"2018-11-19T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17311213","reviewer_id":"60383124","reviewer_name":"Jeannette","comments":"Marcella \u0026 Britna were incredible! From the start, communication was incredibly strong and responsive with each of them and they went above and beyond to ensure that any questions I may have had were answered.\n\nTheir home is absolutely gorgeous, sparkling clean, and so conveniently located to many of Bushwick’s charming locations! I planned my stay around a concert I attended at the venue Elsewhere, which was a brief 20 minute walk away. \n\nThe neighborhood has plenty of local shops and restaurants, and their loft is a quick walk from the Myrtle Avenue subway station. \n\nBritna greeted me and did a really wonderful job of making me feel right at home and welcomed. I only stayed for one night, but their home was adorably decorated and a dream loft, especially for any artist! The details in all their styling were beautiful and they provided  breakfast and great local tips. The value of this Airbnb is beyond incredible! And staying while other guests were present was a really cool experience! I couldn’t have asked for a better stay!

There are several public transportation options like the Subway J line and M line- I think the M line (stop Central Av) was definitely the closest. Just a few minutes walking from the station to the loft. There are plenty of options for food and grocery stores in walking distance from the loft.  \n\nCheck in + Hosts: \nThe check-in was very smoothly and Marcella explained everything in full, giving me the grand tour of the loft, explaining everything well and showing me the big book of information. This book has all the essential information about the loft (address, entrance code- currently the loft works with a code and not with keys) and other important information. Also you can find great hotspot and restaurant reviews, where to go to for medical assistance if needed, how to get around in Brooklyn etc. It is a very well organised book full of information. If you have any other questions both Marcella and Maya are there to help you. I have had the pleasure to meet them both and they are just cool chicks who are super kind and will do their best to make you feel at home.\n\nThe loft:\nThe loft has 3 rooms that are available for guests. I have stayed in the 'single room' - a very pretty decorated room with colored skylights and a 1 pers. bed. The bed was lifted so you could put your suitcases under the bed if needed, there was a mirror, perfect to do your hair + make up, a heater (as is in all the rooms as I understood) and a decorative small table and chair. When I read previous reviews I read that the room was 'quite small' - but I was actually surprised by the size and it was bigger than I thought. Yes, it is not the big or biggest room in the loft but when you are traveling solo it is more than enough. You are out most of the days anyways and if you want to hang in a 'bigger space' just enjoy the swing or very comfy couch. Oh, and the bed in the room was very comfy as well, the bedding was super clean and the room was very clean when I arrived too.\n\nCool features: \nIt is perfect to take tons of pictures. The swing is a big eye catcher but also the cool colored kitchen with blue cabinets (at the time I'm writing this, not sure it will change in the future) the big red coca cola fridge and even a piano. The loft is so creatively decorated and is just a fun place to be where you immediately will feel at home.\n\nOther things worth mentioning + overall opinion.\nThe bathroom is being kept very clean too and the kitschy wallpaper and design is just fun. Currently, there is a breakfast being served between 7 AM - 11 AM. As they mention themselves it is 'pretty basic' but in all honesty, Airbnb hosts don't even have to provide you with anything so this is just a cool extra. When I was staying there, there were 2 options of cereal (jummy!) and oats to make oatmeal (if I remember correctly). It is nice that when you wake up you can have a nice bowl of cereal with your cup of tea (tea is also offered for guests so you can make your own cup in the morning to enjoy while swinging on the swing or relaxing on the couch :))\n\nI loved the loft. It was a very nice experience and both hosts were super kind. It is everything I expected and more and I will definitely book the loft again if I have the chance in the future.  Also, maybe important for those that want to know: The WiFi works super fast and perefctly in each part of the loft. So when it is rainy and you want to Netflix that is definitely not a problem.\n\nAgain, just book it! Just do it! You won't regret it!"},{"_id":"410625763","date":{"$date":"2019-02-10T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17311213","reviewer_id":"28922249","reviewer_name":"Christian","comments":"Stylish, roomy and good location for solo traveler.

It is also fully equipped for basically anything you might want to do during your stay, including cooking and washing clothes. Marta received us with tips and a much appreciated bottle of Portuguese wine, and she also told us we could listen to her CD collection, which we did because she happens to have good taste for music, too. The apartment is located in a residential area, with a supermarket, a drugstore and a few local restaurants and cafés nearby. The supermarket, in particular, is very closely located, and a short walk will take you to the nearest metro station. The neighborhood is very calm and silent: the nearby church bells tolls between 7 AM and 10 PM, but during the silent hours sleep quality is excellent. The bed was also unusually good and comfortable.

We would definitely stay here again."},{"_id":"121250020","date":{"$date":"2016-12-15T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1731365","reviewer_id":"23887632","reviewer_name":"Jennifer","comments":"This apartment is perfect for two couples.

Quiet enough that I did not need my earplugs, which I required every night during a previous stay in a louder part of town. Central Park is just at the end of the block. We loved walking around the park and seeing all the sights within, eventually ending up at the Met. For any fellow runners, the street is directly adjacent to the reservoir jogging loop. The kitchen appeared to be fully equipped, although we didn’t cook (because vacation). The fridge kept our drinks cold and had an ice and water dispenser in the door. Most importantly, this place was clean and we always felt safe there. Francesca checked in on us here and there to make sure everything was satisfactory and to offer suggestions for things to do, and she and Jack were always easy to reach. We had a light bulb blow in one of the bathrooms and they replaced it right away. This place has so much charm and historical detail.

The kitchen, though small, is well-equipped and the front-facing dining room is a lovely place for a quick snack or more leisurely meal. \nStrong wifi, easy access to supermarkets, including Trader Joe’s and Whole Foods, and a range of public transportation options add to the charm and convenience of the apartment. Francesca and Jack were available, occasionally in person, always via email, to respond to questions and concerns. As frequent AirBnB’ers, we have a strong basis for comparison and this duplex apartment, with it’s wonderful back garden, ranks high on our list of favorites."},{"_id":"289175287","date":{"$date":"2018-07-11T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1731365","reviewer_id":"3929920","reviewer_name":"Trienet","comments":"Francesca's place is extremely spacious and filled with beautiful antiques.

The bed and linen are very nice. The TV programs are nostalgically attractive. The host Francesca is very responsive to all my questions, who sent a co-host even to help me out, which I appreciate a lot. The house is very clean and is stylish as seen on the pictures, but the shining pictures on the website are misleading, the house is actually much darker, gloomy I'd say, I even feared going upstairs at night, and the conditions of the house are a bit disappointing, the water closets are very loud while flushing which seem to last forever, each time you have to summon your courage to push the button, has suggested Francesca replace them; the heating devices on the wall are kinka noisy as well; the stairs are uneven and creak, the living-room sofas must have endured time and cave in when you sit on it. The host's hospitality makes up for the defects of the house, complicated feelings, the cohost once brought her talented son to play us two wonderful pieces on the piano.  Hopefully, the house can be renovated to do justice to the features and the advantage of the location it is blessed with."},{"_id":"419324869","date":{"$date":"2019-03-03T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"1731365","reviewer_id":"775803","reviewer_name":"Rebecca \u0026 Rob","comments":"If you get the opportunity to stay in this luxurious apartment on the upper West side don’t miss it!\nA very spacious and comfortable apartment; well located and well appointed as far as bedding and towels being top notch; great showers and everything you might need was at our fingertips. \nWe had fun regrouping in the lavish parlor both morning and night.  \nThe lovely private garden is such a rare treat as well.   \nGroceries, food, spirits, drug stores, subway, museums, restaurants and good live music are within easy walking distance.  \nThis apartment is one of a kind and we thought it was fantastic!   \nIt’s important to note that Francesca is a Superior hostess as well! :-)"}]}

I stayed here with my 3 kids for 15 nights. My first night at the Airbnb I noticed that the air mattress was filthy and the sheets on the beds smelled sweaty and were old. The fitted sheet on the bed had a big hole in it too and the elastic was so stretched out that it would not stay on the bed. I messaged Irisha and she brought \"new\" sheets the next morning. The \"new\" sheets were in the same conditions as the last ones and had the same smell. The same day while my daughter was getting dressed she noticed a man standing outside of the bedroom window, the curtains are so sheer and pulled back that anyone can see inside. I had to put sheets on the windows so we could get dressed. I messaged Irisha because I had no idea that other people were at the house and she said \" we live at the residence \". I woke up at 7:30 the next morning because of a small child crying, running, around and screaming, also throughout the day I could hear people talking loudly. I was woken up everyday at 7 from the noise. And at late hours of the night I could hear people stomping, I have recording of this. The next night my son was sick with a virus and he had pink eye, I had to give him eyedrops at midnight after we had returned from the hospital. He has never had pink eye before so he cried when I put the drops in his eye. I immediately got a message from Irisha saying that I was being disrespectful and to keep down the noise. Mind you there are no rules for Airbnb guests for noise in this place and it is listed as family friendly. It is so hypocritical that I am condemned for making noise when it is hard for my family to go to sleep because of the noise and we were woken up early too every morning. The next day I saw Irisha outside with her children she did not say hello to me I had to approach her myself and we discussed her message. I was asking her the rules of staying in her place and the situation with her gate because its hard to close. She said to me that its okay if its open because the neighborhood is safe because no black people live here. She then said that she has one black neighbor named Mohammad and whenever she sees a black man she knows its him and she feels safe. My daughter and her two friends heard her say this too. We are a Latino family and my son is half black I felt discriminated against and unwanted. It was a big shock that someone would say that.

Here are some of our comments:\n\n1.  No lights were on in front of the house so we could see the house number...\nwe had to walk up and down the sidewalk to find to the correct house.\n\n2.  Once we found the house ... we then had to go to back of the house\nthru a gate again, it was dark and we couldn't see ... so, we had to\nuse our cellphone flash lights to find our way into the back of the house.\nOnce we got thru the gate it was hard opening the key box. There's a light above the door but is very dim and needs to be brighter. \n\n3.  The grass in the back yard and front yard were overgrown and we couldn't\nbelieve how bad it looked.  The back yard had toys and trash all over the place ... we can't believe that someone couldn't take the time to make the front/back yard look good.  Keep in mind that the rest of the neighborhood had good looking yards.\n\n4. Once we finally got inside the house we couldn't believe there\nwasn't two bedrooms. There is only one bedroom with a bed box spring and\nmattress sitting on the floor (no bed frame). The other room has the hard and uncomfortable sofa bed which also includes a small table with the coffee pot and other coffee related products. The other couple decided not to stay there either night after seeing this place. \n\n5.  The curtains on the windows were see thru ... if someone was\noutside they could see in the rooms ... (we couldn't believe this)\nsad!!! We put a sheet on one window and the air mattress on the other window for privacy.\n\n6.  Everything in the rooms were very old, worn out and out dated to\ninclude the comforter, sheets, blankets, pillows and pillow cases. It was\nclean but very old and worn.The comforter on the queen size bed was full size therefore it didn't fit appropriately.\n\n7. With the money that you're get from renting this place out; there\nshould not be very dated and worn out sheets, towels, pillows. etc...\n\n8. Until improvements are completed we don't recommend this place to\nno one and I will post this comment online.\n\n9. Fix this place up and I'll change my comment  ... We were hoping to\nhave a  place to come to when we visit our family in NYC but\nunfortunately we won't be coming back. As a matter of a fact we only\nspent Friday night there.  Saturday night we went elsewhere.\nMy brother and his wife didn't spend one night there based on what\nthey saw when we arrived on Friday evening.\n\n10. The shower has mold in the shower grout. \n\n11. The space didn't have a TV or radio available either.\n\n12. This place should be removed from the Airbnb list.\n\n13. 1st impressions are lasting impressions.\n\nI've attached some photos that I took while we were there. The man in\nthe pic is my husband (Richard)\n\nRichard and Sandy Jones"},{"_id":"342806046","date":{"$date":"2018-10-29T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17319360","reviewer_id":"64629324","reviewer_name":"Luis","comments":"good place located in a quite neighborhood. good value."},{"_id":"365680694","date":{"$date":"2019-01-01T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17319360","reviewer_id":"217282786","reviewer_name":"Ashley","comments":"Nice space,  lots of close by good options and easy to get on public transport.

It is located in one of Manhattan's more exciting neighborhoods and surrounded by great night life.  The unfortunate trade off is the noise - while a few floors up, street level sounds still certainly make it through the windows.  \n\nThere are thick curtains to help ameliorate and I came in prepared with ear plugs just in case (ended up not needing them).  A few relics of the age of the building remains in the faucets/knobs in the bathroom, but everything is entirely functioning and nothing a little bit of wiggling cannot solve.\n\nAnnie was generous and kind, leaving us a bottle of Prosseco and birthday candles for my partner.

There is a climb up, down, then back up the stairs to get it all unlocked but that's pretty reasonable since it's security. The interior is very charming and warm and definitely feels like a place someone lives. Right outside your door is everything. Anytime I wanted to go somewhere specifically it was always \"right on this street\". The place was cozy, neighbors were super quiet (the street is noisy but it's right on a busy street), and the neighborhood was in fact amazing. \n\nAnnie herself was very responsive to bigger and smaller questions from getting in to what sort of soap she had in the bathroom (because it smelled amazing). She was incredibly accommodating on us checking in and out and responded quickly that it felt like we were staying at a friends place rather than just a stranger. \n\nThe place was cheap (relative to Manhattan) too, and it would be well worth it if it was more as well. Definitely a good stay if you want to have a good time in the city."},{"_id":"337224916","date":{"$date":"2018-10-15T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17326116","reviewer_id":"57953217","reviewer_name":"Andrea","comments":"Had a great time and enjoyed the space!!

This was the same price and we did not have to  basically restock a dorm room for 12 weeks, there was wireless, and it was  exceptionally clean. (The bathroom is amazing.)  I had a million questions as we were making the decision and Shane answered every single one, promptly.  Julia was safe and secure, she met some amazing people this summer at the Air B N B and her life was enriched.  The internship required her to leave as early as 3:45 am and occasionally return very late at night.  There were no safety issues.

Really close to two trains and in a nice and safe area. Keep in mind that new York apartments aren't big, but the room is big enough if you travel by yourself. The room is layed out that you have enough space for your stuff and the closet is also spacious.\nWhat I absolutely loved about this apartment is how clean and well organised it was and the location of this apartment. I was traveling alone as a woman and I didn't feel unsafe once! \nYou share the apartment in total with 3 other rooms but you really don't notice it. Everyone is really respectful towards each other and also you don't hear a lot. The room is located at the street side, so if you're a light sleeper keep this in mind, because you're in New York! They do provide ear plugs for you if you want.\nColin lives in the apartment but you never see him, because of the self check in you can easily let yourself in and if you need anything you can just email one of the guys and they'll help you really quickly. If you're looking for more interaction with your airbnb hosts this might not be the apartment for you.\nAnyways I would highly highly recommend it to anyone and I was really sad to leave.

Francisca had fruit, bottle water, and juice waiting for me when I arrived (she even offered me dinner)! She gave advice on how to get around and answered questions regarding the area. The house is spotless. The room is located in the basement and a living room, dining area, bathroom, and kitchen are shared with another bedroom that is also used for Airbnb. 1 block from a laundromat, 3 blocks from the A train (takes about an hour to Manhattan), 3 blocks from the beach, and a 7 minute walk to St. John's Hospital, CVS, Grocery store, Dunkin' Donuts, and subway. I walked home from the hospital at all hours of the night and never felt unsafe. The area is well lit and there is plenty of street parking available if you decide to bring a car.

The location is by the beach. You will have no concerns getting to this property you must  take the train system(A train)  and will get you to this location in no problem. It is by the airport jfk. I was coming from Newark Liberty international, and I followed the directions to get the A train. It took around 1 hour for me. Once  I arrived I was immediately greeted with food by Francisca . Francisca is very delightful she  prepared food for me multiple times despite her busy schedule and I was able to eat. She would leave fresh food on the table for me, and I would come back to see a plate of food which was nice. She showed me  the whole apartment and I was happy to see how  bigger it is than in the pictures. Very spacious with a lovely clean bathroom you will be more than happy to see it is big and clean, not  like a small box as in other New York accommodations. I was lucky because she made me feel very comfortable in such a big space and I settled in quickly. Food options\nThere is key food 5 minutes work \nDeli stores ( all over which is excellent)\nCvs 5 minutes walk \nDunkin doughnuts 5 minutes walk \nBasking and Robbin 5 minutes \nTrain station 5 minutes walk \nLaundrette that has a FREE drying service $4.75 to wash, it  is about 4 minutes  walk ( Fernando is your guy, he will assist with your laundry. I recommend tipping him as well as he will wash and dry your clothes for you if you want) \nThe area is by the beach, after having a stressful day in the city I would go to the beach and just relax.\n\nIt is a quiet area, all people within the area are polite. There is a strong diverse community so really you can eat a variety of foods. My favourite place to eat was Yumze Gourmet Deli and Smoothie and also a deli stores just opposite the station R\u0026R. Fresh food, the owners are  down to earth man. I enjoyed my stay and will be coming back when I’m next in New York .

We really appreciated that they did not give up, but we were quite disappointed in the beginning because we could not properly rest, we have a 3 year old child who would have needed an afernoon nap which was impossible. However, Alexandra did understand our problem and made a generous offer to give us one week stay for free next year to compensate. Our experience was therefore rather mixed.

Además de eso, hay un supermercado \"Pingo Doce\" a apenas 300 metros. Por la noche, para dormir, es muy tranquilo ya que no hay tráfico.\n\nNos recibió Alexandre que esperó pacientemente a que llegáramos algo más tarde de lo previsto. Todo hospitalidad (habla español también) con la explicación referente al apartamento en sí y a la zona. Además, me llamó cada día de nuestra escapada a Oporto para preguntar si estaba todo bien o necesitábamos algo.\n\nEl apartamento está muy bien equipado en lo referente a la cocina (vajilla completa, horno, microondas, máquina de café, batidora, etc..) lo que te dá la posibilidad de preparar desayunos o comidas con comodidad. Tiene un dormitorio con una litera y una cama extra muy amplio, el de matrimonio tiene una cuna. Televisión de última generación (en el salón y las habitaciones). En general las fotos se corresponden con lo que nos encontramos, incluso las fotos no dan la impresión de lo \"grande\" que es el apartamento, \n\nHay pequeños detalles que mejorar (el sofá no es muy cómodo, eché en falta algún perchero, había una luz que fallaba...) y cosillas que estoy seguro que los anfitriones mejorarán porque no es difícil.\n\nPorto es una ciudad que enamora.

Gigi is helpful, but unintrusive - nice qualities in a host. As a quest you have access to the kitchen, living room and a large terrace. \n\nBreakfast is self-service, with several options provided - and you get a shelf in the fridge for you own use, so you can stock up additionally on whatever you like. \nThe rooms (3) are very small, basically the size of a double bed and 50cm on the sides, a clothes rack and some drawers. The bed is good quality (!) and not too soft. The window can be opened, its toward a quiet inner space. Nice if backpacking, or just wanting to have a quiet place to sleep (as we did), but good to be aware of. \nThe neighbourhood is residential, and there are supermercados around the corner for daily stuff. The area is some 5-10 mins metro ride (and a bit of walking) from the center - for us a good trade for the stillness compared of the loud drunk tourist infested city center."},{"_id":"159259637","date":{"$date":"2017-06-10T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17398623","reviewer_id":"127920424","reviewer_name":"Eduardo","comments":"Great place to stay while you're in Barcelona, their dog Flor is so loving and adorable"},{"_id":"160051930","date":{"$date":"2017-06-12T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17398623","reviewer_id":"133676396","reviewer_name":"Raul","comments":"Me encontre muy agusto.

Квартира просторная, сама комната очень маленькая, но этого более чем достаточно для короткого пребывания. Приятным бонусом с утра был завтрак.

There is also night bus that stops near by her place, which is very convenient. She also had a dog that is very friendly. So for those that are afraid of dogs, fret not, the dog doesn't bother you at all. Gigi also provide some snacks for breakfast, which is mainly bread and cupcakes.

It was above and beyond our expectations. If I could rate it, it would be an easy 10/10. This place was way better than a 5-star hotel. This was my first Airbnb experience and they have set the bar so high. From day one, George and Lucia had been nothing but helpful, attentive and on the ball of everything. There was so much thought given to every little detail of the house. The house was super clean and it always had an amazing scent. Fresh linen and towels were provided, and the bed was amazingly comfortable. The kitchen was fully equipped and everything needed to cook was there, including the recipe books. Commuting was rather easy. We took the train most of the time to travel to the city. The nearest train station is Kingsgrove Station which is about 10-15 minutes walking distance. Opal cards can be purchased from a convenience store at the station. We also downloaded the \"Opal Travel\" app to check on the train times and fare estimate. The nearest supermarket is Woolworths which is only 2 min walk from the train station. There are many restaurants around the train station too. This place has truly made us feel like home and there is absolutely nothing better than returning to a cozy house after a really long day in the city. George and Lucia were the best host we could ever ask for. We will definitely stay here again if we return to Sydney :)"},{"_id":"140578752","date":{"$date":"2017-03-30T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17438054","reviewer_id":"118265990","reviewer_name":"Mobin","comments":"George and Lucia's Granny Flat was a great place to stay.

This is so much more than the old granny flat of yesteryear. This flat is a place where anyone, even granny won't want to go home!\n\nIt is really clear that both George and Lucia really enjoy having their 'granny' visit, because the accomodation is astounding and was originally built to lodge her when she visits from abroad.\n\nYou arrive via a second, private and secluded entrance at the rear of the main home. The terraced entrance welcomes you and is a beautiful spot to dine alfresco of a morning or enjoy the native birds and a chilled glass of wine in the afternoon.\n\nThe kitchen is modern and well appointed. Stocked with all the essentials as if you were at home. We were welcomed with fresh bread, milk, fruit, chocolates and a bottle of bubbles for new years eve. This made such a welcome sight after having been travelling for the previous ten days and really couldn't be face the shops that late in the warmth of the afternoon.\n\nThe bedroom was appointed with plush linen, mountains of pillows to dissolve into, the design features, really made you feel like you have just stepped into a double page spread of an interior design magazine.\n\nAfter a weeks stay in the leafy suburb of Kingsgrove, we are leaving now as if we are new friends of the family.\n\nThank you for all the 'plus ones' George and Lucia, they have not gone unnoticed, and your family has really gone above and beyond what we thought was required.\n\nAs first time Air BnB users, you really have set the bar ridiculously high!\n\nWe look forward to coming back to Sydney to catch up again! Next time we'll supply the bubbles.\n\nxxx Sally, Dwayne and Mon"},{"_id":"227460205","date":{"$date":"2018-01-14T05:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17438054","reviewer_id":"162443879","reviewer_name":"Julie","comments":"A lovely spot, close to the airport with easy access to public transport.

The accommodation is of the highest quality in terms of furnishings, facilities and cleanliness. It was good to have our own entrance so we could come and go as we please.  George and Lucia have thought of everything you could need away from home including shopping bags, washing powder, toiletries and food cupboard staples such as cooking oil, herbs and pasta.  The welcome gift of a box of chocolates and a fridge stocked with milk and butter was really useful.  There is a small Coles supermarket at the petrol station nearby (right at the end of the road) and there is a Woolworths, plenty of restaurants and smaller shops in Kingsgrove. George is very friendly and willing to help in any way he can during your stay.

Stores and supermarkets are conveniently located within walking distance from the house so you can conveniently grab anything you need in a jiffy. Liza was very laid-back, courteous, respectful of my privacy and also helpful with directions, anything that I needed and recommendations of stores that I wanted to go to.

Pur essendo, come molti appartamenti a New York, un seminterrato, ha una porta a vetri che dà sulla scaletta esterna del giardino ed è quindi luminoso. Cucina completa, letto comodissimo, l'unico spazio condiviso è la doccia al piano superiore ma privacy e libertà di movimento sono garantiti. Il wi-fi funziona perfettamente e il riscaldamento è regolabile a piacere.\nConsiglio di darsi il tempo di scoprire il quartiere, industriale ma tranquillo e punteggiato di piccoli esercizi a pochi metri di distanza. Un prezioso ristorante vietnamita, un McDonalds, un punto vendita Staples (dove si possono andare a stampare self-service le carte d'imbarco o qualsiasi cosa) sono veramente a cinque passi. A poca distanza piccoli supermercati, bar, negozi di qualsiasi tipo. Con quindici/venti minuti di passeggiata si raggiunge la stazione della linea L a Graham Avenue, accanto a un negozio di frutta e verdura fresca sempre aperto. Liza sarà lieta di darvi consigli e, se lo gradite, il fantastico gatto Mr. William vi terrà compagnia come se fosse vostro, senza lasciarvi mai soli.

Described as a private apartment, it only sort of fits that bill. It shares a corridor with the laundry room and is accessed through the host's apartment, and is therefore (to me) only semi-private. Being what it is, i.e. a basement-type space, it was  honestly a little clammy, dusty, and smelly, though clearly Liza has made efforts to spruce it up. There aren't a lot of shops or restaurants in the immediate vicinity; there is however lots of good stuff provided one is able to walk a mile or so; same thing with a subway stop. Liza was communicative, clear and friendly, but I will probably decide next time to pay a little more for something more private, and maybe closer to transit/food."},{"_id":"338090240","date":{"$date":"2018-10-18T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17446640","reviewer_id":"153877725","reviewer_name":"Jacques","comments":"Convenient place close to pleasant areas in WBrooklyn and métro stations to Manhattan"},{"_id":"339987766","date":{"$date":"2018-10-22T04:00:00.000Z"},"listing_id":"17446640","reviewer_id":"154807510","reviewer_name":"Chloe","comments":"Liza's place was great.

While the L train is a quick 10 minute walk from the Airbnb, it was sadly closed for most of our stay. The G train is about a 20 minute (1 mile) walk. Liza leaves great recommendations for food \u0026 drink (Little Dokebi is so good and so affordable, and you must get the mashed potatoes at Conchord Hill), but the neighborhood has much to explore. We loved the shops/gift stores and cafes (go get ice cream at Van Leeuwen's! Oh, and the rainbow bagel is just around the corner from the L!), and it's also convenient to other great amenities like the Brooklyn Museum (just a few bucks in a Lyft). Manhattan is easy enough to get to as well, but I prefer the Brooklyn experience when in New York. The Greenpoint neighborhood is safe and the Airbnb is very secure and cozy. The shared shower was not an issue and the Airbnb itself was spacious. I enjoyed having a couch, easy-to-find outlets, a kitchen area, and a clean bathroom.

It is steps from Saint Laurent  and 5 minute walk to Mont Royal station. So much good food and amazing coffee around the corner. Had an almond milk flat white every morning at Paquebot!!! There is a park around the corner and a grocery store at the end of the street. Even though there wasn’t air conditioning the apartment was quiet cool being on the bottom level. Although it was still very bright with the sliding doors!! Gabriel was quick to respond and checkin and checkout was very smooth and easy!! I highly recommend staying at Gabriel’s!!"}]}
